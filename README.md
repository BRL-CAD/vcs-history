Historical Version Control records of BRL-CAD repositories

BRL-CAD has migrated its history from one software version control system to
another multiple times in its history.

While the project has striven to retain the fidelity of its history in these
conversions, the nature of the problem makes it difficult (or impossible,
really) to retain all the quirks and nuances of the original VCS data in a
new environment.

Accordingly, this repository holds the original data for BRL-CAD's CVS and
SVN histories.  If a problem should ever be discovered with the Git conversion
of this history, this repository will preserve the original inputs to allow
for direct inspection of the original data.
