@Building
========

The build process for Rt^3 utilizes the GNU Build System and make.
Although using the autotools should considerably simplify building
Rt^3 on other systems, the only systems presently officially supported
are the following:

Apple Mac OS X 10.3+
Linux 2.4+
SGI IRIX 6.5+

Support for additional systems may be considered with sufficient
encouragement or justification.  That stated, the build is constantly
tested on a variety of systems.


Quick Start
-----------

To get up and running quickly:

./configure
make
make install

If there is no configure script, then one will need to be generated by
running the autogen.sh script (./autogen.sh).
