Getting Rt^3
------------

The entire distribution is provided in binary and source form for a
variety of platforms.  If you are reading this, then you probably
already have it.


Compilation
-----------

For more details on building the sources and options available, see
the INSTALL file.  To build the sources and get up and running with
default settings, run the following commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make


Installation
------------

Performing a "make install" after compilation with the appropriate
permissions will install the sources into the specified location.  By
default, the installation is set to /usr/local and may be changed by
using the --prefix option during configuration.  Example:

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/brlcad
make
sudo make install

See the INSTALL file for more information.
