@                       BRL-CAD Website
                     http://brlcad.sf.net
                      http://brlcad.org

BRL-CAD is a powerful Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling
system. BRL-CAD includes an interactive geometry editor, ray tracing
support for rendering and geometric analysis, network distributed
framebuffer support, image-processing and signal-processing tools. The
entire package is distributed in source code and binary form.

This is the website for BRL-CAD.

The website is maintained separately from BRL-CAD as a separate
installation module.  The primarly intent of the website module is to
provide web developers with an isolated location for the website
sourcecode to live version-controlled.

See the NEWS file for more details on the latest events regarding the
BRL-CAD website.


Installation
============

Assuming that there is a web server installed already, and that php is
properly configured, it should be sufficient to point a web root url
to the htdocs/ directory to get the website up and running.  There
should be no preprocessing or preparation of the website sourcecode
necessary for it to be useable.  The primary BRL-CAD website should
automatically be updating to the latest version stored within this
module on a daily basis.

Presently, the sole requirement for install is PHP 4 and a capable web
server such as Apache.  The website may talk to a local SQL database
at some point in the future, but there should be no assumptions of a
need to make an external network connection.

Scripts to install the website in a SourceForge-similar arrangement
are included in the misc/ directory.  This includes a cron job and an
install script.

Installation is described in more detail in the INSTALL file.


Contributing
============

If you'd like to get involved in making improvements to the BRL-CAD
website, please see the DEVINFO file.  It contains more details on the
do's and don'ts and what is expected of the website developers.


Contact
=======

Please contact one of the active developers listed in the AUTHORS
file, or interact with the developers on the Sourceforge project site.
There are forums and newsgroups available to ask questions, make
suggestions, or to make comments.

Some of the BRL-CAD developers are also available via IRC in #brlcad
on the irc.freenode.net network.  See http://freenode.net/ and
http://www.irc.org/ for more information.

At most, it should be sufficient to point a web root url to the
htdocs/ directory.  There should be no preprocessing or preparation of
the website sourcecode for it to be used, as long as the required web
server components are installed.  The primary BRL-CAD website will
automatically update to the version stored within this module
periodically (nightly).
