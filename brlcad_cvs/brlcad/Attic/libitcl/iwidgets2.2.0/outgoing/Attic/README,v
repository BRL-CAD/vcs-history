 ----------------- [incr Widgets] Outgoing Widgets ---------------------
==========================================================================

  This directory contains mega-widgets which appear to be failing in 
public acceptance.  The negative feedback has out paced the positive.
They still have doc, test, and demos, but should be considered on their
way out of the distribution.  If you are one of the minority which feels
differently as to the widgets usefullness, please copy it to a safe location.
It will not be around long.
