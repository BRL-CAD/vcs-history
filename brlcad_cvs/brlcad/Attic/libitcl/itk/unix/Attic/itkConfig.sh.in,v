# This shell script (for sh) is generated automatically by Itk's
# configure script.  It will create shell variables for most of
# the configuration options discovered by the configure script.
# This script is intended to be included by the configure scripts
# for Itk extensions so that they don't have to figure this all
# out for themselves.  This file does not duplicate information
# already provided by tclConfig.sh, tkConfig.sh or itclConfig.sh,
# so you may need to use those files in addition to this one.
#
# The information in this file is specific to a single platform.

# Itcl's version number.

# files, this points to the location of the sources, not the location
