@# Tcl package index file, version 1.0
# This file is generated by the "pkg_mkIndex" command
# and sourced either when an application starts up or
# by a "package unknown" script.  It invokes the
# "package ifneeded" command to set up package-related
# information so that packages will be loaded automatically
# in response to "package require" commands.  When this
# script is sourced, the variable $dir must contain the
# full path name of this file's directory.

package ifneeded http 2.0 [list tclPkgSetup $dir http 2.0 {{http.tcl source {::http::config ::http::formatQuery ::http::geturl ::http::reset ::http::wait}}}]
