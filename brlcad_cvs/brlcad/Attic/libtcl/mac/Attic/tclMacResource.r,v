 * The mechanisim below loads Tcl source into the resource fork of the

 * "Init" from the file "init.tcl".  This allows applications to use
 * Tcl to define the behavior of the application without having to
 * require some predetermined file structure - all needed Tcl "files"
 * are located within the application.  To source a file for the
 * resource fork the source command has been modified to support
 * sourcing from resources.  In the below case "source -rsrc {Init}"
 * will load the TEXT resource named "Init".

 * resource id if it conflicts with your application.)  Each string in
 * the resource must be of the form "KEYWORD=SOME STRING".  See Tcl
 * documentation for futher information about the env variable.
 *
 * A good example of something you may want to set is: "TCL_LIBRARY=My
