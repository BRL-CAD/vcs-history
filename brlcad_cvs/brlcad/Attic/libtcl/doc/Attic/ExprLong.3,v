Interpreter in whose context to evaluate \fIstring\fR or \fIobjPtr\fR.

Expression to be evaluated.  Must be in writable memory (the expression
parser makes temporary modifications to the string during parsing, which
it undoes before returning).

Pointer to location in which to store the integer value of the
expression.

Pointer to location in which to store the floating-point value of the
expression.

Pointer to location in which to store the 0/1 boolean value of the
expression.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These four procedures all evaluate the expression
given by the \fIstring\fR argument
and return the result in one of four different forms.
The expression can have any of the forms accepted by the \fBexpr\fR command.
Note that these procedures have been largely replaced by the
object-based procedures \fBTcl_ExprLongObj\fR, \fBTcl_ExprDoubleObj\fR,
\fBTcl_ExprBooleanObj\fR, and \fBTcl_ExprStringObj\fR.
Those object-based procedures evaluate an expression held in a Tcl object
instead of a string.
The object argument can retain an internal representation
that is more efficient to execute.
.PP
The \fIinterp\fR argument refers to an interpreter used to
evaluate the expression (e.g. for variables and nested Tcl
commands) and to return error information.
\fIinterp->result\fR is assumed to be initialized
in the standard fashion when they are invoked.
.PP
For all of these procedures the return value is a standard
Tcl result: \fBTCL_OK\fR means the expression was successfully
evaluated, and \fBTCL_ERROR\fR means that an error occurred while
evaluating the expression.
If \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned then
\fIinterp->result\fR will hold a message describing the error.
If an error occurs while executing a Tcl command embedded in
the expression then that error will be returned.
.PP
If the expression is successfully evaluated, then its value is
returned in one of four forms, depending on which procedure
is invoked.
\fBTcl_ExprLong\fR stores an integer value at \fI*longPtr\fR.
If the expression's actual value is a floating-point number,
then it is truncated to an integer.
If the expression's actual value is a non-numeric string then
an error is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_ExprDouble\fR stores a floating-point value at \fI*doublePtr\fR.
If the expression's actual value is an integer, it is converted to
floating-point.
If the expression's actual value is a non-numeric string then
an error is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_ExprBoolean\fR stores a 0/1 integer value at \fI*booleanPtr\fR.
If the expression's actual value is an integer or floating-point
number, then they store 0 at \fI*booleanPtr\fR if
the value was zero and 1 otherwise.
If the expression's actual value is a non-numeric string then
it must be one of the values accepted by \fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR
such as ``yes'' or ``no'', or else an error occurs.
.PP
\fBTcl_ExprString\fR returns the value of the expression as a
string stored in \fIinterp->result\fR.
If the expression's actual value is an integer
then \fBTcl_ExprString\fR converts it to a string using \fBsprintf\fR
with a ``%d'' converter.
If the expression's actual value is a floating-point
number, then \fBTcl_ExprString\fR calls \fBTcl_PrintDouble\fR
to convert it to a string.
