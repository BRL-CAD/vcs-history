.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
char
\fBTcl_Backslash\fR(\fIsrc, countPtr\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS char *countPtr
.AP char *src in
Pointer to a string starting with a backslash.

If \fIcountPtr\fR isn't NULL, \fI*countPtr\fR gets filled
in with number of characters in the backslash sequence, including
the backslash character.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.VS 8.1
The use of \fBTcl_Backslash\fR is deprecated in favor of
\fBTcl_UtfBackslash\fR.
.PP
This is a utility procedure provided for backwards compatibilty with
non-internationalized Tcl extensions.  It parses a backslash sequence and
returns the low byte of the Unicode character corresponding to the sequence. 
.VE
\fBTcl_Backslash\fR modifies \fI*countPtr\fR to contain the number of
characters in the backslash sequence.
.PP
See the Tcl manual entry for information on the valid backslash sequences.
All of the sequences described in the Tcl manual entry are supported by
\fBTcl_Backslash\fR.
