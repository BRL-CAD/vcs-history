.SH NAME
flush \- Flush buffered output for a channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBflush \fIchannelId\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Flushes any output that has been buffered for \fIchannelId\fR.
\fIChannelId\fR must be a channel identifier such as returned by a previous
\fBopen\fR or \fBsocket\fR command, and it must have been opened for writing.
If the channel is in blocking mode the command does not return until all the
buffered output has been flushed to the channel. If the channel is in
nonblocking mode, the command may return before all buffered output has been
flushed; the remainder will be flushed in the background as fast as the
underlying file or device is able to absorb it.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
open(n), socket(n)

.SH KEYWORDS
blocking, buffer, channel, flush, nonblocking, output
