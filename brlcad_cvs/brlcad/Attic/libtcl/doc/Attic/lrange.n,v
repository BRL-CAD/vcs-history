.SH NAME
lrange \- Return one or more adjacent elements from a list
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlrange \fIlist first last\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIList\fR must be a valid Tcl list.  This command will
return a new list consisting of elements
\fIfirst\fR through \fIlast\fR, inclusive.
\fIFirst\fR or \fIlast\fR
may be \fBend\fR (or any abbreviation of it) to refer to the last
element of the list.
If \fIfirst\fR is less than zero, it is treated as if it were zero.
If \fIlast\fR is greater than or equal to the number of elements
in the list, then it is treated as if it were \fBend\fR.
If \fIfirst\fR is greater than \fIlast\fR then an empty string
is returned.
Note: ``\fBlrange \fIlist first first\fR'' does not always produce the
same result as ``\fBlindex \fIlist first\fR'' (although it often does
for simple fields that aren't enclosed in braces); it does, however,
produce exactly the same results as ``\fBlist [lindex \fIlist first\fB]\fR''
