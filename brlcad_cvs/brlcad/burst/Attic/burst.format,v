large negative values (ie -270.0000).

@This is the official release of version 2.0 which includes mods in the
output format to both correct a misinterpretation of the ICD, facilitate
easier postprocessing, increase precision, etc.  Also an option to not
require burst air was added.  Finally, a bug fix involving adjacent inside
airs of the same type at the beginning of a shotline was implemented.
