text
@2007-10-23  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/conf/PATCH: update to final 7.10.4 version

	* NEWS:
	added release notes and updated version for 7.10.4, beginning of final 
release preparations

2007-10-23  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c: MFC

2007-10-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libdm/dm-pex.c:
	whoops, here's to reviewing all commit e-mails even when I make them.. 
apparently edited out the wrong line for noalias.h

	* src/librt/vshoot.c, src/libwdb/wdb.c, src/util/pixhalve.c, 
doc/deprecation.txt, include/Makefile.am, include/noalias-prag.h, 
include/noalias.h, src/libbn/mat.c, src/libbu/bitv.c, src/libbu/ptbl.c, 
src/libdm/dm-pex.c, src/librt/g_arb.c, src/librt/g_arbn.c, src/librt/g_ell.c, 
src/librt/g_half.c, src/librt/g_pg.c, src/librt/g_rec.c, src/librt/g_sph.c, 
src/librt/g_tgc.c, src/librt/g_torus.c, src/librt/tree.c:
	removed the non-ansi/stc compliant noalias.h and noalias-prag.h headers 
that were used with the cray (and alliant) to make pragma decls before loops.  
made obsolete long ago with the move to ansi compliance.

	* src/other/jove/jove_tune.c, src/remrt/remrt.c, src/remrt/rtsrv.c, 
src/rt/do.c, include/bu.h, include/db.h, include/machine.h, include/vectfont.h, 
src/lgt/ir.c, src/lgt/lgt.c, src/libbn/fortran.c, src/libbu/bu_tcl.c, 
src/libbu/parse.c, src/libdm/dm-X.c, src/libdm/dm-pex.c, src/libdm/dm-tk.c, 
src/liboptical/sh_stxt.c, src/liborle/rle.c, src/librt/g_ebm.c, 
src/librt/g_ell.c, src/librt/g_nmg.c, src/librt/g_rec.c, src/librt/g_sph.c, 
src/librt/g_tgc.c, src/librt/g_vol.c, src/librt/parse.c, 
src/libtermio/termio.c, src/other/jove/jove.h:
	the old cray cos and unicos code for the cray xmp and friends finally 
became a burden to maintain while resolving various flawfinder issues.  remove 
the old code, particularly that which wasn't __STDC__.  however, intentionally 
leave the code for calculating byteoffsets and converting float formats to/from 
network order .. could still come in handy at some point down the road.

2007-10-22  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c: don't assume the suffix starts with a '.'

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	retain 2nd (3rd? 87th?) number if no -c option is given

2007-10-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/config_win.h, src/fb/fb-pix.c, src/fb/fb-png.c, 
src/mged/rtif.c, src/rt/do.c:
	wrong direction bob.. working to remove _all_ instances of _WIN32 not 
in a core library.  besides, using chmod() is actually has a fundamental race 
condition flaw that is a security violation; and causes the new flawfinder 
regression test to fail.  hopefully msvc has _fchmod() like the other posix 
funcs it supports prefixed.  if not, need to add a libbu compatibility routine.

2007-10-22  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	change get_name() to return a bu_vls instead of a char*

	* src/libdm/dm-generic.c, src/mged/cmd.c, src/mged/share.c, 
src/mged/vrlink.c:
	move to using the new bu_vls_strcmp macro

	* include/bu.h: silly coder, semicolons don't go there

	* include/bu.h: convenience wrappers for comparing vls's

2007-10-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/iges/add_loop.c, src/conv/iges/b-spline.c, 
src/conv/iges/check_names.c, src/conv/iges/g-iges.c, 
src/conv/iges/get_vertex.c, src/conv/iges/iges.c, src/conv/iges/make_face.c, 
src/conv/iges/make_nurb_face.c, src/conv/iges/orient_loops.c, 
src/conv/iges/trimsurf.c, src/conv/jack/g-jack.c, src/conv/jack/jack-g.c, 
src/conv/off/g-off.c, src/conv/off/off-g.c, src/conv/patch/patch-g.c, 
src/conv/euclid-g.c, src/conv/g-acad.c, src/conv/g-dxf.c, src/conv/g-obj.c, 
src/conv/g-shell.rect.c, src/conv/g-stl.c, src/conv/g-tankill.c, 
src/conv/g-var.c, src/conv/g-vrml.c, src/conv/g-x3d.c, src/conv/g-xxx.c, 
src/conv/g-xxx_facets.c, src/conv/nastran-g.c, src/conv/nmg-bot.c, 
src/conv/nmg-rib.c, src/conv/ply-g.c:
	whoosh, another 10% complete on the bu_bomb to bu_exit conversion 
review.  also includes a slew of custom exit() calls that can use bu_exit() as 
well as toning down a slew of overzealous exclamation point use.  (20% complete 
overall)

2007-10-22  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c: crude -c functionality

	* src/mged/clone.c: start stubbing in the -c stuff

	* src/libbu/htester.c:
	Add missing include for bu.h. Fixed sign issues. Rearranged and 
modernized.
	Added -v (version) flag and improved argument checking.

	* src/libbu/semaphore.c: make i unsigned to match nsemaphores

	* src/conv/g-nmg.c:
	use bu_exit() instead of bu_log() on unknown argument (I think that's 
what was intended... segfaults using bu_log with given args)

2007-10-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/canon/png-ipu.c: more bu_bomb to bu_exit conversions

	* src/conv/asc-nmg.c, src/conv/asc2g.c, src/conv/bot_shell-vtk.c, 
src/conv/cy-g.c, src/conv/euclid-g.c, src/conv/euclid_format.c, 
src/conv/fast4-g.c, src/conv/g-acad.c, src/conv/g-dxf.c, src/conv/g-euclid.c, 
src/conv/g-euclid1.c, src/conv/g-nff.c, src/conv/g-nmg.c, src/conv/g-obj.c:
	first 10% of the review of the bu_bomb() instances.  updating many to 
bu_exit() for the instances where the error or exit condition aren't 
catastrophic errors (i.e. they wouldn't benefit from having a stack trace of 
how we got into that state code-wise).  this also makes it easier to refactor 
usages of log & exit too to the new routine.

	* include/bu.h, include/nmg.h: tweak debug log messages for consistency

	* src/conv/dxf-g.c:
	refactor and use the new bu_exit() instead of bombing on normal exit 
conditions.  also fix a bug where specifying the the same filename for the dxf 
and g file would result in it actually 'working' because it called wdb_open() 
to open/create the the .g output file before checking if the dxf exists.  
really minor but happened to run into it when 'dxf-g asdf asdf' surprisingly 
completed successfuly

	* regress/slave_build.sh, regress/spdi.sh, regress/weight.sh, 
regress/Makefile.am, regress/flawfinder.sh, regress/gqa.sh, regress/iges.sh, 
regress/lights.sh, regress/main.sh, regress/master_fetch.sh, 
regress/master_prep.sh, regress/moss.sh, regress/nightly.sh, regress/shaders.sh:
	more consistent echo output

	* regress/solids.sh:
	more consistent echo output, use rt suffix for the solids.rt render 
script

	* NEWS:
	user-visible change.. removed longjmp warning message from applications 
that was called during bu_bomb's where an application exception handler was 
registered.  this was a common cause for confusion in the converters that use 
the jump handler during normal operations quite frequently -- made it look like 
the application was repeatedly 'crashing' during conversion yet the application 
would keep processing.

	* src/libbu/bomb.c:
	stfu about the longjmp handler being taken.  the user doesn't care and 
the message is rather misleading.

	* src/rt/viewedge.c: oops, remove debugging

	* include/bu.h, src/libbu/bomb.c:
	add a new bu_exit() function that never returns.  this function differs 
from bu_bomb() in that it supports an error code and printf style arguments.  
it should not be used for 'exceptional' exit conditions where stability and 
validity are in question; it should be used when you simply want to politely 
exit the application after printing a message (like printing application usage 
and exiting).

	* src/libbu/log.c:
	don't call va_start until after making sure it's not a null format

	* src/rt/viewedge.c: ws expand for readability

	* TODO: eliminate vararg and non-ansi cray-specific support code

2007-10-21  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BUGS: works with -P1

	* BUGS:
	rtedge seems to get stuck in a loop at the end of rendering, has to be 
killed

	* src/conv/dxf-g.c:
	don't bomb on usage.  bu_bomb is now only abnormal exit conditions.

	* doc/deprecation.txt, include/raytrace.h:
	removed wdb_tree_cmd(), added to dg_obj.c as dgo_tree_cmd()

2007-10-20  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_arbn.c:
	When an arbn is imported with a non-identity matrix, the import routine 
assumes unit normal vectors. The code now unitizes the normals prior to 
applying the matrix. This fixes bug #1800148 - arbn is incorrectly mirrored

2007-10-19  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/rt/do.c: Minor mod for Windows.

	* misc/win32-msvc7/brlcad/brlcad.sln, 
misc/win32-msvc7/libwdb/libwdb.vcproj, misc/win32-msvc7/mged/mged.vcproj, 
misc/win32-msvc7/tclsh/tclsh.vcproj:
	Updates for getting things to compile again.

	* include/raytrace.h: Added a function declaration for dgo_tree_cmd.

	* src/fb/fb-pix.c, src/fb/fb-png.c: Minor mods for Windows.

	* src/librt/dg_obj.c: dgo_cmd already declared in raytrace.h

	* src/mged/attach.c, src/mged/ged.c, src/mged/rtif.c:
	Minor mods for getting things compiled on Windows.

	* src/other/libpng/png.h:
	Mod for Windows to expose a few deprecated functions for tkimg.

	* src/other/tcl/generic/tclInt.h:
	Mods for getting BLT to compile on Windows.

	* src/other/tcl/win/tclWinPort.h:
	Conditionally undef INCL_WINSOCK_API_TYPEDEFS before defining.

	* misc/win32-msvc7/tkimg/tkimg.vcproj:
	Update to accomodate the earlier reorganization.

2007-10-18  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/win32-msvc7/liboptical/liboptical.vcproj:
	Updates to accomodate the earlier reorganization.

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libbu/libbu.vcproj, 
misc/win32-msvc7/wish/wish.vcproj:
	Update to accomodate the earlier reorganization.

2007-10-18  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/Makefile.am, src/adrt/config.h:
	configure generated files should not be in CVS

2007-10-18  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/fbserv/fbserv.c, src/gtools/g_qa.c, src/gtools/g_transfer.c, 
src/fb/fb-orle.c, src/fb/fb-rle.c, src/fb/fbgammamod.c, src/fb/pixflip-fb.c, 
src/fbed/extern.h, src/fbed/fbed.c, src/fbed/getfont.c, src/burst/ui.c,

src/conv/proe-g.c, src/external/Cubit/g-sat.cxx, 
src/external/Unigraphics/ug-g.c, src/fb/cat-fb.c:
	more quellings of level 4 flawfinder issues

2007-10-17  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Dm.tcl:
	fix a nasty startup delay in a particular viewer app that uses the Mged 
megawidget (which in turn uses the Display megawidget, which uses Dm, which had 
a :0 hard-coded).  this fixes the bug by making it use the DISPLAY environment 
variable.

2007-10-17  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/isst/master/compnet.c:
	Include adrt_common.h so ADRT_NAME_SIZE gets defined. Add RCS tag.

2007-10-17  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libtk/libtk.vcproj,

src/tclscripts/archer/images/Themes/Crystal_Large/measure.png, 
src/tclscripts/archer/images/Themes/Windows/compSelect.png, 
src/tclscripts/archer/images/Themes/Windows/measure.png:
	Minor update.

	* src/tclscripts/swidgets/scripts/tree.itk:
	Added an optional doDraw parameter to the insert method.

2007-10-17  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	there was a segment -> BVSegment<BV> replacement missing

2007-10-17  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/brlcad.def:
	include the other symbols that are currently being used in ef windows 
module

	* include/conf/MINOR, include/conf/PATCH:
	we're already on 7.11 for head, next release after 7.10.4 release will 
be a minor revision release at 7.12.0.

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	try just getting rid of the typedef -- does this work in vc6?

2007-10-17  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	the last change crashed the build with MSVC V6.0 compiler
	made an ifdef for this compiler

2007-10-17  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	fix a truely bizarre VC8 compilation error (spawning from warning 
C4346) where we either have to get rid of the typdefs or add this typename 
qualifier.  docs purport that this is actually compliance required, so go with 
it.

	* NEWS, src/rt/opt.c:
	john noticed that the -g and -G options were not working on the rt apps 
anymore due to the change to the default aspect from 1.0 to 0.0; and sure 
enough, he was right.  the aspect ratio change (made several years ago!) was 
for the -V view aspect option, but obviously had other users in other files 
that used the value.  this changes the default back to 1.0 while also adding a 
sanity check into the argument processor to make sure the aspect ratio is 
always a sane value.

	* src/tclscripts/helplib.tcl: update the usage to reflect the change

	* NEWS:
	mged 'tree' command now shows e'd objects instead of returning a usage 
error, processing the geometry that is e'd up on the display.

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c, src/mged/cmd.c, src/librt/dg_obj.c:
	change wdb_tree_cmd() to dgo_tree_cmd() so that we can have access to 
the display geometry (particularly, to get access to the 'who' command).  
modify the behavior of the mged 'tree' command so that if you don't provide it 
any options, it will display the tree for all objects displayed.  this is in 
response and inspired by a tcl snippet from david loman that needed this 
functionality to aid in analyzing gqa output.

	* include/bu.h:
	add GCC attribute declarations (when we're compiling with GCC of 
course) that help the compiler know that a particular function has printf-style 
arguments or is a function that never returns.  add the attributes to the likes 
of bu_log, bu_flog, and bu_bomb.  code inspired from bz, thx.

	* src/libbu/log.c:
	put comments on their own line.  was going to add code to bu_log() to 
try and detect when there are no ... args, but it does not seem to work (at 
least on mac os x) as va_arg keeps scanning past the end giving the wrong count!

2007-10-16  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h:
	prevent crashing on a whole slew of cases where we end up iterating 
over either a null, uninitialized, or malformed list item.  the current for 
loop while condition has to be non-NULL in order to do the next iteration, so 
make sure of it.  this prevents a crash that was detected in the display 
geometry object (where it had unitialized data).

2007-10-16  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl:
	add firefox to browser list for help->manual

2007-10-16  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/external/Cubit/g-sat.cxx:
	update to the latest API changes where create_body_from_surfs() seems 
to have chnaged to create_solid_bodies_from_surfs() in the GeometryModifyTool 
class.  looks like it just changed to return a list of bodies instead of one 
body, so we iterate over the bodies.  this is entirely untested, but seems 
right according to the docs at 
https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/ITAPS/cgm/trunk/geom/

	* doc/Makefile.am, configure.ac:
	add the new docbook documentation to the dist

2007-10-15  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* regress/gqa.sh: exit, not return

	* src/libdm/query.c:
	merge dm_bestXType fix in from head, this should quell the failure 
warnings that the m2 folks are seeing.

	* src/libdm/query.c:
	don't blather the error message if the display cannot be opened.  
cleanup the logic a bit too to print a message if a detected type being tested 
for validity simply wasn't available during compilation.

	* misc/debian/.cvsignore: ignore generated changelog

	* src/rt/view.c:
	rip out the dead code.  it's in CVS is someone ever really does need it 
to be reinstated, but the restart code would need modifications for preserving 
proper gamma correction regardless.  so in leu of compile-time disabling it, 
just take the code out and simply for now.

	* NEWS:
	oops, don't forget to credit adam ross too .. the original author did 
have a bit of influence on the implementation.  also mention erik upgrading 
bundled libpng to 1.2.21

include/Makefile.am:
	remove the MAINTAINERCLEAN rules, they're never really used regardless 
of the debate over whether the Makefile.in files belong there or not

	* src/tab/Makefile.am: bad resort on trailing slash

	* src/tab/Makefile.am:
	see if that helps the distcheck, declare and clean the build source 
file from the lexer

2007-10-02  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bench/Makefile.am:
	set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH so that we can find 
tcl/tk prior to installation

	* src/tab/Makefile.am:
	disable scriptsort if we don't have a suitable lexer/parser since it 
needs a lexer (fixes build on mjm)

	* src/tab/scriptsort.c: declare yyin

2007-10-02  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	LIBS instead of LDFLAGS to hold library names (thanks to frbrgeorge for 
spotting this one)

	* src/rt/view.c: Disable image restart.

	* bench/run.sh: Add another path for RT.
	Search for 'moss.g' in $DB and cull (so if the .g's are in a different 
dir than $(top_srcdir)/db, the right path is used).

2007-10-02  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	implement a lighting model for rt that visualizes how expensive each 
pixel is to compute via some heat graph.

	* TODO, doc/deprecation.txt:
	move the deprecation items to their own file so that they can actually 
be preserved in a running log of API changes, including basic guidelines for 
how to go from deprecated to obsolete.

	* TODO:
	there are a variety of install and post-install support scripts now, 
aside from being an overly vague/generic todo item

	* include/shortvect-pr.h, include/shortvect.h, TODO, 
include/Makefile.am, include/msr.h, include/rtlist.h, include/rtstring.h:
	already deprecated since 7.0, consider the following files finally 
obsolete for the next minor update: msr.h, rtstring.h, rtlist.h, shortvect.h, 
shortvect-pr.h;  the contents of those files moved into or were replace by 
functionality in the bu.h header

	* TODO: dupe

	* TODO:
	archer is now functional, at least seems to be fully functional now on 
Mac OS X with the slew of resource and library mods that were needed.  archer 
runs both installed an even uninstalled from a compiled source directory.

	* src/archer/archer:
	the mighty bob lieth not.  blt_library really _does_ need to be set 
AFTER blt is loaded.  the variable is wiped out during Blt_Init() yet is 
subsequently required/expected in the Tabnotebook.  this is the final mod that 
actually makes Archer work on Mac OS X (tested, and seemingly fully functional) 
and probably on Linux and BSD too now.

	* src/archer/archer:
	additional try/catch checking for archer so that we can print better 
abort messages when things go horribly wrong

	* src/other/blt/src/bltInit.c:
	the minimum version checks are bogus for the pre-release alpha 
distribution, it needs to check all the way down to the patch level

	* src/tclscripts/archer/LoadArcherLibs.tcl:
	blt is actually already loaded as part of the preload in the main 
archer script, so don't need this load here

2007-10-01  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/prep.c:
	prevent generating a crash report when we simply don't have any work to 
do or when the requested geometry doesn't exist.  don't bomb, just quit.

	* src/other/blt/src/bltInit.c:
	shouldn't need to be exact.. allow versions of the library that are not 
matching but potentially newer.

	* src/other/blt/Makefile.am, src/other/blt/src/Makefile.am:
	bltVecCmd only applies to version 7 of tcl, so don't even compile it to 
avoid symbol warnings

	* src/other/tkimg/Makefile.am:
	tclstub library is very much needed so that the module will dynamically 
load without unresolved symbols (e.g. as a dylib on mac os x)

	* src/libbu/bu_tcl.c:
	fail quietly with bu_brlcad_data and bu_brlcad_root instead of 
verbosely ... could later add a --verbose option if it's really needed in 
scripting-land.

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	need to only return successful if we find it, otherwise needs to return 
NULL

	* src/tclscripts/archer/LoadArcherLibs.tcl:
	comment on sharedlibextension

	* src/tclscripts/archer/LoadArcherLibs.tcl:
	load tkimg and blt during initialization and report the error 
appropriately if the load fails.

	* src/archer/archer: tkimg works if you load the .so

	* TODO:
	aiight, so tkimg does actually work .. probably still need to clean up 
how it's presently imported but it does work, so off the list

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	more robust checking using bu_brlcad_data searching

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	restructure to allow uninstalled source directory invocations, as well 
as not making failure to find/load plugins fatal.

	* src/archer/archer:
	variety of minor restructuring. use bu_brlcad_data more 
intelligently/consistently relying on it also working with uninstalled builds.  
disable the splash logo since tkimg isn't integrated correctly yet (still also 
have a problem with blt too).  get rid of the massive auto_path hack since 
that's handled by libtclcad/bwish much more aggressively.

	* TODO:
	tkimg isn't working right and seems to be a bit dated, need to reimport 
it at some point

	* src/archer/plugins/Wizards/tankwizardIA.tcl:
	look a little harder -- including looking in a source path for 
uninstalled resources

	* src/bwish/Makefile.am, src/bwish/main.c:
	preinit blt.  only used by archer and unfortunately the lib seems to be 
a dead/abandoned project atm, but since we use it, preinit helps.

	* src/other/blt/Makefile.am, src/other/blt/src/Makefile.am:
	don't need/want bltUnitMain as that's for bltsh

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	fugly modification to permit running from finding uninstalled source 
directory resources (e.g. tclscripts).  searches for this particular file for 
finding whether we're in a recognizable source directory.  only search four 
levels deep (should be enough for archer/mged in most of the hierarchy).

	* configure.ac: subst BLT and TKIMG so they can be used

	* BUGS:
	jra noticed that rt options -g and -G no longer work due to change in 
default aspect from 1 to 0.

2007-09-29  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_arbn.c:
	When an arbn is raytraced, the surface normal reported is whatever was 
provided by the arbn creator, even if it is not a unit vector. This produces a 
scaling effect on shading. The prep routine now unitizes the normal vector. 
This fixes bug #1800161.

	* TODO:
	clone and tracker are pretty much done, need some tender loving care 
and testing

	* NEWS:
	oop, don't forget the lil ol 'tracker' command that was done early on; 
all to be announced for 7.12

	* NEWS: new mged 'clone' object copy command

	* NEWS:
	merged from head was lingering framebuffer windows, red command, and 
.mgedrc editor setting

	* NEWS:
	separate out the 7.11 section so the STABLE branch can be kept in sync 
more easily

	more merging from HEAD.  bring in build system tweakage updates that 
should fix some library symbol problems from croping up post-release.

	* configure.ac: partial merge from head for the xno fix

	* src/proc-db/pix2g.c: take the blame

	* src/tclscripts/helplib.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl, 
src/tclscripts/mged/text.tcl:
	merge from head, tab completion and .mgedrc fix

	* src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl:
	fix the .mgedrc saving. this was actually an 8.5 issue -- [font names] 
is no longer empty.  Tk now provides five fonts by default (TkCaptionFont 
TkTooltipFont TkHeadingFont TkTextFont TkDefaultFont) which was causing mged to 
not initialize its own fonts (and later causing the tclscript error about the 
font variable not being set).  actually check for one of our fonts via 
mged_default(text_font)

2007-09-27  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/tedit.c: only report the basename of the editor

2007-09-27  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c: merge of V5 implementation from HEAD

2007-09-27  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/rt/view.c:
	patch/suggestion from Z80-Boy, round the gamma-corrected values to the 
nearest int consistently using floor()

	* BUGS: formatting

	* BUGS:
	nirt fails to report LOS and sometimes even hits on a BoT that is 
inverted or unoriented.  most annoying is that just sometimes fails to report a 
hit while other times it just fails to report an LOS thickness, even though it 
does find a hit.

2007-09-26  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libwdb/Makefile.am, src/libbn/Makefile.am, src/libdm/Makefile.am, 
src/libfft/Makefile.am, src/libmultispectral/Makefile.am, 
src/liboptical/Makefile.am, src/libpkg/Makefile.am, src/libsysv/Makefile.am, 
src/libtclcad/Makefile.am, src/libtermio/Makefile.am:
	the libraries really need to libadd all of their requisite dependencies 
or there will be unresolved symbols on platforms; this isn't just a libtool 
issue (libtool needs this info).  this change will hopefully help the build on 
a few other platforms, though I suspect there are still a few obscure cases 
(with buggy libtool) where unresolved symbols might be encountered with 
dynamic/shared libadd libraries not getting carried through to the linker line 
for binaries.

	* src/other/blt/library/.cvsignore: ignore generated pkgIndex.tcl

	* NEWS: lingering framebuffer windows are now the default

	* configure.ac:
	termio apparently needs TERMLIB (need to verify), and don't include the 
optional FB_LIBS since the Makefile.am takes care of it.  optical does use/need 
librt; tclcad needs libfb

	* src/libfb/if_4d.c, src/libfb/if_X.c, src/libfb/if_X24.c, 
src/libfb/if_ogl.c, src/libfb/if_sun.c, src/libfb/if_wgl.c:
	BAM! .. lingering windows is now the default.  it only took hundreds of 
complaints and 20 years of development.  this change makes it the default for 
most of the existing active framebuffer interface types, also adding a \\t\ 
option to complement the existing \\l\ option to allow folks to obtain the 
previous behavior if needed.  all this mode code really should be consolidated 
and made consistent, but that is a chore for another day.

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am:
	use FB_LIBS instead, pick up the other dependencies that are needed

	* src/libfb/if_wgl.c:
	do the same on windows, don't close our output channels

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	don't assume that stdout isn't being used, bu_log will likely someday 
be changed to log to out instead of err

	* src/librt/Makefile.am:
	use RT_LIBS since we need libbu and other libs that are missing.  
hopefully helps with unresolved symbols on ubuntu, but there's probably more 
cases like this that need fixing.

	* AUTHORS: nice work converting vol IV to docbook from brad harder

2007-09-25  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	use bu_vls_addr() instead of directly accessing the char*

	* src/mged/clone.c: some move to bu_vls strings

	* src/mged/clone.c: a mostly-functional v5 copy_v5_comb

	* src/mged/clone.c: minor simplification

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	pass a pointer instead of copying the string to stack

	* src/librt/db_comb.c:
	prefix mat_categorize with db_comb_ to kill an XXX, even though it's 
static

2007-09-25  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libdm/Makefile.am: ws

	* configure.ac:
	expand BLT_LIBRARY so it can be used in the blt pkgIndex.tcl file, 
generate the pkgIndex.tcl file and resort the src/other output entries correctly

	* src/other/blt/Makefile.am:
	the library is expected to be named libBLT with another that includes 
the dotless version as a suffix.

	* src/other/blt/library/pkgIndex.tcl, 
src/other/blt/library/pkgIndex.tcl.in:
	retemplatize pkgIndex.tcl so that the appropriate paths are searched 
for the blt library, include the source directory in the search just in case 
we're running uninstalled.

	* src/other/blt/win/makedefs: look for 8.5

2007-09-25  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libfb/libfb.3: mention fbhelp in the SEE ALSO

2007-09-25  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/util/brlcad.1: remove the references to /m/cad

	* NEWS:
	fixed crash in mged ls -A attribute listing command, related to karel's 
sf patch 1800301 (ls -A claimed to be accepted, isn't).  the arguments where 
getting checked with an off-by-one error, but even with that problem fixed -- 
the command would crash mged due to an avs being freed that was never 
initialized.  avs is now always freed too so the problem goes away.

	* src/tclscripts/helplib.tcl:
	change the help to the ls command to be a little more clear on what is 
expected of the special -A argument. this is in response to changes and repairs 
made in response to karel's sf patch 1800301 (ls -A claimed to be accepted, 
isn't).

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	fix the mged ls command's command argument processing.  A handful of 
off-by-one errors on the -A option processing, now rewritten to avoid the issue 
altogether by stripping off the command name and ay processed arguments.  now 
it also prints a better error message if the args to -A are incorrect.

	* src/librt/db_lookup.c:
	prevent a crash if we're using db5_get_attributes() and the object 
doesn't have any of the attributes we're looking for.  we need to at least 
initialize the avs to empty, otherwise bu_avs_free will abort on a magic number 
check.

	* src/librt/db_lookup.c: add braces for proper indent

	* src/mged/red.c: oop, no fp

	* NEWS:
	oop, also comment on the improved matrix readability on mged 'red' 
command.  this patch that was provided by karel adds a space after each row of 
the matrices being printed.

	* NEWS:
	mr. anderson fixed the dbconcat of empty combinations that was causing 
mged to crash.  adjust_names() in wdb_obj.c (part of dbconcat) was being passed 
comb->tree without checking for a null value.  john added a check for null and 
skips the combination (as null means it's an empty combination).  this fixes 
two bugs reported by karel kulhavy, sf bug 1800310 (ASCII import segfault in 
mged) and 1800306 (dbconcat segfaults).

	* src/mged/red.c:
	apply karel's same tweak to the tree listing as well for spacing out 
matrices one character per matrix line

	* AUTHORS: cliff is active

	* AUTHORS:
	include a unique/special/new section specfically for the folks that 
have worked on documentation.  this minimally includes betty schueler (mged 
tutorial vol2), eric edwards (VAST MAJORITY of the tutorial series vol1234), 
dwayne kregel (Principles of effective modeling vol3), and cliff yapp (docbook 
conversion efforts).  the developers are specifically *not* listed under the 
doc writer and other sections since they tend to apply to all of them, so make 
a note of that in the intro otherwise the list would be considerably longer and 
repetitious.

	* src/mged/red.c:
	apply Karel's sf patch 1800475 (improve ergonomoy of red) that provides 
improved matrix readability for mged 'red' command.  the change adds an 
additional space after each matrix line in the 'red' file being edited.

	* src/mged/Makefile.am, src/util/Makefile.am:
	missing linker libs causing run-time crashes due to missing symbols 
(lazy binding failures) on LIBDM .. it needs the DM_LIBS that were defined 
during configure (specifically the carbon framework in this instance for the 
application focus routine).

2007-09-24  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/make_deb.sh:
	Migrate to using "test" instead of square brackets. Fix missing test on 
compound statement

2007-09-24  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	missing the second test command for the WITH_OPENGL conditional, irix 
shell no likey

2007-09-23  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	Previous commit checked for null prior to call to adjust_names(), moved 
the null check into adjust_names().

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	adjust_names() was being called with a null comb->tree (an empty 
combination).
	Added a check for null comb->tree and skip call if so.
	This fixes bug [ 1800306 ] dbconcat segfaults.

2007-09-21  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/brlman/brlman.in: search the defined "mandir", too

2007-09-19  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libtclcad/tclcadAutoPath.c:
	search the archer paths for blt and the archer tclscripts

	* src/libtclcad/Makefile.am:
	search the blt dir for headers, needed for archer paths

2007-09-18  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	Display all newly generated objects, not just the first. Autoview after 
display.

	* NEWS: editor tcl variable

	* src/mged/tedit.c: search the tcl environment for an editor variable

	* src/mged/clone.c: rotation on v5 primivites

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	Fixed a bug with funky matrix manipulation. Fixed a bug with the old 
object
	being written with the new matrix applied.

	* src/mged/points/count.c: explicitely set id's type as int

	* src/mged/points/process.c:
	re-organize and clean up (fixing compiler warnings)

	* src/util/pl-X.c: fix sign difference

	* src/mged/qray.c:
	change (char)NULL to CNULL ( (char)0x0 ) to quiet the warnings about 
casting to different size

	* include/pkg.h, src/libpkg/pkg.c: mark the send buffers as const

	* src/gtools/beset/beset.h:
	missing semicolon on last element of struct (gcc eats it, but spits out 
a warning)

2007-09-17  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	don't mention the -pg flag now that it checks more than one

	* configure.ac: add a check for icc's -p gprof profile option

2007-09-16  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/html/manuals/mged/cup.g:
	don't put a v4 into the repository.  if we must stash .g files, then at 
least stash a v5 so that it's not platform-specific.  thanks to starseeker for 
pointing out the problem.

2007-09-15  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/tcl/unix/Makefile.in:
	sgi make doesn't like the bad makefile syntax (line separator leading 
to an empty line)

	more c89 embracing.  c89 provides string.h for all of the various 
str*() and mem*() functions, so remove the check for its presence.  there is 
still likely to be work required for strict c89 conformance for the various bsd 
strings.h functions that may be in use.

	* configure.ac, include/config_win.h, src/adrt/config.h, 
src/libbu/backtrace.c, src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	no longer need to conditionally check for time.h (or stddef.h) prior to 
use per c89

	* configure.ac:
	don't need the define for blt now that it defines what it needs in its 
own config header

	* include/common.h:
	oops, but the genie back in the bottle.  these don't need to go here.

src/adrt/config.h, src/fbserv/fbserv.c, src/libbu/parallel.c, src/mged/ged.c, 
src/mged/tedit.c:
	limits.h, locale.h, setjmp.g, and signal.h now all assumed as well as 
part of ongoing c89 migration.

	* src/other/blt/src/bltConfig.h:
	since we don't call blt's configure, make sure it knows that the c89 
headers are presumed.  this is intentionally here and not in the top-level 
configure to prevent repropagation of their use in the rest of the code.  blt 
should be a subconfigure.

	* configure.ac, include/config_win.h, include/vmath.h, 
src/adrt/config.h, src/conv/comgeom/mat.c, src/librt/g_pipe.c:
	math.h and float.h are also fair game, c89 baby

	* configure.ac, src/mged/ged.c:
	don't check for errno.h, we can assume at least c89 compliance

	* src/mged/ged.c, src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	don't bother checking for errno.h, it's c89

	* configure.ac: might as well also list the c89 and c95 headers

	* src/mk/mk_bolt.c, src/mk/mk_gastank.c, src/mk/mk_handle.c, 
src/mk/mk_winfrm.c, src/mk/mk_wire.c, src/other/blt/src/bltInt.h,

include/config_win.h, src/adrt/config.h, src/adrt/configure.ac, 
src/burst/extern.h, src/canon/canonlib.c, src/libbu/parallel.c, src/mged/ged.c:
	The c89 headers are all fair game since it's been a requirement since 
the move to ANSI c89 compliance.  So.. remove the HAVE_STDLIB_H checks and just 
use the header.  The headers <complex.h>, <fenv.h>, <inttypes.h>, <stdbool.h>, 
<stdint.h>, and <tgmath.h> were added with C99 and still need to be checked.  
There are several other c89 headers that we could just use, though, that are 
still being checked.

	re-add indices accidently clobbered when removing trailing whitespace. 
My bad.

	* src/mged/clone.c: minor cleanup

	* src/sig/coswin.c: include stdlib.h for malloc()

	* src/nirt/showshot.c: need common.h for config.h defines

	* include/bu.h:
	change various ints and longs to size_t for pointer/offset stuff

	* src/libbu/htester.c: cast to fix incompatible pointer warning

	* src/mged/clone.c: pad out multi-line and doxygen comments

2007-09-14  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/text.tcl:
	Greenwald identified a bug in tab expansion. I could not reproduce the 
segfault
	that he saw, but did add a check for an open database before attempting
	object expansion, and a check for a valid path prior to expansion.

2007-09-13  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/make_deb.sh: need devscripts, not debmake

2007-09-13  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* AUTHORS: o davisson

	* configure.ac, misc/debian/Makefile.am, misc/debian/changelog, 
misc/debian/changelog.in:
	automake has a braindead auto-inclusion of ChangeLog files that is 
causing make distcheck to fail when trying to include the debian 'changelog' 
file.  avoid the whole issue and make the file more generalized (auto-sets the 
version and time now) by turning it into an autoconf template instead.

2007-09-12  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/external/Makefile.am:
	automake 1.6 chokes on having EXTRA_DIST listed on multiple true/false 
contexts, and does not grok the += syntax.  it's still supported because it's 
still pretty prevalent, so back it up so EXTRA_DIST is only listed once.

	* TODO:
	update OpenNURBS to the July 2007 update, integrate changes with the 
fixes we already have made ourselves

	* NEWS: minor rewording

	* TODO:
	adrt seems to be pretty much working now, so call it 'done' too though 
there is more work that could probably occur on decoupling it from sdl and/or 
python given the trivial benefit gained.

	* NEWS:
	erik fixed an issue in the benchmark tool that was causing bad juju 
when it came time to compute the stats due to a 'log' variable shadowing a 
function in the script of the same name.  he renamed the function to lg and all 
reportedly is well with the world now on solaris (where this problem seemed to 
be isolated).

	* TODO:
	libtie updates from the muves team are now fully integrated, the rest 
of the items are pushed back again for the next iteration in order to get this 
release stabilized and tested

2007-09-11  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libdm/Makefile.am, src/libfb/Makefile.am:
	de-nest OPENGL from X11, configure now does the sanity checking

	* configure.ac:
	WITH_OPENGL actually means GLX, so don't enable if X is not enabled

	* bench/run.sh:
	setting a log variable confuses some shells (solaris /bin/sh) and kills 
the log function, so rename the var to lg

	* bench/run.sh: fix parsing bit that confused /bin/sh on solaris

2007-09-11  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libfft/ditsplit.c, src/libfft/ditsplitc.c, src/libfft/splitdit.c, 
src/libfft/splitditc.c, src/liboptical/photonmap.c:
	multiply as a double

2007-09-10  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libdm/Makefile.am, src/libfb/Makefile.am:

2007-09-10  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/beset/fitness.c:
	silly coder, this is C! you can't declare variables mid-scope

2007-09-10  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librtserver/Makefile.am:
	librtserver needs to be able to have all brl-cad symbols resolved, must 
use the not-installed-libraries for the LIBADD.  tcl will still fail if a 
suitable libtcl is not installed in a standard system search path (and it's too 
much of an unmaintainable pita to make a libtcl_nil).

2007-09-10  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/sig/dfft.c, src/sig/syn.c: remove the "complex.h" include

	* src/adrt/libtie/tie.c, src/adrt/libtie/tie_kdtree.c:
	wrap stdint.h (fix for solaris)

	* src/adrt/libtie/Makefile.am, src/adrt/libtie/tie.c, 
src/adrt/libtie/tie_kdtree.c:
	move to old C comments so we can remove the -std=c99 cflag

	* src/external/Makefile.am:
	include the sources in the dist, even if not built

2007-09-08  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/pad_file.xml.in: update the long description

	* doc/description.txt:
	update the full description section so it reads better, shorten the 
first paragraph, include history, and mention mike.  add a 2000-char long 
description section too.

2007-09-07  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	Oops! lost the prefix on the last commit. Now adds the optional prefix 
before
	building a unique name for the dbconcat command.

2007-09-07  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	john fixed a database corruption bug caused during dbconcat.  dbconcat 
command was not insuring unique names if neither the -s nor the -p options were 
used. Now adds suffix as needed (-s) by default. This fixed bug #1708349 
'database corruption in mged 7.8.4'. shibby sweet.

2007-09-06  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/mirror.c, NEWS:
	implement mirroring of BoT primitives, the code was just never written 
for that primitive.  this implements dwayne's sf request 1784787 (BOT 
primitives will not mirror).

	* NEWS, src/mged/edsol.c:
	report selected vertex/edge values using the current local coordinates 
instead of in millimeters when editing BoTs.  this fixes sf bug #1784781 
reported by dwayne as 'BOT units mm'

	* src/mged/edsol.c: good grief, tone down the exclamation marks

	* NEWS: improved photon map irradiance progress reporting

2007-09-04  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/liboptical/photonmap.c:
	Timer based progress report on irradiance cache if sigalrm is handy. 
Also tries to estimate how much time left. PR#1312281.

	* src/liboptical/photonmap.c:
	carry a_logoverlap so -R has the expected behavior when building the 
irradiance cache

	* src/librt/g_tgc.c:
	only print all that prep stuff if solid debugging is turned on

	* src/conv/jack/g-jack.c, src/conv/off/g-off.c:
	use literal terminator instead of casting null (fixes compiler warning)

	* src/remrt/rtsrv.c: commit to quell compiler warning

2007-09-04  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	once again, john continues to rock and rock hard he does with this 
latest addition -- tab-completion for mged.  he added tab bindings for both 
classic and tcl gui mode where the commands complete out and then during 
command processing, tab expands out to the available objects including down a 
geometry path.  this has been a long-desired, often-requested feature.  very 
awesome, even if it doesn't use readline/libedit. ;)

2007-09-03  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	openNURBS just released an update back at the end of July, schedule 
integrating/reviewing those changes

2007-09-02  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/ged.c, src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl, 
src/tclscripts/mged/tclIndex, src/tclscripts/mged/text.tcl:
	Added basic tab expansion by adding a binding for tab. Does not use 
readline
	library (would require massive rewrite of ged.c and text.tcl). This may 
be
	enough to satisfy the feature request for tab expansion.

2007-09-01  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	fixed various operability issues reported by flawfinder, predominantly 
related to quelling flawfinder warnings though some of the issues reported 
under specific input conditions could trigger bad application behavior 
including crashes, other instabilities, or outright potential security concerns.

2007-08-30  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h: protect the vararg func decl

	* src/Makefile.am, src/adrt/Makefile.am:
	since it's now integrated with the big M, always compile adrt's libtie 
regardless of adrt being disabled/enabled because of python/sdl (since libtie 
is generic).

	* NEWS:
	erik fixed a photon-mapping lighting model crash where it was trying to 
allocate zero bytes (which cases an intentional bomb)

2007-08-30  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/liboptical/photonmap.c:
	try not to bu_malloc() 0 bytes. Caused the lighting model to bomb...

	* src/librt/table.c: trimmed down oversized string

	* src/libbu/malloc.c: minor casting and default value (-Wall)

	* src/libbu/parallel.c:
	added missing header for fbsd. changed chmod() to fchmod() (flawfinder).

	* BUGS: dbconcat hangs on empty tree nodes

	* NEWS: reword for consistency

	* NEWS:
	Mged now tests for vim before vi for text editing, this implements sf 
feature request 1219084 (default editor vim instead of vi suggested)

	* src/mged/tedit.c:
	check for vim before looking for vi, add comments on order preference, 
and don't invoke xterm if we're IF_TK.  this fixes sf feature request 1219084 
(default editor vim instead of vi suggested)

2007-08-29  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS: Mac CPU detection stuff

	* src/libbu/parallel.c:
	Remove unnecessary __ppc__ test (use __APPLE__ to do both PPC and 
Intel).
	Get the number of available CPU's instead of present CPU's on a Mac.

	* src/libbu/parallel.c:
	Allow intel macs to see more than 2 from bu_avail_cpus().. PR#1784346

	* src/mk/mk_wire.1: this is mk_wire, not mk_handle. PR#1775606

	rtedge may have produced "plot" files in the past, but spits out pix 
images these days. PR#1779521

	* src/util/plstat.c:
	program name is plstat, not pldebug (in usage and perror output).

	* src/libbu/image.c: explicitely cast to keep osX happy

	* bench/Makefile.am, db/Makefile.am, src/conv/Makefile.am, 
src/util/Makefile.am, src/conv/comgeom/Makefile.am, src/sig/Makefile.am:
	DEPS updates

	* bench/Makefile.am: fix for "out of dir" builds

	coerce dfft to use bu_getopt instead of the big whileifelseifelseif 
construct

	* src/sig/Makefile.am: add DEPS line

2007-08-28  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	use AC_LANG_PUSH, AC_LANG_POP for going into/out of C++ testing mode

2007-08-27  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	This was not the fix for OpenBSD. Without it, OBSD4.1 seems to work 
just fine.

	* configure.ac: use the C++ compiler to test for the TNT/JAMA header

2007-08-25  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl, NEWS:
	make zclipping off by default now, causes more problems that provides 
benefits as you have to know that it's hiding geometry from you (so require 
users request this behavior (indicating they know it'll hide their data))

2007-08-24  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	The test for Tk failued for me on several platforms with no valid
	DISPLAY set (perhaps due to an X server running and just assuming
	unsetting display will do it? or perhaps tcl84, which worked...
	*shrug*). Changed the Tk_GetScrollInfo() to Tk_ParseArgv with the
	supporting framework and this seems to work consistantly for me.

2007-08-24  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_pipe.c:
	Rays parallel to the plane of a bend that missed the bend segment were 
producing error messaages from rt_poly_findroot(). Added a check for these 
misses in the bend segment shot routine (probably improves performance, too!!!).

2007-08-23  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_pipe.c:
	Eliminate linear sections that are too small to raytrace

2007-08-23  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BUGS, NEWS:
	john fixed the pipe bug where pipes with discontinuous changes in inner 
radii would result in bad segments.  while he was doing that, he added some 
space partitioning optimizations to speed them up some by using bounding boxes 
and spheres for the straight ends and bends respectively.

src/librt/view_obj.c:
	change behavior by 1.0e-77 or 1.0e-39 such that we now consistently 
check whether values are > or <= SMALL (or SMALL_FASTF) instead of just < in 
some places and > in others.  did not change the SQRT_SMALL_FASTFs (other than 
those via SMALL) just to make sure there are not any unexpected results with 
this batch first.  this should of course only tweak edge cases that are well 
within floating point fuss, but they should be all treated consistently 
regardless.

2007-08-21  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_pipe.c:
	Added a bounding box check to linear pipe segments.
	moved the bounding box/sphere checks into rt_pipe_shot()

	* src/librt/g_pipe.c:
	Added code to account for discontinuous changes in radius.
	Changed bend segments to use a bounding sphere (improved performance)

2007-08-19  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	improve the libtk functionality test with the help of ertugerata (thx!) 
so that it no longer uses Tk_Init() (which had the unfortunate side-effect of 
attempting to talk to an X11 server and wanting DISPLAY to be set).  instead, 
it now uses Tk_GetScrollInfo which basically just parses a number out of a 
string.

	update from libpng 1.2.16 to 1.2.19, picking up a handful of fixes.  
nothing too critical as far as I can tell, but does reportedly include a minor 
security fix and major bug fixes (going from freshmeat categories)

	* src/rt/Makefile.am, src/rt/hurt.c:
	add an experimental 'minimal' testing ray tracer based on rt that is 
just one file.  it's a humongous unified ray tracer (hurt) that shouldn't even 
be compiled by default.  presently weighs in at about 2k lines total (not 
including lib code) with huge portions of rt functionality ripped out.  again, 
this is just for experimental use only so don't expect anything to come of this.

	* src/rt/opt.c: meh

	* src/other/tcl/generic/tcl.h: quell HAVE_DECLSPEC warning

	* include/brlcad_version.h: quell unused warning

	* include/light.h, include/shadework.h:
	quell warning, ifdef instead of if rt_multispectral

	* src/rt/main.c:
	oops, remove the sigill signal handler vestige I was using for 
debugging.

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am, src/libfb/fb_generic.c,

src/libfb/if_wgl.c:
	remove the fblocal.h header file.  it was only used in three places 
(two files) and only contained one macro (wrapper to fb_log an error), so keep 
it simple until it's really needed.

	* src/libfb/if_disk.c:
	get rid of a memory chunk not being released until exit that doesn't 
need to be mallocated in the first place since it's a fixed size

	* NEWS, src/libbu/parallel.c, src/rt/main.c, src/rt/opt.c:
	allow the ray-tracers to use more than the available cpus for debugging 
and testing purposes.  this was previously only possible via compile-time 
modifications, but now is possible via the BU_DEBUG_PARALLEL debug flag (-\!10 
on most of the raytracers).

2007-08-17  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbn/poly.c:
	rework the quadratic root solver to handle some additional exceptional 
cases where either the coefficients or the discriminate are zero.  ideally we 
could presume we're solving equations that don't have floating point fuzz, and 
could check for for ieee zero equivalence but alas we cannot without causing 
additional instability.

	* src/librt/shoot.c:
	make sure there is a hit routine to call, otherwise it's a miss

	* NEWS, src/librt/g_rec.c:
	fixed a bug encountered when ray-tracing really tiny TGC objects 
(sub-millimeter size) caused by the REC prep routine thinking it was a valid 
right elliptical cone (when it wasn't).  the problem was due to a bad magnitude 
check and an insufficient hard-coded 'smallness' constant.  the result was rays 
that would miss portions of the tgc entirely, only counting the 'middle' 
portion that would have corresponded with an REC.

	* src/nirt/parse_fmt.c: comments and curlies

	* BUGS:
	nirt/query_ray reports intersection messages in triplicate if the shot 
routines miss but still print out messages

2007-08-16  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS, src/nirt/parse_fmt.c:
	increased output precision from nirt/query_ray to 8 digits after the 
decimal.  was previously 2 to 4 digits depending on the field, which was 
particularly detrimental for reproducing shots using the limited az el values 
or for seeing what floating point fuzz is relevant on the origin and shot 
direction.

	* TODO:
	put off opennurbs integration for now, still questionable whether it 
really needs to be integrated aside from being stagnated at the moment

	* NEWS, TODO, src/util/Makefile.am, src/util/op-bw.1, src/util/op-bw.c:
	remove the op-bw utility, an obsolete tool written to read images from 
an Optronics scanner into a bw.  tool can be removed when they are no longer in 
use and impose a burden to maintain. (sorry Phil)

	* TODO:
	lay out the next two release iterations (both probably still patch 
releases)

	* AUTHORS, NEWS:
	time to announce and credit beset, Ben's Evolutionary Shape Extraction 
Tool by Ben Poole

	* NEWS, README, TODO, include/conf/PATCH:
	post commit, bump the version numbers and plan for the next release 
(expecting another patch release)

2007-08-16  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/rt/view.c: list light model option in -h

2007-08-16  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS, TODO, include/conf/PATCH, ChangeLog:
	performing the 7.10.2 release, bump the revisions and tag it as 
rel-7-10-2

	* src/mged/points/points_scan.l:
	note that we could have used YY_NO_UNPUT instead of the hack

	* src/other/tk/unix/.cvsignore:
	ignore the generated tclstub export file

	* TODO:
	bezier extrusions need to be optimized, really should not be performing 
dynamic memory allocations in the root solver

	* src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	the number of light sample points needs to be considerably bigger than 
the number of shadow rays otherwise we end up with sample patterns in the 
shadow.

	* NEWS: support infinite # of shadow rays in the raytracers

	* src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	aha, finally realized what is going awry... since the samples were 
previously already allocated to the hard-coded max, the sample generator just 
used the slots as needed, keeping track of them with lt_pt_count as new ones 
were needed.  what that means, though, is that we need to ensure an allocation 
before ALL of the places that lt_pt_count is incremented since that is when we 
need/make a new point.  this (finally) fixes the crashes I was seeing when 
multiple shadow rays were requested and it actually makes sense why.  .. and 
now users can actually request ten thousand shadow rays if they really want it, 
and it'll actually work

	* HACKING:
	sweet blessed jeebus. don't have to update config_win.h any more since 
it seems to be pulling it from the builds system now.  I think daniel must be 
to thank for that goodness

	* HACKING:
	version numbers are no longer in configure.ac, they're in the version 
files in include/conf now

	* configure.ac:
	remove the old enable arg for proe since the with arg is used instead

2007-08-15  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/Makefile.am, configure.ac: removed vestigial crud

2007-08-15  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BUGS:
	john tracked down a quirky lil pipe bug where there can/should actually 
be 4 or 5 segments along a given ray when shooting through a pipe if/when the 
inner diameter of a bend is different from an adjoining straight section 
(causing a stair-step change in the pipe thickness).

	* NEWS: erik improved the anim_hardtrack manual page documentation

2007-08-14  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/anim/anim_hardtrack.1:
	Stub out missing options for PR 1773831. Someone with scary guru powers 
in anim should expand on it.

2007-08-11  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	there is just one IF_ per interface -- if you don't want the ogl 
interface, then don't define IF_OGL .. this has nothing to do with IF_WGL

2007-08-09  poolio  <poolio@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/beset/population.c: slight population modification

src/gtools/beset/beset.h, src/gtools/beset/fitness.c, 
src/gtools/beset/population.c:
	fitness now scales to union of bounding boxes. other slight 
modifications

2007-08-07  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	Several fixes for the Iwidgets test: link itcl, initialize tcl before 
itcl, and search the 'package names' even if the 'package require' claims to 
have failed (TK version issue caused require to report failure, but actually

	* src/gtools/beset/beset.c: documented -u and -l options

2007-08-02  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	remove the 'automatic flags' configure option (royal pita to keep track 
of cleanly in the configure logic for trivial gain) for now; rename the aquatk 
configure option to be consistent with the others and make it actually pass 
that on to tk's configure; and add a proper JavaVM framework check, using it 
instead of a platform test.

	* m4/restore.m4, configure.ac, m4/Makefile.am:
	autogen.sh no longer creates .backup files in an aux directory, so 
there's nothing for us to automatically recover from.  this means subsequent 
clobbering automakes may blow away our files, but there's not much we can do 
about it.

	* src/other/tk/Makefile.am, src/other/tcl/Makefile.am:
	more items that need to be uninstalled, added since a5 to a6

src/gtools/beset/population.h:
	working crossover and reproduction. implementation works, but is going 
to need a lot of tweaking.

2007-07-18  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp:
	make a note about the broken bezier clipping algorithm

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp:
	handle trim loop wrapping, i.e. need to close the loop

2007-07-17  poolio  <poolio@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/db_tree.c:
	db_count_tree_nodes() now counts nodes and leaves

2007-07-17  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/util/pl-X.c: cast to quell warning

2007-07-16  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp:
	match use of changed loop variable in body

2007-07-16  poolio  <poolio@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/beset/population.c:
	moved back from bu_external to rt_db_internal structs. removed now 
useless pop_dup_internal.

2007-07-16  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_curve.cpp:
	adapt some loop variables to not standard conform compilers
	added missing return statement

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp:
	adapt some loop variables to not standard conform compilers
	removed C99 code

	* include/config_win.h: undef small (was char)

2007-07-13  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs.h:
	quell my openNURBS debugging statements

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	mod subsurface bounding box calculations, i.e. sample more elements of 
the surface to try and include more points; expand bounding boxes a bit to 
overlap; expansion should be model size dependent (but it's not)

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	add more data for debugging and hit processing (i.e. label oob hits and 
record the subsurface bounding volume); add plotting routines for debugging 
shotlines graphically in MGED

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp: add note

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	tightened up the surface flatness (trying to solve the problem where 
bboxes don't fully enclose all points on their subsurface); expanded degenerate 
bboxes (i.e. for planar surfaces)

	* include/brep.h:
	Muck with tolerances a bit (they may not be the problem right now - i'm 
currently thinking its a trimming issue)

	* doc/brep.txt:
	Add a few more updates for things I thought of today; fix some wording

2007-07-13  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	WOO HOO... tkCanvasBezier, the custom Tk extension that has complicated 
matters for getting into apt, portage, fink, and more is now no longer needed.  
The sketch editor's bezier drawing code was rewritten to no longer use that 
canvas and instead just draw using ordinary Tk line segments, but evaluating 
the bezier curve directly just like the canvas was doing.  This was the last 
feature holding up release 7.10.2 so we're now on the green light for 
compilation and regression testing so that a release can be made.

2007-07-13  poolio  <poolio@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_curve.h, 
src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_system.h:
	include assert.h moved from opennurbs_curve.h to opennurbs_system.h

2007-07-12  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/skt_ed.tcl:
	reimplement bezier curve drawing for the sketch editor so that it no 
longer uses the tkCanvasBezier custom tk modification, instead just using 
simple tk line segment drawing, but sampling/evaluating the bezier as needed.  
code for calc_bezier was taken directly from the C code and is of course a bit 
slower since it's in tcl, but certainly fast enough for most purposes where the 
degree of the bezier curve is relatively low.  that should be pulled back to C 
land as an optimization down the road.  this change (finally) fully decouples 
the brl-cad build from needing access to private tk structures during 
compilation since the bezier canvas is no longer being used.

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs.h, 
src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_curve.h:
	include assert.h, thx louipc

2007-07-11  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/dg_obj.c:
	prevent 'inverted' min/max bounds from causing autoview to become 
-INFINITY or otherwise negative in size, this fixes bad behavior in mged where 
autoview of an empty sketch was causing bad view parameters.

2007-07-11  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp:
	add an "earlier" check for small clipping segments (value stolen from 
Stay's code)... haven't tested it yet

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	add support for plotting rays and intersection points to stdout during 
debug - see why we get the wrong thing! still can't see the individual points 
yet

	* include/plot3.h: add common.h; enable explicit C linkage

	* doc/brep.txt: couple more notes

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp: oops, fabs (not abs)

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp:
	make NumIntersections iterative instead of recursive; perform thirds 
split when split bounds get too close - may need to be adjusted to a different 
criterion later

	* doc/brep.txt:
	Initial BREP primitive document; contains info on concepts and 
development status of the primitive

2007-07-11  poolio  <poolio@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/beset/beset.c, src/gtools/beset/fitness.c,

	made sign() static

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/TclDummies.c: added NewDoubleObj and NewIntObj

2007-07-10  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	make all platforms use the same code for creating std in/out/err file 
channel handlers, using the newer Tcl_MakeFileChannel instead of 
Tcl_CreateFileHandler.  keep track of how many events we process for debugging.

	* NEWS, src/mged/cmd.c, src/mged/cmd.h:
	make 'bomb' an actual new command, passing through to bu_bomb().  very 
useful for debugging, tracing, and aborting from scripts abruptly.

	* src/libbu/backtrace.c:
	flush the output before sending the signal so that the parent should be 
guaranteed to have something to read.  this should hopefully fix a race 
condition where the child would never get the signal to continue.  fixed </> 
logic bug so we now actually wait a minute instead of immediately continuing.

	* src/libbu/bomb.c:
	make sure the string we're trying to print isn't null or empty, don't 
write the stacktrace message to the tty.

	* src/libbu/crashreport.c:
	capture stderr so that the kern.exec message is not displayed (on os x) 
during sysctl

	* configure.ac:
	if libstdc++ fails to link, see if it's because of libm (encountered by 
Laniakea on OpenBSD)

	* src/libbu/backtrace.c:
	hrm, for some reason the child isn't getting the signal so regardless, 
don't wait indefinitely for the child to send the signal.  only wait up to a 
minute for a debugger to attach.

2007-07-10  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/vrlink.c:
	rt_bufsize is in a header we don't use, so just define something

	* src/mged/vrlink.c: use bufsize instead

	* src/mged/vrlink.c:
	quell libpkg compilation warning, the buffer may be modified to add the 
pkg header so it shouldn't be const

	quell compilation warnings for a slew of switch statements that don't 
handle various possible enumeration values.  whether this is unimplemented 
functionality or cases that will never be encountered in that routine, the 
warnings can be quelled by adding a default case that does nothing.

	* src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	more cleanup, reorder based on call order, remove dead code, add 
comments

2007-07-09  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/liboptical/sh_light.c: general cleanup

2007-07-07  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/footer.sh:
	change default to // comments for C++ files, fix a bug related to 
having that as a comment character block when updating files that already have 
a footer too (encountered processing bzflag files)

	* sh/footer.sh:
	should use /usr/bin/env instead of assuming /bin/bash since it's not 
using /bin/sh

2007-07-05  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	include the configure flags in the summary report, remove surrounding 
whitespace on the FLAGS variables and only print them if they're not empty

	* src/libfft/Makefile.am:
	support convolution kernels up to 1024, but still only compile those up 
to 256 by default since optimization can be .. intense .. on the larger sizes

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_curve.cpp,

	flesh out implementation of CloseTo (generic curve version samples the 
curve and uses a binary search to try and find the closest point)

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:

something) to return the closes point)

2007-06-29  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

2007-06-29  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* m4/Makefile.am, m4/retry.m4:
	retry macros are no longer needed, the configure retry code was ripped 
out

	* configure.ac:
	finally rip out the retry code -- causes too many headaches and 
confusion when the retry also fails since it has the tendency to hide the 
original real problem.

	* src/gtools/beset/beset.c:
	remove the if, just make the EOF check part of the case

	* misc/brlcad-config.in:
	refactor the entire library processing so that it uses the exact same 
list that is used to compile from configure without maintaining a separate list 
in here.  add additional options for libdir, includedir, and ldflags too.  
still need to scan the FLAGS vars for automake vars

	* src/other/tk/Makefile.am:
	tk doesn't have a unix/dltest dir to prodclean

	* src/gtools/beset/beset.c:
	add support for librt -x debugging (e.g. -x 1 for rt_shootray() 
shotline debugging, see raytrace.h for debug flags)

2007-06-29  poolio  <poolio@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/dm.h, src/libdm/Makefile.am, src/libdm/focus.c:
	add a new dm_applicationfocus() call that will attempt to bring the 
invoked application to the current focus -- this is useful/interesting on Mac 
OS X where X11 applications are not focused by default when invoked via various 
means (e.g. double-clicking or via Terminal).

	* configure.ac:
	libdm actually presently uses librt, so make sure it's listed as a libs 
dependency.  add the carbon framework when we're on os x for the new 
application focus routine.

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	only try to use :0 if DISPLAY is not set.  if it's set and fails to 
load, that's user-intent.

	* BUGS:
	mged's plot tool (the gui one, not the 'plot' command) outputs a plot 
file that has an erase as the last command, causing empty plots

	* NEWS: pl-X functionality enhancements for displaying plots

	* src/util/Makefile.am:
	gah, did it again -- don't enable bombardier just yet, not being added 
until after the next release

	* configure.ac:
	check for -framework Carbon and the Carbon.h header so we can utilize 
Carbon framework API calls on Mac OS X, being used to bring X11.app to the 
focus automatically for X11 apps (useful for icon/script invocation and running 
from Terminal).

	* src/util/Makefile.am:
	link against the Carbon framework if we need to (on Mac OS X)

	* src/util/pl-X.c:
	use the HAVE_CARBON_CARBON_H symbol instead of __APPLE__ now

	* src/util/pl-X.c:
	big update/enhancements so that pl-X is actually functional and useful. 
 if the last command in a plot file is an erase command, don't do it (wth show 
a black window).  most importantly, keep the window up until the user presses a 
key.  additional goodness, if we're on Mac OS X, make sure X11 has focus.  
ignore newlines in the file for kicks.

	* src/util/pl-X.c:
	use 'fixed' font by default instead of the obscure 'vtsingle' font.. 
should really have a cmd-line option to set/override

style

2007-06-21  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_brep.cpp:
	adjust tolerance values in validity check - openNURBS was not using the 
values specified by the user (it was using hardcoded tolerances...) - this may 
need to be investigated further

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	fix another knot-related bug; remove debugging output; adjust flatness 
tolerance for small curves

2007-06-21  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	validate primitives during export so that it is guaranteed that illegal 
primitives will not be written to file; preserve an arb8 as an arb8 (instead of 
writing as arb6 or arb5) and similarly for the other arb# sizes

2007-06-21  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	make brep_hit a value object (no dynamic alloc); now dropping hit 
points if they don't fall within subsurface bbox; turned off bbox plotting

	* src/conv/iges/n_iges.hpp: turn off some debugging in the converter

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp:

needs to be looked at in more depth)

	* include/vector.h: move now takes a const pointer to the pt

2007-06-21  poolio  <poolio@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac, src/gtools/Makefile.am: updated build files for beset

	* src/gtools/beset/Makefile.am, src/gtools/beset/beset.c:
	added build files and test program

2007-06-21  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BUGS:
	more bugs from dwayne's issues sheet including the return of the 
annoying cursor box character capture.  also note BoT editing bug (units always 
mm), overlap tool inefficiency, and snap-to-grid issues.

	* BUGS:
	annotate a couple of the bugs that dwayne reported regarding facedef 
and permute not coordinating with the display properly

2007-06-21  poolio  <poolio@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/beset/fitness.c, src/gtools/beset/fitness.h:
	modularized fitness functions

	* src/gtools/beset/fitness.c:
	moved global vars to fstate and general cleanup

	* src/gtools/beset/fitness.c:

partition

2007-06-20  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp:
	fixed (? maybe) the bezier clipping algorithm infinite recursion when 
the clip is too large

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	fixed bug in bounding box generation: wasn't capturing true dimensions, 
now using openNURBS BB routine for initial calc; some more debugging stmts

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	added bounding-box plotting for debugging purposes; fixed memory leak
	in shot routine; debugging acne/odd hit count problems (currently not
	finished!!); renamed existing debug statements (should just remove 
them!)

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	move the debugging defines into one place; implement correct ON_Ray 
copy ctor/asst operator; fix node intersection

2007-06-20  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	if we're building with cygwin, tk wants access to headers in the tk/win 
directory, so add it to the cppflags header search paths

2007-06-20  poolio  <poolio@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/beset/fitness.c:
	initial base for _beset_: ben's evolutionary shape extraction tool

	* doc/cvs.txt: CVS moved from cvs.sf.net to brlcad.cvs.sf.net

2007-06-19  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp:
	debug and fix bezier clipping (case c) - still needs to be cleaned up 
and more fully debugged

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	fix plot routine to now show edge curves better (still needs 
refinement, e.g. dynamic sampling)

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp:
	fix arc generation bug: openNURBS does not interpret "wrapping" angles

2007-06-19  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h, src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	VC++ 6.0 adaptions: missing return statement, parent class, etc.

	* include/config_win.h: redefine min and max in C++ environment

2007-06-18  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	pass output file on command line and remove hard-coded output file

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp, src/conv/iges/brlcad.hpp:
	remove hard-coded output filename

2007-06-18  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	john fixed a g_diff bug where -f option missed differences -- now only 
calls atof the values actually seem to be numbers.

	* src/tclscripts/helplib.tcl: can get/set with units command

	* NEWS, TODO:
	john fixed the units command, woot.  it was an issue with 
interp->result being used where apparently it was an object instead of a 
string.  this apparently only now biting us, probably due to the 8.5 upgrade, 
though tcl.h says to stop using it since 8.0

2007-06-18  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/g2asc.c, src/libbn/bn_tcl.c, src/libtclcad/tclcadAutoPath.c, 
src/mged/vrlink.c, src/util/pl-dm.c, src/bwish/input.c, src/bwish/main.c:
	Eliminated more instances of direct access of interp->result (not 
allowed
	since tcl 8.0)

	* src/gtools/g_diff.c:
	Added calls to wdb_create_command() since it had been removed from 
wdb_obj_init().
	Also fixed a small bug where -f option would miss differences.

2007-06-16  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/edsol.c, src/mged/ged.c, src/mged/grid.c, src/mged/setup.c, 
src/mged/vrlink.c, src/mged/chgmodel.c, src/mged/chgview.c, src/mged/cmd.c:
	Eliminated direct access of interp->result (Not reliable since tcl 8.0).
	See the comment in tcl.h.
	This also fixes the "units" command.

2007-06-16  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/attach.c:
	jeebus, why in the world is a vls being used for a constant string..

2007-06-15  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_ehy.c: it's an elliptical hyperboloid

	* TODO:
	units command doesn't seem to be working, must be fixed before release

	* db/Makefile.am, db/operators.asc:
	add operators.asc which is an example of CSG operators in action, 
inspired from a similar image from Waterloo's cs488 course on interactive 
ray-tracing of CSG

	* src/conv/g2asc.c: make sure attributes don't have empty names

2007-06-15  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	Debugging the nurbs curve generation after pullback curve 
interpolation... I'm not quite sure WTF openNURBS is doing... Curves are being 
generated now, but the trimming code is failing for some reason.

2007-06-14  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_curve.h:
	NumIntersectionsWith now virtual (duh)

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp:
	fixed convex hull handling and finished case C implementation (not 
debugged yet)

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	many bug fixes (openNURBS knot vector problem again...) lots of debug 
statements. adjusted flatness criterion to be a scale of the curve length.

	* src/conv/iges/nmain.cpp:
	add a cheesy file parameter to converter (remove hard-coded 
filename)... needs to be fleshed out better

	* src/conv/iges/n_iges.hpp:
	fix circular arc handler method to take a normal

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp:
	to avoid trying to build a plane from a line, pass the origin and a 
normal instead

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad.hpp:
	alter the arc handle method to take a pre-calculated normal

	* src/conv/iges/BrepHandler.cpp:
	When an arc's start center and end points are coplanar, we can't find 
the plane! so calculate the normal and pass it through to the handler...

2007-06-13  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp:
	Flesh out Bezier intersection counting... not done with case c yet

2007-06-12  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	Change brep_pt_trimmed to use NumIntersectionsWith() method in 
openNURBS. will make the unfinished brep_count_intersections() function 
obsolete...

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_bezier.cpp,

	Add implemention of and support for NumIntersectionsWith(ON_Line)... 
all in support for trimming curve tests

2007-06-11  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	jason feels it's probably best to make mods to openNURBS itself now in 
order to fully integrate/complete the brep implementation and given his 
implementation uses libbu and libbn extensively, this move will make openNURBS 
similarly dependent.  thus, the intent is to then to effectively fork openNURBS 
and make it a noinst brl-cad sub-library (either in librt or up a level) for 
obtaining brep support.

	* bench/benchmark.1:
	improve documentation, include the OPTIONS and command in the synopsis 
as well as a whole new section with some examples.  initial revision was in 
1988.

	* TODO:
	all the docs should now be in the docs section, pix-png output was 
fixed to check for console output

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	remove the disable the call to Tcl_DeleteInterp for release since there 
seems to be some reference counting issues in a6, remvoe the 
bu_semaphore_release call too as release pairs with acquire, not with init 
(there is presently no free routine that pairs with init)

2007-06-06  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp: missing required header (assert.h)

2007-06-06  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	Add delegate implementations of depth and getLeaves for SurfaceTree

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	Finish implementation of preprocess_trims, start implementation on trim 
support methods (count_intersections), since openNURBS leaves the curve 
intersection routines unimplemented

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	Implement getLeaves and depth support on SurfaceTree for trim 
preprocessing

2007-06-06  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	evaluate HAVE_DRAND48 before calling drand48

	* include/config_win.h: proper for-scope in MSVC 6.0

	* include/plot3.h:
	one more consistency cleanup (__ in header protection of vmath.h)

	* src/librt/librt.dsp: Add opennurbs_ext functionality to librt

2007-06-05  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	Add some additional debug statements for testing pullback_curve behavior

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	Fix brep plot() problem with non-trivial faces (i.e. those coming from 
IGES), perform simplified edge rendering (still needs to be fleshed out to 
handle non-linear curves)

	* src/conv/iges/n_iges.cpp:
	Fix IGES string->double conversion bugs (duh)

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp:
	Add more debug statements... fix trim curve orientation issue 
(openNURBS trims must be properly oriented whether or not the model-space curve 
is) and fix isoparametric flag issue

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	debug to stdout instead of error (easier to log everything together)

2007-06-05  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BUGS:
	dsp primitive is going into what seems to be an unbounded memory 
allocation loop inside dsp_layers during prep, reported by yukonbob (thx)

2007-06-04  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h, src/conv/iges/BrepHandler.cpp, 
src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp, src/conv/iges/nmain.cpp, src/librt/g_brep.cpp, 
src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	Debug IGES parsing/handling and openNURBS extensions. Still not 
building a simple B-Rep correctly (trim vertices not agreeing)

	* src/conv/iges/Makefile.am:
	Remove the standalone pullback curve impl from compilation (need to 
delete files later)

2007-06-04  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_system.h:
	don't need SUNOS now that he found the right one

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_point.cpp:
	use common.h so it can work on non-configure platforms too

2007-06-03  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* regress/moss.sh: fix call to pixdiff and ws

	* src/librt/db_open.c: don't dereference null if we're failing early

	* regress/Makefile.am, regress/gqa.sh, regress/spdi.sh, 
regress/weight.sh:
	move more of the mged scripts to their own files so that segfault 
failures on linux are more brief.

	* regress/solids.sh: remove solids.mged

	* regress/Makefile.am: clean up after solids and shaders

	* regress/shaders.sh:
	use a shaders.mged transcript so that error reports are more concise

	* regress/gqa.sh, regress/iges.sh, regress/lights.sh, regress/moss.sh, 
regress/shaders.sh, regress/spdi.sh, regress/weight.sh:
	set the ld_library_path so the binaries invoked by the test can find 
the tcl/tk libraries.

	* regress/Makefile.am: mged_solids.log is no longer generated

	* regress/solids.sh:
	set the ld_library_path so the binaries invoked by the test can find 
the tcl/tk libraries.  also, write out the mged script to a file so that errors 
don't dump the entire script.  use solids.log for the log.

	* src/other/tk/unix/tcl.m4:
	if we're on freebsd, there should be no reason why we can't just use 
gcc instead of ld -- this allows 'lib' flags being provided for XFT_LIBS via 
xft-config to actually not break the build.

	* src/util/Makefile.am: missing trailing slash

	* src/libbu/bomb.c:
	add comment docs on bu_bomb usage and add name given extensive changes 
over time.

	* src/libbu/semaphore.c:
	should be fine to use bu_bomb instead of abort as bu_bomb should not 
attempt to acquire a semaphore (it doesn't use bu_log).

2007-06-02  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/conf/Makefile.am:

2007-06-01  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	Add some debugging output. Getting periodic divergence in root finder 
(still don't know why).

	* src/conv/iges/n_iges.hpp: Remove broken index macros

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp:
	Use recommended (by openNURBS) method of accessing topology using 
indices instead of references/pointers. Also fix nurbssurface storage into 
opennurbs data structures (knots handled differently)

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad.hpp:
	Use recommended (by openNURBS) method of accessing topology using 
indices instead of references/pointers

	* src/conv/iges/BrepHandler.cpp:
	Fix bug in IGES nurbs extraction (index calculation errors)

2007-06-01  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/conf/Makefile.am:
	return to simplicity, doesn't matter what is in the srcdir

2007-06-01  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/tcl/generic/regex.h:
	add in the #include "./tclInt.h" that was lost during upgrade (fixes 
the regex issues in librt/regionfix.c and conv/proe-g.c)

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_point.cpp:
	since brlcad_config.h isn't being pulled in from an included header, 
include it explicitely for the HAVE_IEEEFP_H cpp symbol

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_system.h:
	fix for solaris/gcc (SUNOS is not defined, but __sun is)

2007-05-31  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/conf/Makefile.am: quote the expr so it doesn't error out

	* src/other/jove/jove-tutorial, doc/description.txt, doc/mged.tr:
	minor nitpick, it was the Ballistic Reseach Lab.

	* src/fbed/loadfont.c: comment cleanup

	* include/Makefile.am: need opennurbs_ext.h in the dist

	* include/conf/Makefile.am:
	attempt yet again, don't use cp since it will complain about identical 
files -- use the kitten.

2007-05-31  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	Fix parameter passing, and integrate surfacetree through pullback_curve 
function

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	Move vector point/matrix functions to vector.h. Fix some 
pointer/reference passing issues.

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp:
	Simplify call to pullback_curve during testing

	* include/vector.h:
	Move vector point/matrix functionality here from g_brep.cpp

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs.h, 
src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_system.h:
	opennurbs_system.h has compiler checks for alloca and inclusion of 
alloca -- just needs another for sun.  not as robust as the lengths autoconf 
suggests, but then neither is using our brlcad_config.h in a public header.  
need to retest on sun/irix to see if the ON_COMPILER_IRIX and ON_COMPILER_SUN 
work (else tweak the defines).

non-sse archs

2007-05-31  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/conf/Makefile.am:
	rework the configuration files so that they will work even if they pull 
read-only files from top_srcdir (e.g. during a distcheck on some platforms).

	* configure.ac:
	another big aliasing restructure for consistency.  includes removing 
some of the more gratuitous/verbose aliases as well as more consistently using 
-install for the three (iwidgets, tnt, models) that aren't actually 'compiled'. 
 should match the new INSTALL docs.

	* INSTALL:
	kaboom! .. document all of the configure options we provide (both the

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h, src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	Add closestPointEstimate support to bounding volumes

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp: Make root node access const

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp: Remove commented code

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	Fix bugs (no inlining for intersection method, make root bv access 
const)

2007-05-30  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h: change image format #define stuff to an enum

2007-05-29  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_math.cpp, 
src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_math.h:
	ws change and remove inline modifier (fix linking problems :-)

	* src/other/openNURBS/brlcad_surfacetree.cpp, 
src/other/openNURBS/brlcad_surfacetree.h:
	Fix the storage of faces instead of just surfaces (more information)

	* src/other/openNURBS/Makefile.am:
	Remove the compilation of the opennurbs-proper extensions (too many 
dependencies to resolve for now)

	* src/librt/opennurbs_ext.cpp:
	Initial implementation of opennurbs_ext features (closest point is not 
implemented yet)

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	Replace primitive-only bounding volume hierarchy with opennurbs_ext 
surface tree. Will remove commented code later.

	* src/librt/Makefile.am: Add opennurbs_ext functionality to librt

	* src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp: Remove the old pullback curve header

	* include/opennurbs_ext.h:
	Add some "extensions" to opennurbs (currently residing in librt) to 
support pullback curves and closest point functionality

	* include/brep.h:
	Switch in support for new opennurb_ext bounding volumes (still in 
development)

2007-05-27  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/parallel.c: it's an array of ints, so sizeof accordingly

	* bench/benchmark.1, bench/run.sh:
	differentiate between clean and clobber, allowing clean to remove files 
without being prompted while clobber also deletes the (new) benchmark.log files 
(but still not the summary file)

	* NEWS: benchmark tool automatically logs all output to file

	* bench/benchmark.1, bench/run.sh:
	add support for automatic logging of benchmark results to a file.  this 
is so users don't have to rerun and/or manually capture output if they want to 
review the output in detail.  also included is the date/time and uname of the 
system running the analysis.  make the file path searching output verbose-only 
now.  docs updated to reflect all these changes.

	* autogen.sh: oops, one char typo -- try again

	* bench/run.sh: use VERBOSE_ECHO instead of testing DEBUG

	* autogen.sh, bench/run.sh:
	gnu sed apparently doesn't read from stdin, so make a custom test for 
it.

2007-05-26  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO: investigate/fix db_walk_dispather crash in rt

	* bench/run.sh:
	saying 'this' sounds quirky when running through make, use pwd instead

	* autogen.sh: search for sed and pwd

	* src/librt/roots.c:
	FAST and LOCAL are no longer really useful, adding more burden than 
they provide, so begin a move towards deprecation.

	* src/libdm/dm-tk.c: credit tim, ws

	* AUTHORS:
	bonomo's last name first, credit tim for his extensive tk interface 
contributions

	* src/libfb/if_tk.c:
	libfb interface files are conditionally empty, so add the appropriate 
IF_TK protection

	* configure.ac:
	force the tk interface off for now, there are still many issues to 
resolve -- particularly crashes under os x

	* NEWS: added 'clobber' cleanup command to benchmark tool

	* bench/Makefile.am:
	build system no longer needs to know or care -- delegate cleanup to the 
benchmark tool directly

	* bench/run.sh:
	add support for a clobber command argument so the benchmark tool can 
clean up after itself no matter where it's run from

	* bench/run.sh:
	add sanity checks for commands that are required, add ability to quell 
output entirely via QUIET and verbosely with VERBOSE.

	* Makefile.am, bench/Makefile.am:
	delegate benchmark rules down to the bench dir so they're only in one 
place (and so files aren't generated in the top-level), mirroring what regress 
does.  inform the user when benchmark completes about the clobber rule.

	* src/libbu/bomb.c:
	move the variables off the stack, making them static globals, just to 
be more safe.  Also, be more assertive about informing the user that a stack 
trace has been saved (since mged captures std output).

	* src/librt/bigE.c: minor header cleanup

	* include/plot3.h, include/raytrace.h: more consistency cleanup

	* include/rtgeom.h: missed the endif

	* src/mged/ged.h:
	don't declare the same thing that the public header declares for us

	* include/rtgeom.h, include/solid.h, include/spm.h, include/vmath.h,

include/raytrace.h, include/config_win.h, include/db.h, include/db5.h, 
include/dm-Null.h, include/dm-glx.h, include/bn.h, include/conf.h:
	clean up the header protections so that they are all now more 
consistent with one another via use of __HEADER_H__ for the define names.

	* TODO, include/shortvect-pr.h, include/shortvect.h:
	shortvect.h and shortvect-pr.h are both rather obsolete headers -- mark 
them as such with a #warning and make a note to remove them.  if we're ever 
compiling on a cray again and need those features, they more appropriately 
belong in the config header.

	* include/common.h, include/compat4.h, include/db.h, include/db5.h,

include/wdb.h, include/bu.h, include/bn.h, include/brep.h, include/brlcad.h:
	get rid of RCS variables from the public header files.  this is done in 
part to reduce recompilation during interface changes, but also to move towards 
not relying on or publishing the information contained in the variables 
interface-wise. (they're fine for c sources and private headers)

	* src/libbu/backtrace.c:
	utilize BU_DEBUG_ATTACH to allow for run-time attaching a debugger to 
apps that will potentially crash.  this sends the app looping until a signal is 
received, or a variable is manually set in the debugger.

	* include/bu.h:
	add BU_DEBUG_ATTACH for the backtrace crash dump routines as a means 
for them to spin and wait for a debugger to attach.

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	db_get_version() was intentionally getting passed a partially 
initialized dbip -- require it be initialized before we pass it around 
anywywhere.  clean up during failure cleanup on db_open() while we're at it.

2007-05-25  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/mged.tcl: quotes, and update comment

	* src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl: quotes

	* src/librt/db5_scan.c:
	return quietly if dbip is null or if the file pointer isn't set, plus 
some ws

	* src/librt/db_open.c: ws

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	condense the windows section, using the 'b' mode identifier is fine on 
non-_WIN32 platforms (c90 defines it to do nothing)

	* configure.ac: check for sync for db_sync()

	* src/librt/db5_scan.c:
	quietly return -1 if given null or there is no file pointer opened

	* src/conv/g-dxf.c:
	extensively improve the g-dxf usage statement, add options, add version 
info

	* include/brlcad_version.h:
	fix horrible, horrible oversight typo that prevents brlcad_version() 
from working

	* TODO:
	auto_path tcl initialization startup code was once again re-written and 
verified via valgrind.  this should fix a crash (that I don't have ready access 
to) reported via irc on a debian platform.

	* configure.ac:
	fix anonymous report of configure failure on 7.10.0 where turning off 
urt would result in a configure failure.  the problem was a variety of checks 
for configure settings that checked for the wrong value (!no instead of !yes, 
where default is "auto"). so the default worked, but not when the 3rd party lib 
was disabled.

	* src/libbu/semaphore.c:
	fix raytrace synchronization bug introduced via valgrinding.  release 
pairs up with acquire, not init.  need some other (new) routine to release the 
memory allocated during init and probably some atexit() handler to free that 
memory.

	* TODO: progress status during raytrace

2007-05-24  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	enhance dxf-g to create more than just one combination per layer

2007-05-24  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/Makefile.am, 
src/other/openNURBS/brlcad_surfacetree.cpp, 
src/other/openNURBS/brlcad_surfacetree.h:
	Sketch out skeleton surfacetree implementation and add to opennurbs 
build

	* src/other/openNURBS/brlcad_boundingvolume.h:
	Implement intersection routines

	* src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_math.cpp, 
src/other/openNURBS/opennurbs_math.h:
	Add simple near_zero function

2007-05-22  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/openNURBS/Makefile.am:
	add files to build bounding volume code (in development)

	* src/conv/iges/PullbackCurve.cpp, src/conv/iges/brlcad_brep.cpp:
	add debugging output and modify to call new pullback_curve routine. 
discovered openNURBS does not implement GetClosestPoint!!!

	* src/other/openNURBS/brlcad_boundingvolume.cpp, 
src/other/openNURBS/brlcad_surfacetree.h, 
src/other/openNURBS/brlcad_boundingvolume.h:
	new bounding volume support for opennurbs (part of closestPoint impl)

2007-05-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/util/remapid.c: s/ -> /->/

	* src/external/Cubit/Makefile.am:
	example build rules to make compile a test program

2007-05-21  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/geometree/Makefile.am, src/tclscripts/lib/Makefile.am,

src/tclscripts/swidgets/scripts/Makefile.am, src/tclscripts/util/Makefile.am, 
db/Makefile.am, src/tclscripts/Makefile.am, src/tclscripts/archer/Makefile.am:
	since tcl/tk are being compiled dynamic now instead of static and 
because they're not libtool libraries, libtool fails to find their uninstalled 
.so/.dylib files in src/other, and the wrapper script over binaries fails to 
search the provided -L paths.  so here we manually set LD/DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH 
before attempting to invoke the (uninstalled) binary during the compilation 
process.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/tclIndex: unix and drawDataAxes added

	* src/tclscripts/archer/tclIndex:
	apparently attr and make_name were added

	* src/libbu/semaphore.c: free the semaphore structures we allocated

	* src/util/pix-png.c:
	release allocated resources, clean valgrind report

2007-05-20  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	ack, pass mged_global_variable_teardown a freaking interpreter.  
release our semaphores too.

	* src/mged/cmd.c, src/mged/ged.c:
	unlink the variables we link on shutdown so we can clean up memory tcl 
allocated for managing them.  delete the tcl interpreter on shutdown too.

	* src/mged/ged.c: free allocated memory for cmd_list vls

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	plug a leak valgrind detected, free the searched vls in root/data 
routines.

	* src/libtclcad/tclcadAutoPath.c:
	massive refactoring of the src path handling including avoiding the 
dynamic atexit memory fugliness.  improve the actual searching for a src dir to 
not require allocations.  actually only check for init.tcl/tk.tcl one now.  
make the entire routine more cross-platform, using BU_DIR_SEPARATOR and 
BU_PATH_SEPARATOR respectively when building up and searching for paths.

	* src/libbu/whereis.c, src/libbu/which.c:
	clean up debug to indicate the function name, remove the latter 
checking statement (since bu_file_exists has its own)

	* include/bu.h:
	declare bu_argv0_full_path() and remove the bu_argv0() argument

	* src/libbu/backtrace.c, src/libbu/crashreport.c, src/mged/tedit.c, 
src/bwish/tcl.c:
	change bu_argv0() to not take any parameters, preferring instead that 
apps only use bu_setprogname(), passing the full argv[0].

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	revamp the implementation of most path-finding routines, and add a new 
bu_argv0_full_path() routine for determining the full-path to the current 
executing binary.  remove the atexit memory handler, instead using static 
buffers.  give bu_ipwd() one more means to determine the current path (via 
invoking pwd).

	* Makefile.am, bench/Makefile.am:
	even more specific, to be sure we only delete benchmark files by 
iterating over each test.

2007-05-19  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/prep.c:
	if a raytrace instance isn't being provided, we can/could presume that 
cleaning up after the directories is okay.  all of these issues stem from the 
two bu_ptbl_init() calls that do actually allocate memory (for the table).  
leave the freeing uncommited for now, just with comments

	* src/librt/wdb.c: doxy

	* src/conv/asc2g.c:
	call Tcl_Exit() instead of exit() so that tcl can attempt to recover 
and cleanup resource prior to shutdown -- alas, tcl doesn't clean up properly, 
but using Tcl_Exit is at least sufficient according to the docs.

	* src/librt/prep.c: comment that bu_ptbl_init does indeed allocate  :-/

	* src/librt/db5_io.c:
	plug a memory leak in asc2g, identified via valgrind, whereby an AVS 
was getting clobbered shortly after being initialized.  simply needed to 
initialize it without allocating.

	* bench/Makefile.am, Makefile.am:
	be even more specific on clobber file patterns

	* src/librt/cut.c, src/librt/db5_alloc.c, src/librt/db5_bin.c,

src/librt/nmg_mod.c, src/librt/nmg_rt_segs.c, src/librt/nurb_interp.c, 
src/librt/pmalloc.c, src/librt/bool.c:
	welcome to 1990, replace calls to bcopy with memcpy.  interestingly 
enough, valgrind on amd64 linux is showing bcopy() reading more than len bytes 
(reading to aligned memory internally)

	* Makefile.am, bench/Makefile.am: tick tock, 5 secs, boom.

	* Makefile.am:
	the benchmark itself needs to know how to clean up after itself, but go 
ahead and add the same support for 'make clobber' to delete the plethora of log 
and pixfiles generated after a run

	* bench/Makefile.am: clobber is phony

	* src/librt/db5_io.c:
	rewrite the attribute serialization -- valgrind was reporting invalid 
memory reads in the bcopy, past what should be valid.  new version uses memcpy 
and takes extra effort to handle null avs names/values.

	* src/librt/db5_scan.c: meh

	* src/librt/wdb.c: sanity nulls

	* src/librt/db_open.c: differentiate allocation

	* include/bu.h, include/fb.h, include/fbio.h, include/nmg.h, 
include/pkg.h, include/tclcad.h:
	don't force USE_PROTOTYPES to be necessarily set to get what we usually 
want anyways (i.e. proper decls with args) -- check for __STDC__ too to 
determine how to declare.

	* include/bn.h: remove dead macros (already marked for deprecation)

	* include/vmath.h: bb comment for searching

	* include/bu.h:
	okay to assume c89, remove some of the compat decls for older compilers

	* include/raytrace.h:
	remove dead decls (#if 0'd).  remove obsolete compat macros (also #if 
0'd).  the decls mostly use private structures, which means they shouldn't be 
in the public interface (i.e. this file) regardless.

	* src/conv/asc2g.c: ws

	* src/libbu/avs.c:
	first stab at fixing a memory leak on attribute names -- appears to be 
during a merge, where adding to an existing doesn't free the existing name 
(when a new one is provided).  clean up the avs printing summary and doxygen 
comments too.

	* src/librt/db5_io.c: free the avs if we're cutting out early

	* TODO: refactor complex.h and plane.h

	* src/conv/iges/PullbackCurve.cpp:
	convert use of vector to TNT arrays. implement control point generation 
using JAMA's LU decomposition.

	* src/conv/iges/PullbackCurve.cpp:
	implement b-spline interpolation: generating knots and parameters. next 
up: generating the control points.

	add the NIST template numerics toolkit (TNT) for more involved matrix 
manipulations that libbn doesn't cover.  TNT is a replacement for LAPACK++.  
Said matrix manipulations are needed for BREP manipulation.

	* autogen.sh:
	fix a bug where an automake failure after a libtool failure resulted in 
silent termination instead of showing the automake error.

	* src/libbn/poly.c, src/librt/roots.c: ws

bn_poly_synthetic_division() will too

	* src/librt/roots.c:
	gah, unbreak the root solver -- compat4 params are swapped like the 
others, just in a pair.  thx john!

	* src/libbu/bomb.c:
	instead of just dumping the backtrace, dump a full crash report .. but 
only do this if DEBUG is defined so we have a better chance at having debug 
symbols in the stack trace.

	* src/libbu/crashreport.c:
	comment that we really should fork and exec instead of use popen so we 
can close/redirect stderr since sysctl frequently will dump junk there.

	* src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	aha, finally realized what is going awry... since the samples were
previously already allocated to the hard-coded max, the sample generator just
used the slots as needed, keeping track of them with lt_pt_count as new ones
were needed.  what that means, though, is that we need to ensure an allocation
before ALL of the places that lt_pt_count is incremented since that is when we
need/make a new point.  this (finally) fixes the crashes I was seeing when
multiple shadow rays were requested and it actually makes sense why.  .. and
now users can actually request ten thousand shadow rays if they really want it,
and it'll actually work

	* TODO:
	WOO HOO... tkCanvasBezier, the custom Tk extension that has complicated
matters for getting into apt, portage, fink, and more is now no longer needed.
The sketch editor's bezier drawing code was rewritten to no longer use that
canvas and instead just draw using ordinary Tk line segments, but evaluating
the bezier curve directly just like the canvas was doing.  This was the last
feature holding up release 7.10.2 so we're now on the green light for
compilation and regression testing so that a release can be made.

	* src/tclscripts/mged/skt_ed.tcl:
	reimplement bezier curve drawing for the sketch editor so that it no
longer uses the tkCanvasBezier custom tk modification, instead just using
simple tk line segment drawing, but sampling/evaluating the bezier as needed.
code for calc_bezier was taken directly from the C code and is of course a bit
slower since it's in tcl, but certainly fast enough for most purposes where the
degree of the bezier curve is relatively low.  that should be pulled back to C
land as an optimization down the road.  this change (finally) fully decouples
the brl-cad build from needing access to private tk structures during
compilation since the bezier canvas is no longer being used.

cleaning up after the directories is okay.  all of these issues stem from the
two bu_ptbl_init() calls that do actually allocate memory (for the table).
leave the freeing uncommited for now, just with comments

	* src/librt/wdb.c: doxy

	* src/conv/asc2g.c:
	call Tcl_Exit() instead of exit() so that tcl can attempt to recover
and cleanup resource prior to shutdown -- alas, tcl doesn't clean up properly,
but using Tcl_Exit is at least sufficient according to the docs.

	* src/librt/prep.c: comment that bu_ptbl_init does indeed allocate  :-/

	* src/librt/db5_io.c:
	plug a memory leak in asc2g, identified via valgrind, whereby an AVS
was getting clobbered shortly after being initialized.  simply needed to
initialize it without allocating.

	* bench/Makefile.am, Makefile.am:
	be even more specific on clobber file patterns

	* src/librt/cut.c, src/librt/db5_alloc.c, src/librt/db5_bin.c,

src/librt/nmg_mod.c, src/librt/nmg_rt_segs.c, src/librt/nurb_interp.c,
src/librt/pmalloc.c, src/librt/bool.c:
	welcome to 1990, replace calls to bcopy with memcpy.  interestingly
enough, valgrind on amd64 linux is showing bcopy() reading more than len bytes
(reading to aligned memory internally)

	* Makefile.am, bench/Makefile.am: tick tock, 5 secs, boom.

	* Makefile.am:
	the benchmark itself needs to know how to clean up after itself, but go
ahead and add the same support for 'make clobber' to delete the plethora of log
and pixfiles generated after a run

	* bench/Makefile.am: clobber is phony

	* src/librt/db5_io.c:
	rewrite the attribute serialization -- valgrind was reporting invalid
memory reads in the bcopy, past what should be valid.  new version uses memcpy
and takes extra effort to handle null avs names/values.

	* src/librt/db5_scan.c: meh

	* src/librt/wdb.c: sanity nulls

	* src/librt/db_open.c: differentiate allocation

	* include/bu.h, include/fb.h, include/fbio.h, include/nmg.h,
include/pkg.h, include/tclcad.h:
	don't force USE_PROTOTYPES to be necessarily set to get what we usually
want anyways (i.e. proper decls with args) -- check for __STDC__ too to
determine how to declare.

	* include/bn.h: remove dead macros (already marked for deprecation)

	* include/vmath.h: bb comment for searching

	* include/bu.h:
	okay to assume c89, remove some of the compat decls for older compilers

	* include/raytrace.h:
	remove dead decls (#if 0'd).  remove obsolete compat macros (also #if
0'd).  the decls mostly use private structures, which means they shouldn't be
in the public interface (i.e. this file) regardless.

during a merge, where adding to an existing doesn't free the existing name

comments too.

	* src/librt/db5_io.c: free the avs if we're cutting out early

	gah, pick up where someone left off over half a decade ago.  finish
updating all of the compat4 symbols throughout the code to their new names.
finally. it's done.  make the deprecated headers obsolete -- make compat4.h
obsolete too so we can be sure that all of the changes are now picked up by the
compiler as errors.  this change will likely impact muves if they've similarly
not updated to the new names too, so the headers are kept with a #warning for
now (though will likely disappear down the road entirely).

allocation.

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c: minor, set to null when freed

	add a memory buffer failsafe to bu_bomb() that will release an
allocation (64k) prior to performing the shutdown calls (some syscalls, some
others may have tiny allocations of their own even for string/print

	* src/conv/iges/n_iges.cpp, src/conv/iges/n_iges.hpp,
src/conv/iges/nmain.cpp:
	Initial work on new IGES converter to support opennurbs breps. Old
converter is quite intertwined with existing BRL-CAD NMG/NURBS code... seemed a
bit cleaner to refactor things somewhat. Currently reads start, global and
directory sections correctly. Just started work on BREP entity parsing.

	initial brlcad-config script template that, similar to pkg-config, can
report on various cflags/cppflags and libs/ldflags for 3rd-party developers to
use for linking against brl-cad's various libraries individually or
collectively.  could undoubtedly use some more work and additional features
like reporting on other various configure-time and compile-time options that
get used for a given build, but this should get the ball rolling.

	* NEWS: fixed hanging bug related to rtarea

	* src/rt/viewarea.c:
	john points out a blatent thread locking problem where a BU_SEM_SYSCALL
is acquired prior to a bu_calloc() which itself also attempts to acquire that
same semaphore.. how the hell did that ever work??  make it use RT_SEM_RESULTS
instead since it is simply initializing the results array.  also, toss in some
flushed output to avoid flooding the mged command windows to see if that helps
with a separate lockup issue.  finally, remove the USE_FORKED_THREADS hack for
linux, which presumably was probably added because of this semaphore bug.

	remove the call to the private TclInitEncodingSubsystem() call that
worked around a 8.4/8.5 race-condition bug inside Tcl_FindExecutable() whereby
mged would crash.  it's not reproduced on a simple test case any more for
unknown reasons.

on some linux due to Tcl_StatBuf getting written past, wrong size)

	aha, finally realized what is going awry... since the samples were 
previously already allocated to the hard-coded max, the sample generator just 
used the slots as needed, keeping track of them with lt_pt_count as new ones 
were needed.  what that means, though, is that we need to ensure an allocation 
before ALL of the places that lt_pt_count is incremented since that is when we 
need/make a new point.  this (finally) fixes the crashes I was seeing when 
multiple shadow rays were requested and it actually makes sense why.  .. and 
now users can actually request ten thousand shadow rays if they really want it,

	WOO HOO... tkCanvasBezier, the custom Tk extension that has complicated 
matters for getting into apt, portage, fink, and more is now no longer needed.  
The sketch editor's bezier drawing code was rewritten to no longer use that 
canvas and instead just draw using ordinary Tk line segments, but evaluating 
the bezier curve directly just like the canvas was doing.  This was the last 
feature holding up release 7.10.2 so we're now on the green light for

	reimplement bezier curve drawing for the sketch editor so that it no 
longer uses the tkCanvasBezier custom tk modification, instead just using 
simple tk line segment drawing, but sampling/evaluating the bezier as needed.  
code for calc_bezier was taken directly from the C code and is of course a bit 
slower since it's in tcl, but certainly fast enough for most purposes where the 
degree of the bezier curve is relatively low.  that should be pulled back to C 
land as an optimization down the road.  this change (finally) fully decouples 
the brl-cad build from needing access to private tk structures during

	* include/config_win.h, src/fb/fb-pix.c, src/fb/fb-png.c, 
src/mged/rtif.c, src/rt/do.c:
	wrong direction bob.. working to remove _all_ instances of _WIN32 not 
in a core library.  besides, using chmod() is actually has a fundamental race 
condition flaw that is a security violation; and causes the new flawfinder 
regression test to fail.  hopefully msvc has _fchmod() like the other posix 
funcs it supports prefixed.  if not, need to add a libbu compatibility routine.

	whoosh, another 10% complete on the bu_bomb to bu_exit conversion 
review.  also includes a slew of custom exit() calls that can use bu_exit() as 
well as toning down a slew of overzealous exclamation point use.  (20% complete 
overall)

2007-10-22  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/clone.c: crude -c functionality

	* src/mged/clone.c: start stubbing in the -c stuff

	* src/libbu/htester.c:
	Add missing include for bu.h. Fixed sign issues. Rearranged and 
modernized.
	Added -v (version) flag and improved argument checking.

	* src/libbu/semaphore.c: make i unsigned to match nsemaphores

	* src/conv/g-nmg.c:
	use bu_exit() instead of bu_log() on unknown argument (I think that's 
what was intended... segfaults using bu_log with given args)

2007-10-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/canon/png-ipu.c: more bu_bomb to bu_exit conversions

src/conv/g-euclid1.c, src/conv/g-nff.c, src/conv/g-nmg.c, src/conv/g-obj.c:
	first 10% of the review of the bu_bomb() instances.  updating many to 
bu_exit() for the instances where the error or exit condition aren't 
catastrophic errors (i.e. they wouldn't benefit from having a stack trace of 
how we got into that state code-wise).  this also makes it easier to refactor 
usages of log & exit too to the new routine.

	* include/bu.h, include/nmg.h: tweak debug log messages for consistency

	* src/conv/dxf-g.c:
	refactor and use the new bu_exit() instead of bombing on normal exit 
conditions.  also fix a bug where specifying the the same filename for the dxf 
and g file would result in it actually 'working' because it called wdb_open() 
to open/create the the .g output file before checking if the dxf exists.  
really minor but happened to run into it when 'dxf-g asdf asdf' surprisingly 
completed successfuly

	* regress/slave_build.sh, regress/spdi.sh, regress/weight.sh, 
regress/Makefile.am, regress/flawfinder.sh, regress/gqa.sh, regress/iges.sh, 
regress/lights.sh, regress/main.sh, regress/master_fetch.sh, 
regress/master_prep.sh, regress/moss.sh, regress/nightly.sh, regress/shaders.sh:
	more consistent echo output

	* regress/solids.sh:
	more consistent echo output, use rt suffix for the solids.rt render 
script

	* NEWS:
	user-visible change.. removed longjmp warning message from applications 
that was called during bu_bomb's where an application exception handler was 
registered.  this was a common cause for confusion in the converters that use 
the jump handler during normal operations quite frequently -- made it look like 
the application was repeatedly 'crashing' during conversion yet the application 
would keep processing.

	* src/libbu/bomb.c:
	stfu about the longjmp handler being taken.  the user doesn't care and 
the message is rather misleading.

	* src/rt/viewedge.c: oops, remove debugging

	* include/bu.h, src/libbu/bomb.c:
	add a new bu_exit() function that never returns.  this function differs 
from bu_bomb() in that it supports an error code and printf style arguments.  
it should not be used for 'exceptional' exit conditions where stability and 
validity are in question; it should be used when you simply want to politely 
exit the application after printing a message (like printing application usage 
and exiting).

	* src/libbu/log.c:
	don't call va_start until after making sure it's not a null format

	* src/rt/viewedge.c: ws expand for readability

	* TODO: eliminate vararg and non-ansi cray-specific support code

qualifier.  docs purport that this is actually compliance required, so go with 
it.

	* NEWS, src/rt/opt.c:
	john noticed that the -g and -G options were not working on the rt apps 
anymore due to the change to the default aspect from 1.0 to 0.0; and sure 
enough, he was right.  the aspect ratio change (made several years ago!) was 
for the -V view aspect option, but obviously had other users in other files 
that used the value.  this changes the default back to 1.0 while also adding a 
sanity check into the argument processor to make sure the aspect ratio is 
always a sane value.

d187 1
a187 7
	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c, src/mged/cmd.c, src/librt/dg_obj.c:
	change wdb_tree_cmd() to dgo_tree_cmd() so that we can have access to 
the display geometry (particularly, to get access to the 'who' command).  
modify the behavior of the mged 'tree' command so that if you don't provide it 
any options, it will display the tree for all objects displayed.  this is in 
response and inspired by a tcl snippet from david loman that needed this 
functionality to aid in analyzing gqa output.

	* include/bu.h:
	add GCC attribute declarations (when we're compiling with GCC of 
course) that help the compiler know that a particular function has printf-style 
arguments or is a function that never returns.  add the attributes to the likes 
of bu_log, bu_flog, and bu_bomb.  code inspired from bz, thx.

	* src/libbu/log.c:
	put comments on their own line.  was going to add code to bu_log() to 
try and detect when there are no ... args, but it does not seem to work (at 
least on mac os x) as va_arg keeps scanning past the end giving the wrong count!

	* include/bu.h:
	prevent crashing on a whole slew of cases where we end up iterating 
over either a null, uninitialized, or malformed list item.  the current for 
loop while condition has to be non-NULL in order to do the next iteration, so 
make sure of it.  this prevents a crash that was detected in the display 
geometry object (where it had unitialized data).

	update to the latest API changes where create_body_from_surfs() seems 
to have chnaged to create_solid_bodies_from_surfs() in the GeometryModifyTool 
class.  looks like it just changed to return a list of bodies instead of one 
body, so we iterate over the bodies.  this is entirely untested, but seems 
right according to the docs at 
https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/ITAPS/cgm/trunk/geom/

for validity simply wasn't available during compilation.

	archer is now functional, at least seems to be fully functional now on 
Mac OS X with the slew of resource and library mods that were needed.  archer 
runs both installed an even uninstalled from a compiled source directory.

	* src/archer/archer:
	the mighty bob lieth not.  blt_library really _does_ need to be set 
AFTER blt is loaded.  the variable is wiped out during Blt_Init() yet is 
subsequently required/expected in the Tabnotebook.  this is the final mod that 
actually makes Archer work on Mac OS X (tested, and seemingly fully functional) 
and probably on Linux and BSD too now.

abort messages when things go horribly wrong

getting checked with an off-by-one error, but even with that problem fixed -- 
the command would crash mged due to an avs being freed that was never 
initialized.  avs is now always freed too so the problem goes away.

	* src/tclscripts/helplib.tcl:

	more c89 embracing.  c89 provides string.h for all of the various 
str*() and mem*() functions, so remove the check for its presence.  there is 
still likely to be work required for strict c89 conformance for the various bsd 
strings.h functions that may be in use.

	limits.h, locale.h, setjmp.g, and signal.h now all assumed as well as 
part of ongoing c89 migration.

	* src/other/blt/src/bltConfig.h:
	since we don't call blt's configure, make sure it knows that the c89 
headers are presumed.  this is intentionally here and not in the top-level 
configure to prevent repropagation of their use in the rest of the code.  blt 
should be a subconfigure.

	* src/mged/ged.c, src/librt/wdb_obj.c:

src/burst/extern.h, src/canon/canonlib.c, src/libbu/parallel.c, src/mged/ged.c:
	The c89 headers are all fair game since it's been a requirement since 
the move to ANSI c89 compliance.  So.. remove the HAVE_STDLIB_H checks and just 
use the header.  The headers <complex.h>, <fenv.h>, <inttypes.h>, <stdbool.h>, 
<stdint.h>, and <tgmath.h> were added with C99 and still need to be checked.  
There are several other c89 headers that we could just use, though, that are 
still being checked.

	* configure.ac, misc/debian/Makefile.am, misc/debian/changelog, 
misc/debian/changelog.in:
	automake has a braindead auto-inclusion of ChangeLog files that is 
causing make distcheck to fail when trying to include the debian 'changelog' 
file.  avoid the whole issue and make the file more generalized (auto-sets the 
version and time now) by turning it into an autoconf template instead.

2007-09-12  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/external/Makefile.am:
	automake 1.6 chokes on having EXTRA_DIST listed on multiple true/false 
contexts, and does not grok the += syntax.  it's still supported because it's 
still pretty prevalent, so back it up so EXTRA_DIST is only listed once.

	* NEWS:
	erik fixed an issue in the benchmark tool that was causing bad juju 
when it came time to compute the stats due to a 'log' variable shadowing a 
function in the script of the same name.  he renamed the function to lg and all 
reportedly is well with the world now on solaris (where this problem seemed to 
be isolated).

latest addition -- tab-completion for mged.  he added tab bindings for both 
classic and tcl gui mode where the commands complete out and then during 
command processing, tab expands out to the available objects including down a 
geometry path.  this has been a long-desired, often-requested feature.  very 
awesome, even if it doesn't use readline/libedit. ;)

	unsetting display will do it? or perhaps tcl84, which worked...

	* BUGS, NEWS:
	john fixed the pipe bug where pipes with discontinuous changes in inner 
radii would result in bad segments.  while he was doing that, he added some 
space partitioning optimizations to speed them up some by using bounding boxes 
and spheres for the straight ends and bends respectively.

it now uses Tk_GetScrollInfo which basically just parses a number out of a

	update from libpng 1.2.16 to 1.2.19, picking up a handful of fixes.  
nothing too critical as far as I can tell, but does reportedly include a minor 
security fix and major bug fixes (going from freshmeat categories)

	* src/rt/Makefile.am, src/rt/hurt.c:
	add an experimental 'minimal' testing ray tracer based on rt that is 
just one file.  it's a humongous unified ray tracer (hurt) that shouldn't even 
be compiled by default.  presently weighs in at about 2k lines total (not 
including lib code) with huge portions of rt functionality ripped out.  again, 
this is just for experimental use only so don't expect anything to come of this.

	* src/rt/opt.c: meh

	* src/other/tcl/generic/tcl.h: quell HAVE_DECLSPEC warning

	* include/brlcad_version.h: quell unused warning

	* include/light.h, include/shadework.h:

	remove the fblocal.h header file.  it was only used in three places 
(two files) and only contained one macro (wrapper to fb_log an error), so keep 
it simple until it's really needed.

	* src/libfb/if_disk.c:
	get rid of a memory chunk not being released until exit that doesn't 
need to be mallocated in the first place since it's a fixed size

	* NEWS, src/libbu/parallel.c, src/rt/main.c, src/rt/opt.c:
	allow the ray-tracers to use more than the available cpus for debugging 
and testing purposes.  this was previously only possible via compile-time 
modifications, but now is possible via the BU_DEBUG_PARALLEL debug flag (-\!10 
on most of the raytracers).

2007-08-17  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbn/poly.c:
	rework the quadratic root solver to handle some additional exceptional 
cases where either the coefficients or the discriminate are zero.  ideally we 
could presume we're solving equations that don't have floating point fuzz, and 
could check for for ieee zero equivalence but alas we cannot without causing 
additional instability.

	* src/librt/shoot.c:
	make sure there is a hit routine to call, otherwise it's a miss

	* NEWS, src/librt/g_rec.c:
	fixed a bug encountered when ray-tracing really tiny TGC objects 
(sub-millimeter size) caused by the REC prep routine thinking it was a valid 
right elliptical cone (when it wasn't).  the problem was due to a bad magnitude 
check and an insufficient hard-coded 'smallness' constant.  the result was rays 
that would miss portions of the tgc entirely, only counting the 'middle' 
portion that would have corresponded with an REC.

	* src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	aha, finally realized what is going awry... since the samples were 
previously already allocated to the hard-coded max, the sample generator just 
used the slots as needed, keeping track of them with lt_pt_count as new ones 
were needed.  what that means, though, is that we need to ensure an allocation 
before ALL of the places that lt_pt_count is incremented since that is when we 
need/make a new point.  this (finally) fixes the crashes I was seeing when 
multiple shadow rays were requested and it actually makes sense why.  .. and 
now users can actually request ten thousand shadow rays if they really want it, 
and it'll actually work

	* TODO:
	WOO HOO... tkCanvasBezier, the custom Tk extension that has complicated 
matters for getting into apt, portage, fink, and more is now no longer needed.  
The sketch editor's bezier drawing code was rewritten to no longer use that 
canvas and instead just draw using ordinary Tk line segments, but evaluating 
the bezier curve directly just like the canvas was doing.  This was the last 
feature holding up release 7.10.2 so we're now on the green light for 
compilation and regression testing so that a release can be made.

	* src/tclscripts/mged/skt_ed.tcl:
	reimplement bezier curve drawing for the sketch editor so that it no 
longer uses the tkCanvasBezier custom tk modification, instead just using 
simple tk line segment drawing, but sampling/evaluating the bezier as needed.  
code for calc_bezier was taken directly from the C code and is of course a bit 
slower since it's in tcl, but certainly fast enough for most purposes where the 
degree of the bezier curve is relatively low.  that should be pulled back to C 
land as an optimization down the road.  this change (finally) fully decouples 
the brl-cad build from needing access to private tk structures during 
compilation since the bezier canvas is no longer being used.

	* TODO:
	jason feels it's probably best to make mods to openNURBS itself now in 
order to fully integrate/complete the brep implementation and given his 
implementation uses libbu and libbn extensively, this move will make openNURBS 
similarly dependent.  thus, the intent is to then to effectively fork openNURBS 
and make it a noinst brl-cad sub-library (either in librt or up a level) for 
obtaining brep support.

	Shawn Baker identified a bug in g-dxf (which in turn was found in 
g-acad, g-nff, and g-obj too) where the -i argument ended up gobbling up the 
following argument incorrectly.  e.g g-dxf -i -o filename.dxf blah.g object 
would end up in a filename.dxf error.

	* src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/itcl_methods.c, 
src/other/tcl/generic/tclProc.c:
	account for a new tcl/itcl interaction bug caused by the upgrade to 
8.5, first reported by alice and soon after by john, whereby tcl panics and 
aborts mged when you call up the combination editor or other incrtcl interface 
widget.  upon further investigation, patches are made to both tcl and incrtcl 
to 1) not panic as the check is bogus/inappropriate at that place in tcl (body 
is empty and marked as such) and 2) actually provide a compiled body pointer 
(which is what it was aborting on) just with an empty string (idea extracted 
from code already in incrtcl cvs).  either fix alone takes care of the problem 
but we apply to both so we can work with combinations of system or compiled tcl 
and itcl.  woot, that was the last issue holding up release...

	restructure library linkages so that brl-cad libraries no longer list 
their dependencies as a LIBADD.  dependencies are moved into configure.ac and 
provided via _LIBS variables so that they are specified at link time.  this 
supports hybrid static library compilation as well as other more varied mixture 
configurations.  use the new _LIBS variables throughout.  probably want to 
re-combine them later into a single symbol name per library but this will 
suffice for now.

	* src/other/tcl/Makefile.am, src/other/tk/Makefile.am:
	the work is never done.  clean up the build specification for tcl/tk so 
that other targets like install, distclean, distcheck, and even uninstall 
(which tcl/tk bastages don't provide themselves) now work.  have to expand the 
unix subdir to appease distcheck success.

a problem at link time (bu, bn, and rt all use tcl).  pushing the link

	* src/bwish/main.c, src/bwish/tcl.c:
	remove the #include of the private tclInt.h header .. "shouldn't" need 
it

	* src/bwish/Makefile.am:
	itk needs access to tcl/tk private headers (time to consider moving 
this to ITK_CPPFLAGS)

	* src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/itclInt.h:
	include common.h so that we avoid tcl's compat headers (this wouldn't 
be an issue if we let incrtcl run it's configure)

	* src/libtclcad/Makefile.am:
	save problem as earlier, need to find private tcl/tk headers even if 
linking against system that doesn't have them installed

	* src/other/tcl/unix/Makefile.in, src/other/tcl/unix/configure.in:
	tcl/tk doesn't use automake so have to encourage 'make all' to work 
under IRIX make
d1298 5
a1302 30
	* autogen.sh:
	improve the version number processing so that older oddities like 
automake 1.4-p6 are better parsed and compared as that the old version doesn't 
sneak in as 1.46 but as 1.4.6 instead.  add a verbose debug line so it's more 
obvious what's being compared.

	* src/other/incrTcl/itk/generic/Makefile.am:
	son uña y mugre .. if you need one, you need the other due to version 
checks in tk.h

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am: typo, missing trailing slash

	* src/other/tcl/unix/configure, src/other/tk/unix/configure:
	recursive autogen.sh/autoreconf works with ac_config_subdirs, so 
configure is properly regenerated.  don't need/want it in cvs since it's 
repeatedly updated.

	* src/other/incrTcl/itk/generic/Makefile.am:
	even if linking against a system tcl, incrtk needs access to tcl's 
private headers in order to compile (tclInt.h in particular).  this fixes 
compilation error reported in sf bug 1672166 (Build attempts to use non-public 
Tcl header, reported by Andrew P. Lentvorski, Jr. - bsder).

	fix a bug, or at least really bad behavior, where calling up the 
wireframe of a dsp that failed to load any data would cause the app (mged) to 
abort.  the abort was due to a BU_CK_MAPPED_FILE that was occurring before an 
already existing check for whether the data was valid.  reordered correctly, 
and updated the error message to say what wasn't found so the user might have 
an idea of what to look for.

src/libdm/Makefile.am, src/libfb/Makefile.am, src/librt/Makefile.am, 
src/librtserver/Makefile.am:
	upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, 
using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as 
needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a 
rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including 
the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as 
well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance 
and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out 
with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one 
step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

	* src/gtools/g_diff.c:
	use bu_file_exists() instead of stat() to see if the file exists

	* src/mged/setup.c:
	call TclInitEncodingSubsystem() before Tcl_FindExecutable() in order to 
avoid what seems to be a race-condition bug inside Tcl_FindExecutable() 
(bizarre and unknown cause, but this works around the issue)

	* src/libtclcad/tclcadAutoPath.c:
	complete rewrite of the auto_path handling code in support of the 
forthcoming tcl/tk upgrade (8.5a5).  the logic is entirely changed so that less 
arbitrary searching is performed.  now the routine attempts to detect whether 
it's being run from a source directory or from an installed location, and 
allowing TCLCAD_LIBRARY_PATH to be obeyed for additional paths.  this needs 
tweaking/testing on other platforms, but the overall approach is a vast 
improvement to the previous.

2007-03-02  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	don't use winsock if building on cygwin, stick with UNIX style

	* src/conv/Makefile.am, src/conv/comgeom/Makefile.am, 
src/conv/iges/Makefile.am, src/conv/jack/Makefile.am, src/conv/off/Makefile.am, 
src/conv/patch/Makefile.am:
	add SYSV where needed (cygwin)

2007-03-02  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

src/other/jove/describe.com.1, src/other/jove/jove-tutorial, 
src/other/jove/teach-jove.1, src/other/jove/teach-jove.sh:
	restructure and simplify the jove tutorial/teaching stuff.

2007-03-02  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am, src/librt/Makefile.am:
	wire in libsysv as a librt dep (cygwin)

	* src/libsysv/basename.c: include appropriate headers (cygwin fix)

2007-03-02  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

src/tclscripts/lib/pkgIndex.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/pkgIndex.tcl, 
src/tclscripts/pkgIndex.tcl:
	ws

	* src/tclscripts/ami.tcl, src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl:
	aha! enlightenment hath arrived.  creating the index files actually 
sources the file args provided so when it ends up running the other amp?i.tcl 
script, it was choking on the error.  just return 0 to indicate success.

	* src/tclscripts/ami.tcl, src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl:
	heh, there's quality control for ya.. check for existance of variable 
name so we actually do some work..

	* src/tclscripts/ami.tcl:
	abort with a clean message if a tclIndex file does not exist since 
open's failure message is less than ideal

	* src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl: oop, remove debug print

	* src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl:
	abort with a clean message if a pkgIndex.tcl file does not exist since 
open's failure message is less than ideal

2007-03-01  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h: s/srtdup/strdup/ typo

	* src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl:
	how about fixing the problem instead, should be wdb_bot_smooth

2007-03-01  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl:
	wdb_smooth_bot doesn't seem to have a help entry, which causes all hlep 
to fail. commenting it out for now...

2007-03-01  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/brep_test.cpp:
	finish testing methods of dvec<>. add simple performance test for 
dvec<>.

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	"finish" implementing dvec. added operator for debugging.

	* src/librt/brep_test.cpp: add simple test for dvec<8> correctness

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	more progress on dvec class: constructors, equality and addition.

2007-02-28  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	begin fleshing out arbitrary length vector class. class definition and 
stub functions.

	* include/vector_x86.h:
	switch to SSE intrinsics (more portable than builtins)

2007-02-28  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libsysv/strlcpy.c:
	include unistd.h for size_t definition (fixes linux/amd64 build)

2007-02-28  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	fix inlining of << operator. should alleviate the problems with 
multiply-defined symbols seen earlier.

	* include/vector_x86.h:
	temporarily define replacements for missing(?) builtins

	* src/librt/brep_test.cpp, src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	explicitly include vector at compilation unit.

	* src/librt/Makefile.am:
	remove optimization flags. probably need to move the sse flags 
somewhere else too.

	* include/brep.h:
	Do not include vector.h in brep.h, since it generates multiply defined 
symbols across libraries (i.e. librt/libwdb)

	* include/vector.h:
	Wrap vector in extern c++, fix multiply-defined symbol errors on 
vequals function

2007-02-27  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/brep_test.cpp:
	Add brep_test program for simple unit testing

	* src/librt/Makefile.am: Add compilation of brep_test program

	* include/brep.h:
	Include vector class for use by brep intersection routines

	* include/vector.h, include/vector_fpu.h, include/vector_x86.h:
	Add vector class, with very initial support for simd operations.

2007-02-27  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librtserver/rtserver.c:
	Added mutex protection for session open and close

2007-02-27  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	include sysv.h to get the basename prototype (in case HAVE_BASENAME is 
not defined)

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am: strlcpy.c added

	* src/libsysv/libsysv.dsp: basename.c and strlcpy.c added

	* src/libsysv/strlcpy.c: should know its own prototype

	* src/libsysv/basename.c: errno.h defines ENAMETOOLONG
	should know its own prototype

	* include/config_win.h: HAVE_MEMSET and HAVE_STRTOK added

	* include/sysv.h: initial addition of strlcpy()
	typo in basename declaration

	* src/libsysv/strlcpy.c: initial addition of strlcpy()

	* configure.ac: test for strlcpy

2007-02-27  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	hmm.. such a conundrum.. it is nice to clean up and blow away the 
aclocal.m4 that configure drops in but now that recursive configure works, 
tcl/tk actually use their own custom aclocal.m4 (instead of acinclude.m4) so 
deleting the file has undesireable impact on build prep.  disable aclocal.m4 
deletion for now.

	* configure.ac, src/other/jove/teach-jove.in:
	add automatic generation of the teach-jove script during configure

	* src/other/libtermlib/termcap.c:
	prevent crashes if termcap is asked to perform a tgetnum() after a 
tgetent() fails

2007-02-26  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/canon/canonize.1: fact that it uses stat(2) is inconsequential

	* src/mged/rtif.c:
	use bu_same_file() instead of stat() directly to compare whether the 
saveview script database and the current database are the same file

	* src/mged/rtif.c:
	massive cleanup, ws, indentation, rewrite some of the _WIN32 sections 
so there are fewer duplicate code sections.  add a display_error function to 
report the windows read error via a dialog bog

	* src/libbu/stat.c, include/bu.h:
	add the similar routine bu_same_fd() to compare two file descriptors 
returned by open()

	* include/bu.h:
	add bu_same_file() declaration so we can use it in places

	* src/libbu/stat.c:
	add bu_same_file() routine to determine whether two file names are 
indeed the same file or not.  presently, the routine falls back to stat() to 
compare the inode numbers of the files in question

	* autogen.sh:
	some versions of automake report apple's dumb libtoolize problem 
differently, so try to be more general.

	* autogen.sh:
	support projects that use the older/deprecated arg-less AC_INIT and 
instead search for an AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE declaration hopefully instead.  also fix 
a couple missing 'no' typos during manual processing.

	* autogen.sh:
	major modification, now supporting projects that don't use one or more 
of the various autotools (e.g. not using automake, libtool, autoheader, 
libtool).  also now supports projects that have recursive configures that go 
more than one level deep.

2007-02-25  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	autoconf was complaining about AM_C_PROTOTYPES being called after 
AC_C_INLINE and AC_C_CONST, so move it up before them

2007-02-24  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	loop over potential locations instead of just testing for one.  this 
helps subdir configures clean up too if added to their configure.

	* configure.ac:
	be a little more liberal on the -all_load libtool script fix to avoid 
escaping the dollarsign

	* autogen.sh:
	add a function to locate the configure template so that we find the 
right files when running autogen.sh from an ac_config_subdirs directory, 
perhaps being configured/compiled in isolation (without making a copy of this 
script).  also add a sanity check that we did indeed end up with a configure 
script when all was said and done.

2007-02-23  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/libtie/define.h:
	common.h should always be included before any system headers

2007-02-23  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	Begin implementation of brep plot routine. actually use vlist to draw 
mesh.

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	Begin implementation of brep plot routine. start with coarse mesh from 
openNURBS.

2007-02-23  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/libtie/define.h:
	use common.h to wrap brlcad_config.h for external apps

2007-02-23  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	make sure we can restore COPYING/INSTALL when automake decides to 
ignore our umask

2007-02-22  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/nmg_bool.c, include/raytrace.h:
	add flag to silence nmg boolean eval

2007-02-22  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libwdb/brep_stub.c:
	provide a C stub of mk_brep when openNURBS is not built.

	* src/libwdb/Makefile.am, src/libwdb/brep.cpp:
	provide a C stub of mk_brep when openNURBS is not built. prevent NULL 
breps to mk_brep

	* src/librt/table.c:
	provide function table stubs for good behavior when openNURBS is not 
built

	* src/librt/g_brep.cpp:
	fix several bugs in the implementation of RT_MemoryArchive. remove use 
of dynamic_cast.

	* include/wdb.h:
	remove the conditional compilation of the mk_brep function

2007-02-21  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	updating the timestamp seems to cause an empty 
include/brlcad_config.h.in under at least some other versions of 
autoconf/autoheader so disable it for now until the reason can be determined.

	* src/other/tkimg/zlibtcl/zlibtclDecls.h:
	seems other versions in the 1.2 line also have voidpc

2007-02-21  jlowenz  <jlowenz@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/rtgeom.h:
	Remove ON_BREP conditional, rely on _cplusplus instead

2007-02-21  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/Makefile.am: add brep.h to the dist...

	* src/other/tkimg/zlibtcl/zlibtclDecls.h:
	irritating.. zlib only seems to provide voidpc with the latest versions 
of zlib, and is incompatible with the voidp type found in the older headers.  
conditionally declare using the new zlib's ZLIB_VERNUM.

	* src/other/tkimg/zlibtcl/zlibtclDecls.h:
	don't use voidpc as it's a rather new addition to libz that likely 
might not be available if we're linking against a system zlib.

	* BUGS:
	leave a note that it's known that running any of the various mged 
commands (e.g. clicking the raytrace button many times quickly, or running 
rtarea on a large model) that output a lot of data will hang mged (idle cpu 
utilization)

	* src/other/tkimg/pngtcl/Makefile.am:
	pngtcl needs the zlib cppflags too

2007-02-20  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/mged/prj_add.tcl: header and ws

	* BUGS:
	mged in console mode goes into an inf loop if you try to read from 
stdin using Tcl routines (e.g. read stdin, fgets stdin blah).; mged in GUI mode 
rejects reads on stdin

2007-02-20  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libwdb/Makefile.am: no g_brep.cpp here...

	* src/adrt/Makefile.am, src/bwish/Makefile.am, src/libdm/Makefile.am, 
src/librt/Makefile.am:
	dependancy info

2007-02-20  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/libutahrle/Makefile.am, 
src/other/libutahrle/include/Makefile.am:
	colorquant.h was moved to src/other/libutahrle/include/.

2007-02-20  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/images/Themes/Crystal_Large/Makefile.am:
	required images that need installed...

	* src/other/libpng/Makefile.am:
	libpng.txt was moved to libpng-1.2.16.txt

2007-02-20  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/burst/extern.h, src/nirt/showshot.c: need bu.h for bu_fgets()

	* src/Makefile.am:
	conditionally include opennurbs into libbrlcad (via the new noinst 
library) so that we can fully resolve all librt symbols

	* src/other/openNURBS/Makefile.am:
	create an openNURBS noinst library so that we can fully resolve 
librtserver if brep support is enabled

	* src/rttherm/Makefile.am: add missing dependency on Tcl

	* src/other/incrTcl/itcl/generic/itcl_util.c:
	the specified internal assumptions being made by blt don't hold with 
tcl 8.5 (in particular the set macro doesn't exist), so just comment out that 
section of code.

	* src/other/blt/src/bltNsUtil.h:
	comment out a couple function declarations that are apparently 
declared, at least in 8.5 though they're different/conflicting

	* src/libtclcad/tkImgFmtPIX.c:
	add support for the newer tk 8.5 Tk_PhotoExpand and Tk_PhotoPutBlock 
functions that now expect an interp parameter, but retain compilation 
functionality on previous versions too

	* src/archer/archer:
	search for tcl/tk 8.5 too (we're upgrading to it now)

	* src/mged/setup.c:
	bu_getprogname seems to be behaving now, so use it for selection of the 
executable name unless it does return null for some reason -- then default back 
to just 'mged'. try (again?) to set auto_path before Tcl_Init since we need to 
set up auto_path before init so the scripts, including init.tcl, can be found.

	* NEWS:
	john's bu_fgets() fun and my update to the various tools that needed it 
ends up improved the end-of-line (EOL) processing in about 70+ tools.  
basically any command that read in a text file using fgets().  this fix is 
particularly relevant for running our tools on windows where data files are 
frequently migrated from the unix/linux/max side without a line-ending 
conversion.

	update all usages of fgets() to instead use john's swanktastic 
bu_fgets() that behaves as one would generally want regardless of the line 
ending type of the compilation platform or of the input files.  bu_fgets() 
responds to input files that use CR (usually old mac), LF (usually unix, new 
mac), or CR/LF (usually windows) for the line ending so now these file do too 
effectivley squashing buggish/bad behavior.

	* src/adrt/librender/Makefile.am:
	heh, -lm is not a CFLAG, add it to LIBADD instead using LIBM (still 
need to get adrt's subconfigure working cleanly).

	revert the introduction of a libbu dependency to adrt, it's somewhat 
inconsequential value added just to get bu_getopt processing compared to the 
benefit of it still compiling stand-alone if needed.

	convert to bu_fgets(), which of course adds a libbu dependency if there 
wasn't one already.  this allows processing of foreign text files with 
different line endings more consistently.

	* src/conv/Makefile.am:
	turns out that anything being compiled static with gcc and against 
openNURBS needs the -fexceptions flag, that's what was causing the UnwindResume 
linkage error.  link conv-vg2g (ugh, needs renaming) and euclid_unformat 
against libbu (needed for bu_fgets).

	* src/mged/tedit.c: oop, bu_argv0 requires an argument

	* HACKING:
	should use bu_fgets() instead of fgets() since john's addition makes 
file for improved cross-platform processing support in general (parsing unix 
files on Windows, windows files on unix, etc).

	* src/libbu/fgets.c: whoops, formatting asterick garbage on M-q

	* NEWS:
	john continued to rock when he wrote bu_fgets() to allow automatic 
cross-platform line handling ala fgets(), which doesn't necessarily handle all 
of the various line endings that can be encountered (CR, LF, and CR/LF being 
the predominant ones).  in particular, this fix addresses a bug that was 
reported on windows with dxf-g parsing files from another platform incorrectly. 
 note the fix as it applies to dxf-g at least.

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	use a filesystem group, these routines have nothing to do with logging

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libbu/libbu.vcproj:
	bu_fgets.c was missing from the vc7 build file, but we can just go 
ahead and add its rename of fgets.c

	* include/bu.h, src/libbu/Makefile.am, src/libbu/bu_fgets.c,

	* src/tclscripts/ami.tcl, src/tclscripts/ampi.tcl:

	* HACKING: at least for now.. bu_dirname() instead of dirname()

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libbu/libbu.vcproj, src/libbu/libbu.dsp:
	add dirname.c to the msvc build files

	* include/bu.h, src/libbu/malloc.c:
	get rid of the bu_strdup() dead code and comment how it's really an 
interface macro pass through that provides file:line info when bu debugging is 
enabled

	* src/libbu/malloc.c:
	remove bu_dirname(), was moved to new file dirname.c.

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am: add dirname.c to the compilation

	* src/libbu/dirname.c:
	extract bu_dirname() from malloc.c and put it in its own file.  should 
consider using dirname() since it's part of posix (along with rt_basename() -> 
basename()).

	* src/mged/tedit.c:
	searching for a text editor.. needs the path on argv0, not just the 
name of the binary unless it's going to go hunting for it with bu_which().

	* include/bu.h: export bu_argv0

	* src/nirt/str_manip.c:
	remove the unnecessary definition of basename() .. libsysv provides a 
better version if it truely is not provided by the system.

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	basename() is guaranteed by libsysv now, so no need to check for 
HAVE_BASENAME

	* src/libbu/brlcad_path.c:
	progname is often not the same as argv[0], so modify bu_getprogname() 
accordingly and expose the bu_argv0() function to distinguish between the two.

	* include/sysv.h: add basename()

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am:
	add the new basename.c file, extracted from openbsd (bsd licensed)

	* src/libsysv/basename.c:

availability

src/libsysv/strtok.c, src/libsysv/strsep.c:

	* src/libsysv/strdup.c, src/libsysv/bsdselect.c: deknrify the function

	* include/Makefile.am:
	add the new sysv.h header to the noinst header list.

	* include/sysv.h:
	add an initial interface file for libsysv.  this compatibility 
interface shouldn't really be included throughout the package, but may 
ultimatley get added to common.h as part of configuration compatibility.

	* autogen.sh:
	simplify some more, make sed a requirement and abort if it seems to be 
unavailable

	* autogen.sh:
	collapse the version checks into one routine.  improve the version 
checks so that they work more reliably for various version string formats.  
this refactoring should fix a bug in the script where automake 1.10 was being 
incorrectly processed as 1.1.0 among other benefits and code simplification.

	* configure.ac:
	AM_PROG_CC_STD was deprecated and later made obsolete by automake 1.8 
with the functionality merged into AC_PROG_CC.  the macro attempted to ensure 
that the compiler is running in 'ansi mode'.  add AM_PROG_CC_C_O to handle 
compilation of non-libtool stuff with compilers that don't happen to support 
the common -c -o syntax.  latest automake seems to be complaining about the 
option being missing/needed (reported by IriX64) during autogen.sh.

options (-b, -l, -s, -i) and behaves more closely to cmp.  supports processing 
over files byte-by-byte or pixel-by-pixel, comparing values, tabulating 
results, and reporting them in the format requested.

	* bench/pixcmp.c:
	major rewrite, add support for -s, -l, and -i options for silent, 
verbose output (ala cmp's -l option), and support for skipping input.  make the 
return/error codes more uniform as well as more detail on the usage.  still 
need to actually add the print statement for -l, but everything else should be 
done.  basic operation and previous use remains unaffected.

	* bench/Makefile.am: include the new pixcmp.1 manual page

	there does seem to be a ray-trace consistency failure in the solids.sh 
regression test case where it fails on Mac OS X with one pixel exhibiting an 
off-by-many error on the edge of the middle ARB8.  this only seems to occur 
when using an optimized -O3 compile (and using -fno-unsafe-math-optimizations 
seems to make no difference) possibly indicating a floating point/tolerance 
issue that needs to be accounted for so that results are exactly repeatable 
regardless.

	give adrt some distinctiveness in the header

	* src/adrt/configure.ac: add a header and footer

	* src/brlman/awf.in, src/brlman/brlman.in: add local variables footer

	* misc/enigma/Makefile.am: sources

	* misc/enigma/enigma.1:
	Joerg spelled CBW incorrectly -- the proper project name is the Crypt 
Breaker's Workbench (this mistake has been impressively spread around the world 
now).

	* misc/enigma/configure.ac:
	test application of PD headers, add a footer too along with detail that 
enigma comes from the Crypt Breaker's Workbench software
d3653 1

	* sh/header.sh: PD work else statement was swapped, fixed.

sections.
d3657 1

	recognize lexer and parser files, keep mode and tab-width first in the 
variable list in case variables/values is ever customized
d3659 3
a3661 51
	* sh/header.sh: recognize lexer and parser files

	* sh/footer.sh:
	let .ac and .in files use the specified indent instead of forcing 8

	* misc/enigma/Makefile.am:
	remove the Makefile.defs since enigma has it's own configure and will 
otherwise mess with AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS

	* sh/footer.sh:
	make .in and .ac files use the autoconf major mode instead of Makefile

	* doc/legal/Makefile.am, doc/legal/gfdl.txt, doc/legal/gpl.txt:
	remove the GPL and GFDL licenses.  they are no longer used.  all GPL 
code was relicensed to LGPL, all documentation under the dual-licensing 
GPL/GFDL were relicensed under the BDL (BSD documentation license).

	* misc/enigma/Makefile.am, misc/enigma/configure.ac, 
misc/enigma/configure.in:
	rename configure.in to configure.ac

	* misc/cvs2cl.pl, misc/Makefile.am:
	remove unused ChangeLog processing perl script (rcs2log is used instead)

	* misc/brlcad.spec.in:
	clean up header, add footer, remove reference to GPL as the license

	pull system headers up ahead of our headers

2007-02-07  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/libpng/pngconf.h:
	disable the linux setjmp.h double-inclusion protection (at least for 
now) on the assumption that we will get the same setjmp.h and this won't be a 
problem.  add a note that this was modified by us for BRL-CAD.

	since AC_OUTPUT won't touch the brlcad_config.h.in template if it 
already exists and is unmodified, explicitly touch the file.  this of course 
updates the timestamp and avoids an unnecessary invocation of config.status and 
autoheader in the include/ directory on subsequent compilations.
d3668 1
a3668 3
	* src/librtserver/Makefile.am:
	if librt has opennurbs symbols, include the opennurbs library so that 
the library will hopefully be fully resolved and contained.
d3671 12
a3682 7
	instead of automatically modifying the configure.ac file if there are 
unsupported known macros being used, just report what those macros are and 
blather on about how that really indicates that probably the version of the 
autotools is specified incorrectly in autogen.sh or that inappropriate macros 
are being used in configure.ac.

	* regress/weight.sh: use name of script as prefix, not wgt
d3696 1
a3696 128
	* regress/weight.sh:
	update script being used for comparison.  whitespace differences cause 
the test to fail where it should succeed.  include timestamp lines and the 
density table lines since the script strips them anyways, otherwise a 
whitespace script might collapse too many consecutive blank lines.

2007-02-05  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/libpng/Makefile.am:
	either PNG_NO_MMX_CODE or PNG_NO_ASSEMBLER_CODE are required for 
successful compilation on AMD64 Linux with gcc due to linking of 32-bit 
assembly with 64-bit object files.  compiling with -m32 avoids the problem but 
just tack on PNG_NO_MMX_CODE for now since that doesn't limit 
compilation/features like the other two options.  should probably test for this 
mix in configure and set some cppflags accordingly.

TCL_CPPFLAGS so compilation pulls headers from within src/other/libtcl instead. 
 since bu.h and raytrace.h include tcl foo, this implicates a change across

	update of the bundled zlib from version 1.2.2 to 1.2.3; per the zlib 
website, this eliminates a potential security vulnerability when decoding 
invalid compressed data (VU#238678 / SA11129) as well as eliminates a potential 
security vulnerability when decoding specially crafted compressed data 
(VU#680620 / SA15949). other updates included, see the zlib release notes for 
details.

	the script to M-x indent-regions now already exists (indent.sh). just 
need to run the script on various directories one at a time while making sure 
indentation isn't confused by replicated braces in preprocessor wrappings

	convert all of the lingering getopt calls to bu_getopt (as well as the 
related getopt globals optind, opterr, optarg) -- libbu's getopt has the 
benefit of being re-entrant and is portable to environments where getopt() may 
not be available.

	remove the png headers from our include directory.  png_cppflags are 
now provided by configure and appropriately set to src/other/libpng if we're 
not using a system libpng.  this should help to avoid header conflicts aside 
from just unnecessarily duplicating 3rd party headers. use the new png_cppflags 
as appropriate, though have to add it to _CFLAGS since per target _CPPFLAGS 
support wasn't added until automake 1.7 (and brl-cad allows anything 1.6.0+).

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	rename ogl_open, ogl_close, and ogl_choose_visual to have an fb_ prefix 
to avoid namespace collisions with libdm.  this should probably be done more 
comprehensively, but gets past the linking error du jour.  declare funcs one 
per line while we're in here.

zero: ((2 <= size) && (size <= INT_MAX)) .. presumably they want a buffer big 
enough to stash their \r\n or somesuch.

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	one step closer, stub out the matrix transformation on solids

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c:
	use the new rt_mirror() function for the guts to f_mirror().  the 
latter is now just a wrapper on the tcl/mged command interface semantics.  part 
of general effort to move mged's editing facilities into librt.

	* src/librt/Makefile.am: add new mirror.c file

	* include/raytrace.h: add the new rt_mirror func

	* src/librt/mirror.c:
	add a new rt_mirror() routine for mirroring an object about a specified 
axis.  the routine is derived from mged's f_mirror command hook and is one step 
closer towards getting rid of the switch on primitive types.  routine takes a 
database instance, a from and to object name, and the axis and returns a 
directory pointer to the new mirror object.

	* include/raytrace.h, src/conv/euclid-g.c, src/conv/iges/brep.c, 
src/librt/nmg_eval.c, src/librt/nmg_extrude.c, src/librt/nmg_mod.c:
	remove the tolerance parameter from nmg_invert_shell.  it's not used, 
contrary to the commented purpose, and just complicates the interface 
unnecessarily so remove it.

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c:
	check for valid access before looking up the object

	* src/mged/chgmodel.c: fix comment, mirror commands, not m command

	* sh/Makefile.am, sh/template.sh:
	initial addition of this file template script.  it generates an empty 
template file with a standard header and footer based on the provided license 
and file type.  basically, it's a warpper on the header.sh and footer.sh script 
along with other clean-up steps generally needed.  add script to dist.

	* sh/header.sh: oop another ref to gpl/gfdl removed.

	* sh/header.sh: should not be using the gpl or gfdl any more

	* sh/Makefile.am:
	it's a nifty generic script, but there's still no real pressing need or 
justification to install it.

	* sh/copyright.sh:
	no need to find configure.ac -- just let it use the current directory 
if no arguments are specified.

	* sh/indent.sh:
	no need to find configure.ac -- just let it use the current directory 
if no arguments are specified.  the helper script can still be searched for as 
needed.

	* sh/ws.sh:
	no need to find configure.ac -- just let it use the current directory 
if no arguments are specified

	* sh/ws.sh: s/one lines/on lines/ typo

	on individual files or in batch mode, and is intended to be run
	periodically to help ensure consistent formatting.  Currently, the
	following actions are performed by default (but can be selected
	individually at run-time):

	  a) removes whitespace on lines that only have whitespace.
	  b) removes whitespace at the end of any line.
	  c) removes successive blanks lines so there are no more than two
	    in a row anywhere in a given file.  WS_SUCCESSIVE=2
	  d) removes all blank lines at the end of a file.
	  e) ensures that there is a newline at the end of file.

	* TODO:
	add support for arbitrary matrix transformations to torus primitive .. 
while there's certainly question on what this means to the mathematics of the 
implicit form (they're no longer mathematically a torus), the underlying 
modeling capacity is still needed and storing a transformation matrix or at 
least scaling vectors in the primitive (or above the primitive) would go a long 
way to handling this somewhat unique case.

	clarify the license detail that this particular file, as part of the 
build system, is BSD licensed.  the lgpl was used before since this file is 
often encountered first, but instead use the correct header and include a note 
about how the license applied, referring to COPYING for more details.

	* configure.ac:
	similarly disable all the java checks if we're --without-java

	* configure.ac:
	restructure the X11 checks so that if --without-x11 is provided, all of 
the associated x11 checks are also disabled as well so we don't waste time 
testing for things that will not be used.  similarly, don't auto-add /usr/X11R6 
to the search paths or add the extra restart paths unless we're in automatic or 
yes mode

	Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD 
Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and 
BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL 
and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the 
FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms 
and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their 
purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries 
without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

	ugh, what tedium.  put some effort towards cleaning up the doxygen 
labels and making the headers more consistent.  also exclusively using @@ for 
doxygen instead of \ to try to keep things more consistent.

	* src/libfb/if_ap.c:
	dept of energy is part of the u.s. government and while there ability 
to claim copyright back in '89 is dubious, since they are government they can 
fall under the same significant conversion and copyright assignment conditions 
that was initially required.  so either way, the header can be cleaned up.

	* src/libfb/if_X24.c:
	header cleanup, happens to be a sun file, so integrate the bsd-style 
license proper.

	* src/conv/patch/pull_comp.sh, src/conv/patch/pull_solidsub.sh:
	add bsd headers to helper scripts

(c) for consistency just like everything else. also, more importantly, add the 
ability to use this script to process individual files (e.g. in conjunction 
with find).  if there's an argument list, that is what will be processed.  
otherwise, it will do the usual task of processing everything under the src 
root that it recognizes (and that isn't exempted).

	for ease of (cvs diff) comparisons and review -- and since they are 
presently stored in CVS for Windows build convenience -- sort the contents of 
the tclIndex and pkgIndex.tcl files (taking the comment header into account)

	* src/rttherm/Makefile.am:
	use the EXCEPTIONS value as a LDFLAG so that we get -fexceptions here 
when compiling with the gcc compiler and using the new openNURBS library.  
unclear why we only get the __Unwind_Resume symbol error on only rttherm and 
not any other binaries.

	* configure.ac:
	this fixes another compilation/linking issues involving the new C++ 
openNURBS library integration. added is a check for the -fexceptions gcc 
compiler/linker flag that takes care of an unresolved __Unwind_Resume symbol 
error when linking rttherm (quite odd that only rttherm seems to provoke that 
symbol being undefined).  the symbol relates to exception handling support in 
gcc that would otherwise be provided if linking with g++.  could also have 
probably added the -shared-libgcc flag as well for the same result.  thanks to 
Andrew Pinski for this particular fix.

	* configure.ac:
	this fixes a compilation/linking issue involving the new C++ openNURBS 
library integration.  it accounts for bad behavior in pre 1.5.8 libtool where 
the generated libtool script would contain an -all_load directive on the linker 
line for libraries that use convenience libraries as part of the 
whole_archive_flag_spec.  that flag in turn causes gcc to fail with various 
errors on duplicate standard math and io symbols.  the libtool script is simply 
stripped of the -all_load directive, which causes libtool to correctly just 
include all the convenience libraries and link the objects manually.  this 
problem was specific to the default libtool (1.5) provided on mac os x (10.4).

	* m4/compiler.m4:
	add an option, a third parameter, that if set to anything will inform 
the macro to not keep the flag as a CFLAG/LDFLAG/etc leaving it up to the user 
to do something with the provided bc_[param2]_works variable

least the first object name)

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	make at least the copy command work without an interpreter.. really all 
of the librt needs to be able to function without an interpreter necessarily 
being present... a good start would be some wrapper function/macro over 
Tcl_AppendResult w/ bu_log

	* src/librt/track.c:
	let WDB_TCL_CHECK_READ_ONLY work even if there isn't an interpreter.. 
that define really belongs in a header.

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	comment that those are the guts to the 'cp' command, let 
WDB_TCL_CHECK_READ_ONLY work even if there isn't an interpreter

	* src/rt/do.c, NEWS:
	awesome.. not only did karel (aka clock3) identify and report on an 
animation bug in rt with extensive detail, he went on to trace down the problem 
and actually identified the bug.  a variable that keeps track of frame progress 
was not being reset to null after a frame was completed causing subsequent 
frames to dereference an invalid pointer and segfault.  apply the fix from sf 
bug 1629285 (persistent segfaults during animation - with a fix). this affected 
all raytracers, but not library users.  excellent work, karel.  excellent.

	* src/rt/main.c:
	be less harsh about this being a debug build -- just say debug symbols 
are available and leave it at that

compile/traverse

	initial import of the openNURBS initiative's nurbs toolkit.  the 
toolkit consists of code for reading/writing .3dm files used by Rhino as well 
as nurbs evaluation and other geometry processing facilities.  the library is 
being evaluated for .3dm support as well as potentially gutting the existing 
nurbs primitive and using openNURBS evaluation routines instead (still probably 
need to implement ray shot evaluation).  this is version 200612050 (aka 4.0).

	this is also a C++ library, the first integration of an external C++ 
dependency into BRL-CAD.  additional support/infrastructure will be needed to 
support this in configure.  there's still, however, a policy/convention of 
"containment" so that C++ does not propagate into the existing BRL-CAD 
libraries.  any additions that utilize c++ still have to be entirely modular 
(and optional) for the time being.

	* NEWS:
	mged help command now shows help for all args listed.  this fixes a bug 
with the 'help' command where issuing something like 'helpdevel aip hist' would 
report the non-existance of the 'aip hist' command.  now correctly returns the 
help for all listed individually as was documented.  this issue was reported by 
an analyst at arl.

	* src/tclscripts/helpcomm.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl:
	fix an mged bug in the various help commands so that they actually work 
with more than one command listed (as their own help messages implied they were 
capable of).  affects help, helplib, and helpdevel which now take zero, one, or 
more command names.

	* src/librt/bool.c:
	the comments around the conditional were entirely unintentional.. from 
the rt_g.debug to RT_G_DEBUG change that was made in 2001.  it's just taken 
this long before someone actually tried to shoot a bundle of rays with librt 
(or at least this long for someone to complain about the verbose blather)

otherwise link against TCL
d408 9
a416 4
	* configure.ac:
	so we apparently can't actually call any opengl function (at least on 
macosx) without a valid context or it will cause a bus error, so instead just 
link against some useful symbols.

without all the repetition by using macros that call the corresponding routine.

	* BUGS:
	the debugbu 2 bug occurs because bu_memdebug_add() is not called unless 
memory checking is enabled via bu_debug.  so when bu_debug is set to 2 or 3, it 
ends up reporting errors during bu_free() for items that were allocated and 
were not yet being tracked.

	according to one of the tcl devs (thx jenglish), Tk_IsMapped() is not 
what we should be using to determine if the tkwin is 'valid' .. being 'mapped' 
apparently means that there is a window that has been explicitly mapped via a 
Tk_MapWindow() call or is otherwise fully drawn/displayed.  fall back to a 
simple non-null check instead.

	Consistently use integers instead of shorts for the region id, air 
code, GIFT material code, and los value for the rt_comb_internal structure.  
region ids are already handled almost entirely as integers throughout the code, 
but the usage of shorts in the comb structure seems to be a carry-over from 
prior v4 format support that was never changed.  a review of code seems to 
indicate that the only negative impact should only be rather unsupported 
behavior if someone actually reverts a v5 db to v4 that has region idents that 
overflow short.  (this mod is in support of JTCG/ME and addresses sf bug 
1532661 "Mismatch In Size of region_id" reported by Tom Browder)

	was removed from bu_prmem()'s output.  Minor benefit:  The table now

	* misc/win32-msvc/brlcad.dsw:
	libtclcad isn't really needed for the library build for most ray-trace 
purpose applications.  it'd only be useful if someone wanted to manually 
compile the mged sources and then use this to link against.  since that doesn't 
currently seem to be a need, going ahead and reverting/removing it.

	* NEWS, TODO, src/mged/tedit.c:
	fairly comprehensive rewrite of tedit() for the ted command that merges 
the windows version in with the unix version in what should be a pretty 
platform independent manner.  this version tries a lot harder to find a usable 
editor other than /bin/ed including checking EDITOR even on Windows (there was 
some bug report for this, but can't find it atm).  it'll also kick off TextEdit 
on Mac OS X now as well as trying emacs and vi, before falling back on jove as 
the editor if it can find it.  still doesn't do run-time checking of the editor 
itself, but it should be more consistent.  also removed the closing of 
descriptors which lets console editors work and allows gui editors to be aborted

	* src/libfb/if_X.c, src/libfb/if_ogl.c, src/libfb/if_wgl.c:

	avoid debug mode namespace conflicts with libfb's null interface (where 
HIDDEN becomes /**/)

	* src/liboptical/sh_stack.c:
	avoid debug mode namespace conflicts with libfb's stack interface 
(where HIDDEN becomes /**/)

	* src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	final mod to allow for arbitrary counts of light point samples.  the 
point sample array is allocated in batches of SOME_LIGHT_SAMPLES.

	* include/light.h, src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	next step in the incremental update, dynamically allocate the light 
sample points array instead of using a fixed size.

 be consistent with the printing and the command name category (sedit).

	* src/mged/buttons.c:
	print out the expected/desired state so the user has a clue as to what 
to do to resolve the problem when not in the right editing mode.

	* src/mged/chgtree.c:
	not_state() now reports the desired state too, so no need for the extra 
printing
d2748 2
a2749 40
	* src/mged/edsol.c:
	add a lot of checks for valid pointers as part of isolating a 'P' 
binding crash bug (sf bug 1375751: P shuts down mged).  the crash was the 
result of a bus error inside of Tcl_AppendResult of all places, where the 
second Tcl_AppendResult() after the one inside not_state() would cause a crash. 
 this may indicate some other interp initialization problem, but the fix in 
place does seem to keep things going nicely.

	* src/tclscripts/mged/callbacks.tcl:
	quell warnings about mged_display not being set, make sure the 
variables even exist

everyone else (currently still provided by machine.h)

	* src/mged/chgview.c, src/mged/cmd.c, src/mged/vrlink.c:
	enable the 'pov' command, getting rid of the peculiar undocumented 
TCP_FILES define.  move cmd_pov over to chgview.c like the comment suggests. 
(note that the command guts are over in librt)

	* src/mged/dm-X.c, src/mged/dm-ogl.c, src/mged/dm-wgl.c, 
src/mged/mged_dm.h:
	move the common_dm() decl over to mged_dm.h

	* src/mged/attach.c:
	remove apparently dead code, 'do_2nd_attach_prompt()'

	* src/mged/attach.c:
	looks like bezier canvas support should now be available for both 
windows studio build projects. libtclcad should build sans tk sources now, try 
enabling it.

	* src/libfb/if_wgl.c:
	initial stub of a libfb IF_WGL 'wgl' interface to replace usage of 
'ogl' on Windows.  this is done to support the libdm design intent of 
interfaces for each style of display manager, instead of piggy-backing on top 
of 'ogl' and complicating the code with preprocessor WIN32 checks everywhere.  
haven't updated the names/code yet.. just a stub file.

	* src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:
	add an initial implementation of a WindowsGL 'wgl' libdm interface 
using the former dm-ogl_win32.c code as a basis.  remove the XGL sections and 
add boilerplate checks that makes sure this interface can be compiled alongside 
the 'ogl' interface.  expects DM_OGL to be defined in order to get 
functionality.

header

	update comment to note that the ogl interface is specifically an X11 
OpenGL interface (i.e. it's XGL.. might want to rename it to that someday, but 
oh well).  ws

	* misc/win32-msvc7/libdm/libdm.vcproj:
	use the new DM_WGL interface instead of the former DM_OGL interface so 
that the latter may also be compiled at the same time (e.g. cygwin/mingw 
environments) but also to allow the ogl interface to consistently imply just 
one interface.

	* misc/win32-msvc7/fbserv/fbserv.vcproj:
	fbserv_win.c was consolidated into fbserv.c

	* NEWS, include/light.h, src/liboptical/sh_light.c:
	allow unlimited light samples during ray-tracing instead of a fixed 
compile-time count (was 128)

	* include/dm-ogl.h:
	make the 'ogl' interface be X11 OpenGL only.  windows is being moved to 
its own 'wgl' interface

	* include/dm-wgl.h:
	initial dm-wgl.h header for a new 'wgl' interface, separating it from 
the X11-based ogl interface and cleaning up the code

	* configure.ac:
	try enabling the automatic detection/compilation of tcl/tk now that 
tkCanvasBezier is cleaned up to not use internal Tk headers.  probably still 
need to work on Tcl autopath issues, but give it a shot.  also add a slew of 
checks for WGL so that a new framebuffer and display manager interface may be 
defined on Windows that is separate from the ogl interface.  this is important 
for cygwin/mingw systems where it is possible to use both wgl and ogl style 
interfaces simultaneously.  also rename LIBRT to RT to be consistent with the 
other BRL-CAD library AC_SUBST values

	* src/fbserv/Makefile.am, src/fbserv/fbserv.c, src/fbserv/fbserv_win.c:
	refactor fbserv.c and fbserv_win.c so that there is only one file that 
supports/contains all of the mods that fbserv_win.c was presuming.  this needs 
testing but is more functionally clean, relying on configure-style 
tests/defines instead of WIN32 where easily possible

include/bn.h, include/fb.h, src/canon/Makefile.am, src/canon/asize.c:
	refactor the three asize.c implementations (libbn, libfb, & canon) into 
just one.  libbn had the most comprehensive and updated version, but the logic 
belongs in libfb.  so, the bn_common autosizing functions are now consolidated 
to libfb, refactoring accordingly.

the tcl/tk 'TIP' process).  this change should make it feasible to compile this 
code without having to have a copy of the Tk sources around .. more testing 
needed.

	* NEWS:
	new script for computing BRL-CAD file line counts.  this computes the 
line counts of the various categories of files in the project including 
documentation, source code (distinguishing header code from non-header source 
code), 3rd party code (e.g. tcl/tk, png, urt, etc), and build system files.

	* sh/lines.sh:
	instead of using the 'total' summary from the wc command, calculate the 
sum directly ourselves using a simple sum function. this slows things down 
considerably, but is necessary to avoid the default behavior of xargs on linux 
that can break up a piped stream into multiple invocations (resulting in 
multiple total lines).

	* sh/lines.sh: consistent line lengths

	* src/util/lowp.c: missing std headers

	* src/rt/viewxray.c, src/sig/interp.c: quell warning

	* src/libdm/clip.c:
	quell warning on INFINITY (again), instead renaming the define to 
CLIP_DISTANCE (just without changing the value this time)

	* src/README:
	add an introductory header that hopefully better explains the various 
content in the src/ directory as well as a basic summary of just what it 
comprises before getting into the individual content dirs

	* sh/Makefile.am: add the new lines.sh script

	* sh/lines.sh:
	initial revision of a new tool that computes how many lines of code 
BRL-CAD uses.  this separates the code into various categories such as 
documentation, build system, non-project code, and the actual source code.

function doesn't call perror for you, so the caller may need to if they 
expected it before.

	one more restructuring step, this time propagating the dbip so that the 
copy_ functions have the right signature to be used as a db_functree callback.  
instead of proliferating the usage of the dbip global pointer even further, 
only the top-level hook functions use the global then all other routines are 
using the one passed as an argument (denoted with _dbip instead of dbip to 
avoid shadowing).
d6552 3
a6554 5
	* src/mged/clone.c:
	another restructuring step.  propagate a resource pointer for librt and 
don't pass around the tcl interpreter directly so that we can use thses 
functions directly as db_functree callbacks (instead stash the interp into our 
state client data structure).

	* src/mged/clone.c:
	begin efforts to port clone and tracker towards supporting v5 
databases.  the db_getmrec() function and associated union records are v4 
specific structures that don't apply to v5 so it basically needs to be 
reimplemented from scratch..  start by initializing all pointers to NULL and 
getting rid of the useless propagation of ClientData.

	* src/librt/db_io.c:
	comment that db_getmrec loads records into a buffer in v4 format

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	er, unless i'm blind, there's no difference between the _WIN32 and 
non-_WIN32 section.  collapse into one

generated files

	* doc/Makefile.am:
	add pad_file.xml.in to the dist and clean up after it on a distclean

	* doc/pad_file.xml.in:
	Add an initial PAD template file for BRL-CAD.  The version and date 
details are filled in by configure so that the file doesn't have to keep 
getting updated (needs more work) during release time.  This file is used by a 
lot of on-line distribution sites (predominantly by shareware distributors, but 
others including open source too), so that it is easier to add the package to 
those on-line distribution sites.  PAD is Portable Application Description, an 
XML data description used by application authors to dissemminate information to 
anyone interested in their software products.

binary instructions up higher in the file.

now includes the portability heritage and portability details, details on the 
geometry representation types, and expanded details on what is provided 
tool-wise

	* doc/description.txt:
	Fill in ALL of the description details about BRL-CAD including 
different length description formats useful when preparing materials for 
informational websites, software distribution sites, package management 
systems, release announcement materials, and more.  includes links to 
frequently needed materials like the trackers, keywords/categories, and details

	* src/rt/opt.c:
	initialize a slew of uninitialized values using proper casts for the 
fastf_t types.  uninitialized garbage was causing debug and runtime problems on 
altix

	* NEWS: ported jove to SGI Altix platform, fixed crash bug.

	* src/other/jove/jove_term.c:
	prevent jove from crashing on SGI Altix due to clamping the tgetstr 
pointer to 32-bit when it needs to be 64-bit.  this requires actually including 
the right headers so that tgetstr is properly declared, but declare it to what 
it should be regardless since.. this is jove.

	john continues on his dxf-g rampage with manpage enhancements and additional support to dxf-g for ELLIPSE entities.  earlier he added support for LWPOLYLINE, MTEXT, LEADER, ATTRIB, SOLID, and ATTDEF entity states -- all grouped into one news entry for dxf-g enhancements.
d2377 22
a2398 2
	* NEWS:
	fixed asc2g bug reading files with carriage returns.  if you attempted to run asc2g on a .asc file that came directly from the windows platform and had embedded carriage returns ('\r'), it would incorrectly parse the v4 I units version string dumping out a wierd undecipherable overlapping error (printing the carriage return), now it handles them correctly.
d2400 1
a2400 1
	* NEWS: added dbupgrade manual page.  one didn't exist
d2402 3
a2404 2
	* NEWS:
	updated the g2asc manual page with format details.  the manpage still talked about it being necessary for platform independent conversions, language and details were updated to note that this is no longer the case (that the binary will work just fine).  also mentions that binary and ascii are open specs, though ascii is subject to deprecation change without notice whereas the binary is not. also that the ascii should not be relied upon by external developers but that it is currently a tcl command script.
d2406 1
a2406 2
	* NEWS:
	fixed g_diff attribute comparison issue.  when doing a g_diff, attributes were not being compared in order if the db command fails to tclify the exported version resulting in a binary 'these objects seem to differ' when they did not.  the tclification was improved so it can perform a proper ordered attribute comparison under more cases.
d2408 1
a2408 2
	* NEWS:
	g_diff reports more detail whether differences exist.  if the external forms are being compared, it will report whether the lengths differ or the contents (previously was an unknown either/or difference).  also g_diff will summarize and actually say that it found no differences instead of just ending a statement like there is something more like the following:
d2410 1
a2410 2
	* NEWS:
	g2asc now saves additional _GLOBAL attribute values.  previously, only the units and title were exported so that if a user had manually added additional attributes they were not being saved, now they are saved as attr commands in the ascii format.  (a situation where this was important was where a 'disclaimer' and 'description' attribute were added in addition to the title.
d2412 3
a2414 2
	* NEWS:
	fixed g2asc export of null units bug.  there was a situation where the current units could not be determined and a (null) was export to the ascii file.  this would halt an asc2g.  if the units cannot be determined, they are not output (i.e. no (null)) now.

	* bench/pixcmp.c: missing string.h

	* TODO:

	* src/libfb/tcl.c, src/libfb/fb_obj.c, src/libfb/fbserv_obj.c, src/libfb/if_4d.c:
	revert the libbu memory management changes to libpkg just to be safe.  if someone happens to call bu_semaphore_acquire on a BU_SEM_SYSCALL semaphore, the call will block since libbu utilizes that semaphore internally (and it's expected that callers know this..).

Thu Mar 30 00:01:05 2006  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/rt/main.c:
	When complaining about not getting an MGED database, we now accurately report
	the name of the program (from argv[0]) being run, rather than pretending that
	all rtuif programs are called "rt".

Wed Mar 29 22:26:53 2006  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/rt/viewweight.c:
	Since we have moved to calling bu_malloc instead of malloc, we have to be
	careful not to acquire BU_SEM_SYSCALL prior to calling bu_malloc (since it
	tries to acquire that semaphore, and the program would hang forever).

	Of course, it would be better not to overload BU_SEM_SYSCALL in this
	instance, but to allocate an application semaphore.  That is a more sweeping
	change for later.

	* NEWS:
	john fixed the mged crash bug where running the B command on bad geometry would cause the crash.  he reports that This was caused by a bug in db_recurse() where it would try to free an rt_db_internal even when there was nothing to free. The fix was to check that there is actually something there before freeing. This eliminates the crashing, but the bad geometry will still not be drawn.

	* src/librt/nurb_trim.c:
	Removed nmg_uv_in_lu(). Moved to nmg_rt_isect.c.

	* src/librt/nmg_rt_isect.c:
	Moved nmg_uv_in_lu() to here from nurb_trim.c, since it didn't seem to be a nurbs-only function.

	* include/raytrace.h:
	remove most (if not all?) core rt functionality (moved to rt.h). remove nurb functionality (moved to nurb.h).

	* include/nurb.h:
	Added nurb-related structures from nmg.h. removed dependency on raytrace.h, replaced with dependency on rt.h. Added function declarations removed from raytrace.h.

	* include/nmg.h:
	moved nurbs-related structures back to the nurb.h header. nmg.h now includes nurb.h as a dependency.

	* src/libfb/fb_obj.c: use bu_calloc and bu_free instead of calloc

	* src/libfb/fbserv_obj.c, src/libfb/tcl.c:
	use bu_malloc and bu_free instead of malloc

Sun Jan 22 23:44:49 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h:
	remove the need for HAVE_STDLIB_H and need for stdlib.h and stddef.h.  instead, let files that use the offsetof macros include stdlib.h.  don't need decls for malloc,calloc,realloc any more.  provide bu_offsetof() macro

	* include/cmd.h:
	add header protections, conditionally include sys/time.h correctly

	* src/librt/g_arb.c, src/librt/g_cline.c, src/librt/g_dsp.c, src/librt/g_ebm.c, src/librt/g_ehy.c, src/librt/g_ell.c, src/librt/g_epa.c, src/librt/g_eto.c, src/librt/g_grip.c, src/librt/g_half.c, src/librt/g_hf.c, src/librt/g_part.c, src/librt/g_rhc.c, src/librt/g_rpc.c, src/librt/g_submodel.c, src/librt/g_superell.c, src/librt/g_tgc.c, src/librt/g_torus.c, src/librt/g_vol.c, src/librt/nmg_ck.c, src/librt/nmg_fuse.c, src/librt/nmg_index.c, src/librt/nmg_info.c, src/librt/nmg_inter.c, src/librt/nmg_mk.c, src/librt/nmg_rt_segs.c, src/librt/prep.c, src/librt/tree.c:
	missing stddef.h for offsetof, convert references to offsetof to bu_offsetof

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c: missing stdlib.h for atol

	* src/libbu/hash.c:
	include stdlib.h for malloc (cannot use bu_malloc() as the hash table may be used for MEM_DEBUG)

	* src/libbu/cmd.c: ws

	* src/libbn/bn_tcl.c: common file size uses longs now

	* src/libbu/vfont.c: use bu_malloc instead of malloc

	* src/libbu/malloc.c, src/libbu/semaphore.c:
	missing stdlib.h for malloc (only a few files that should be using malloc instead of bu_malloc)

	* src/mged/fbserv.c: remove pkgtypes.h

	* src/mged/fbserv.h: add header protection, include fbmsg.h

	* NEWS: ws

	* src/fbserv/Makefile.am:
	include server.c, moved from src/libfb to there

	* src/fbserv/fbserv.c, src/fbserv/fbserv_win.c:
	declare the fb_server_pkg_switch server callback switch table provided in server.c

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am:
	server.c was moved to src/fbserv/.; pkgswitch.c was removed entirely; pkgtypes.h was renamed to fbmsg.h and moved to include/.

	* src/libfb/if_remote.c:
	use fbmsg.h instead of pkgtypes.h (renamed and moved)

	* src/libfb/Attic/pkgswitch.c:
	remove used switch file, seems like a dumbed down example of the fbserv switch table with just close and error.  not really useful.

	* include/fb.h:
	by moving the framebuffer server switch table out of libfb and into fbserv directly, it no longer needs to be in fb.h, removing the fb.h interface coupling to pkg.h

	* include/Makefile.am:
	add fbmsg.h to the list of headers (but make it noinst)

	* src/fbserv/server.c, src/libfb/Attic/server.c:
	moved src/libfb/server.c to src/fbserv/server.c; the file contains the fbserv callbacks and the callback table used exclusively by fbserv.

	* src/libfb/fbserv_obj.c, src/libfb/fbserv_obj_win32.c:
	change from HIDDEN to static, ws, use fbmsg.h

	* include/fbmsg.h, src/libfb/Attic/pkgtypes.h:
	moved/renamed src/libfb/pkgtypes.h to include/fbmsg.h as it is used both by the library (if_remote) and by the application (fbserv) for communicating; whether it's considered a public header or a private header that fbserv happens to understand is still up for debate

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c, include/pkg.h:
	there is no need/intent to modify the pkg_switch callback structure, so make it const

Sat Jan 21 21:09:44 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/g-acad.c, src/conv/g-dxf.c, src/conv/g-euclid.c, src/conv/g-euclid1.c, src/conv/g-nff.c, src/conv/g-nmg.c, src/conv/g-stl.c, src/conv/g-tankill.c, src/conv/g-vrml.c, src/conv/g-x3d.c, src/conv/g-xxx_facets.c:
	a little less excitement about regions that evaluate to nothing, still report it if we're verbose a little more consistently.

	* src/conv/g-nmg.c: ah, r may be null from td_r when traversing

	* src/mged/cmd.c: er, if BC_WITH_PARSERS is NOT defined..

	* configure.ac:
	add tests to determine whether we successfully found a system bison/flex yacc/lex tool pair for making parsers.  if either isn't found, the parsers that are written to utilize them are disabled to prevent compile errors and a warning is output.  if they are availabe WITH_PARSERS is provided to the makefiles and BC_WITH_PARSERS is defined for code to conditionally test against.

	* src/mged/Makefile.am:
	conditionally traverse into and link against the points subdirectory based on whether WITH_PARSERS was declared by configure after testing for yacc/lex.

	* src/mged/cmd.c:
	disable the parse_points command conditionally depending on new configure checks for yacc/lex, output a message if it was disabled

	* configure.ac:
	use AC_PROG_LEX instead of AM_PROG_LEX since the latter attempts to use the missing script to run flex but fails miserably due to the assumptions by automake that LEX_OUTPUT_ROOT will be set to something.

	* src/libfb/fbserv_obj.c:
	pkgtypes.h is in current dir, no need to couple to the directory name

	* src/libfb/Attic/pkgswitch.c: pkg.h isn't a local header

	* include/fb.h:
	framebuffer interface is presently tied to the network package library due to a return type, should decouple that

	* NEWS:
	Forgot to mention that considerable time was spent profiling and
	optimizing the raytracer.  in particular, performance enhancements
	were made in support of reducing large image overhead and some
	unnecessary pixel processing.  this is particularly important for
	background pixels, i.e. primary rays that miss the model.  performance
	observed varies based on number of primary rays and the number that
	miss, but results show anywhere from 5% (small "full" images) to 300%
	increase (large "empty" images):

	For example, shooting at a single sphere on a viewsize of 100000 at a
	10kx10k pixel image, increase shows:

	Before:  about 700,000 rtfms
	 After:about 2,200,000 rtfms

	Benchmark results increased consistently from about 2120 to 2270 on
	one machine (mac g5), which seems reasonable given their relatively
	tiny size and general lack of background.  shark made profiling fun.

	* NEWS:
	mention the name of the new root solving application, roots_example.

	* Makefile.am:
	delete any CVS directories from our candidate distribution since we don't want to ship them

	* misc/Makefile.am:
	scratch that, the test will be moved to the top-level makefile so NO cvs dirs get included

	* misc/Makefile.am:
	don't include enigma's CVS directory in the distribution

	* NEWS: 7.8 will likely be released in february

	* NEWS: oops, put roots_example into the right release block

	* NEWS: new example root solving sample application

	* src/util/.cvsignore: ignore the roots_example binary

	* src/util/Makefile.am:
	add roots_example.c as a sample application that uses the root solver

	* src/util/roots_example.c:
	might as well add a linear root example too, fix type on rt_poly_roots()

	* src/util/roots_example.c:
	add a simple example application that shows how to use the root solver for solving polynomial roots (up to 4th order shown)

	* src/libbu/mappedfile.c:
	cast the time_t to a long so we don't need to necessarily stash a time_t in the mappedfile structure any more

	* include/bu.h:
	remove the unnecessary time_t type from the public header so that the dependency on time.h may be eliminated

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/brlcad.rc: update copyright to 2006

	* src/librt/librt.dsp: set HAVE_CONFIG_H to get internal declarations,
	db_flags.c, db_inmem.c added

	* misc/win32-msvc/Dll/brlcad.dsp, src/libbn/libbn.dsp, src/libbu/libbu.dsp, src/libsysv/libsysv.dsp, src/libwdb/libwdb.dsp:
	set HAVE_CONFIG_H to get internal declarations

Fri Jan 20 02:05:08 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/liboptical/Makefile.am:
	heh, fPIC breaks irix compiler (they use DPIC)

	* src/librt/db_inmem.c: unused var

Thu Jan 19 16:00:19 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Minor tweaks to the _invoke_wizard_update and _init_obj_edit_view methods.

Thu Jan 19 15:34:33 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/tkimg/base/Makefile.am: missing trailing slash

	* m4/epsilon.m4:
	while it's bizarre for them to be different, only report a failure to conform if the implementation is epsilon is less than the expected power

	* TODO: justin's idea of a librt-based path tracer is pretty cool

	* TODO:
	system identifier application with sysctl-style information database

	* TODO:
	support for features either as primitives or operations or both, e.g. chamfer, fillet, round

	* TODO:
	mingw is once again delayed a release, archer rises to the list for the current distribution

	* src/archer/archer:
	have archer search the current directory for tclscripts in case we're not installed

	* src/bwish/main.c:
	modify the auto_path as soon as we have the tcl interpreter so that even resources like tk.tcl may be found when mixing system/non-system tcl with other system/non-system components

	* configure.ac:
	search for the tcl/tk stub libraries too, and utilize them accordingly if someone asks for a system tcl or tk.  for now, presume that tcl+tclstub and tk+tkstub always exist together or at least that it'll link regardless.

Wed Jan 18 21:04:51 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/copyright.sh:
	convert/update the copyright script from a BSD sed using the -E option for extended regular expressions (an option which the GNU sed doesn't recognize).  convert the sed expressions to basic regular expressions instead so it works with either without needing to test sed for option support or limiting to one versus the other.

Mon Jan 16 23:37:13 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS: fixed brlman/awf `./"' unsupported or unknown issue

	* BUGS: our awf now supports ./" comments in addition to .\" ones

	* src/other/awf/pass2.base: support ./" and .\" as an awf comment

	* TODO: wrote the .g in-memory transfer example aplication

	* include/raytrace.h:
	add declarations for the new routines in db_inmem.c and db_flags.c, namely db_open_inmem, db_create_inmem, and db_flags_raw_internal

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	switch it back to db_open_inmem() instead of db_create_inmem() since testing is done, either should work fine but for this application, we don't need the _GLOBAL.

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	rename the dbip global to DBIP to distinguish it from local function dbip pointers.  move the open/create/flag inmem routines into librt proper into the db_inmem.c and db_flags.c files.

	* src/librt/Makefile.am: add db_flags.c and db_inmem.c

	* src/librt/db_inmem.c, src/librt/db_lookup.c:
	begin consolidating the in-memory-only database geometry support into one plcae.  move db_inmem() to its own db_inmem.c file, adding two new routines for opening/creating in-memory databases via db_open_inmem() and db_create_inmem().  difference between the two being that create adds a _GLOBAL while open does not.

	* src/librt/db_alloc.c, src/librt/db_flags.c:
	move the db_flags_internal() to its own db_flags.c file as it has very little to do with allocations. also, add another routine for getting the flags from a db5_raw_internal as well.

	* src/librt/db5_io.c:
	protect from loosing memory and from otherwise potentially freeing what we are about to dup by stashing the pointer then freeing it.

	* src/gtools/.cvsignore: ignore g_transfer

	* NEWS: new g_transfer in-memory geometry example program

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	now fully working, shooting rays at the remote geometry being held in-memory only.  finishing polish fixes that were needed include making the dbi_title memory dynamic so librt doesn't try to free the static string, do the something during the ciao instead of after the server shuts down, and MOST IMPORTANTLY .. don't free the libpkg buf buffer that was used to set the external buffer, that gets stashed into the directory pointer, that must not be free'd when we try to use it...(that took a long time to find)

	* src/librt/prep.c:
	quell a warning after repeat calls to rt_clean() since the rti_nsol_by_type wasn't getting set to zero when the memory was released.  now it checks for the zero param to bu_free and clears the nsol value.

	* src/librt/tree.c:
	stash the node into an argv for rt_gettree() so that it may be null-padded.  helps debugging to see the boundary.

Sun Jan 15 23:49:36 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/db5_io.c:
	missing curlies, so wrong message was getting printed on bad objects.

	* src/librt/db_io.c: ws

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	ack, make sure the file pointer isn't null before trying to fclose it

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	give the server something to do with the geometry sent to it -- the client can specify objects that should be shot at via MSG_ARGS packets.  the server stashes those object names and then shoots a ray at them when the client disconnects.  since external packets actually include their data lengths inside, we don't need to send that object length as a string.  server now correctly stashes the geometry as in-memory objects.

	* configure.ac:
	add header checks for ieeefp.h, setjmp.h, and waitflags.h for the blt package, also add function checks for finite() and isfinit() from libm and a sizeof test for long long.

	* src/other/blt/src/bltTree.c:
	there seem to be two macro names missing for systems where sizeof_void_p is 8 (MAX_LIST_VALUES and START_LOGSIZE) so move their defines outside the #if so everyone gets it.

	* src/other/blt/Makefile.am:
	their configure indicated they need socket, m, and nsl, so add them

	* autogen.sh:
	fix a problem where the an aborted autogen.sh would leave a configure.ac.backup and a subsequent failing autoconf would restore the wrong/old backup.  only restore if we made the backup.

	* configure.ac:
	add the new BC_COMPLIANT_FLOAT and BC_COMPLIANT_DOUBLE tests

	* m4/epsilon.m4:
	add BC_COMPLIANT_FLOAT and BC_COMPLIANT_DOUBLE for determining whether the floating point implementation seems to be IEEE 754 compliant.  a handful of tests are performed, namely checking that the epsilon tolerance matches the defined power, making sure 0 == -0, and that -0 is actually implemented.

	* configure.ac:
	run AC_C_BIGENDIAN without overriding the if-true and if-false so that the regular WORDS_BIGENDIAN define is provided (added for blt, which relies on it).  test for size of int and long so that the result is logged for debugging.  add checks to determine the floating point epsilon values too.

	* m4/Makefile.am, m4/epsilon.m4:
	new m4/epsilon.m4 file.  define macros BC_TRY_RUN_OUTPUT, BC_FLOAT_EPSILON, and BC_DOUBLE_EPSILON.  BC_TRY_RUN_OUTPUT attempts to compile and run the provided program, saving the output in the provided variable.  this makes for really convenient tests that can output a calculated value (like computation tolerances).  The latter two respectively determine the floating point tolerance epsilon value (i.e. smallest value such that 1.0 + value != 1.0).  ANSI defines macros that should be provided, but they are sometimes not.

	* m4/compiler.m4: meh

Sat Jan 14 03:22:09 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/rt/rtshot.c:
	use rt_gettrees_and_attrs instead of rt_gettrees_muves.  the latter is a special hook routine provided to muves (though why rt_gettrees_and_attrs wasn't sufficient is a mystery to me).  the abstraction does keep them ever so slightly decoupled, but brl-cad code shouldn't be calling it even if rtshot was initially perhaps an example for them.

Fri Jan 13 18:24:29 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Add better support for toggling display of primitive labels when Archer is embedded.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/images/aboutArcher.png: Update to 0.7.3

	* src/tclscripts/archer/ShaderEdit.tcl:
	Add code to possibly call the (-shaderChangedCallback) from the changedShader method.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Modify the packTree method to ignore malformed lines. Add call to _refresh_tree to _apply_edit and _reset_edit

Thu Jan 12 23:41:52 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	fix AND improve the adrt checks.  some variables had changed (making them wrong) for testing sdl/python; they're now fixed.  add an --enable-adrt option that is coupled to the --with-sdl and --with-python options including all the additional checks for making sure all the various combinations make sense or output messages or abort.  before doing any BC_RETRY_CONFIGURE, output a message as to why we are retrying.  sdl test only needs to check for sdl-config if sdl is actuallly going to be used, same for python.  make the jove test consistent with the other tests.

	* src/other/blt/src/Makefile.am:
	shouldn't need module or static for this library, move CPPHEADERS to the top, don't install the blt config.h files, install the rest of the headers

	* src/other/blt/Makefile.am:
	shouldn't need module, don't link the tk sources

	* src/other/blt/src/bltConfig.h:
	just make blt use brl-cad's common.h for config.h results

	* src/other/libtcl/Makefile.am, src/other/libtcl/generic/Makefile.am, src/other/libtcl/unix/Makefile.am:
	move the AM_CPPFLAGS up to the top

Thu Jan 12 21:03:17 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Add the ability to toggle display of primitive labels.

Thu Jan 12 21:01:56 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/blt/src/bltGrAxis.c, src/other/blt/src/bltGrElem.c, src/other/blt/src/bltGrMarker.c, src/other/blt/src/bltInit.c, src/other/blt/src/bltTreeView.c:
	apply blt2.4z-patch-2

Thu Jan 12 15:48:07 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/g-stl.c: The -i option doesn't take an argument.

Thu Jan 12 06:01:54 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO: sgi dial knobs should be working release after next

	* TODO:
	add callback data parameteres to libpkg hook functions so one doesn't have to use global data

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	begin initial support for creating an in-memory geometry database (routines will likely move into librt, but here for now for simplicity (db_open_inmem() and db_create_inmem()).  also send the length of each object over the wire as an ascii string for simplicity so we can easily restore the bu_external structure without going through hoops.  add an rt_init_resource() call for convenience until the next release since db_open() is bugged on earlier versions.

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c:
	quell braindead compiler warning on altix where strerror_r is declared to return a char * (gnu glibc extension) instead of an int (posix, bsd, c89, svid3) like it's supposed to.

Wed Jan 11 22:45:23 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/db_io.c: ws

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	clean up db_create()'s logic considerably.  annoyingly, the version check for writing out the ident can't go away since db_fwrite_ident() has no means to determine the version (need some wrapper interface)

	* src/librt/db5_io.c:
	correctly free our allocated resources in db5_fwrite_ident() even on fatal error by stashing the result.

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	remove dead init line, dbi_eof is set to something else two lines after.

	* src/librt/dir.c: heh, wrong line and bad syntax.. never mind

	* src/librt/dir.c: init mat to NULL before checking if it's null.

	* src/librt/db_open.c:
	prevent a segfault if caller provides a null mode to db_open()

Wed Jan 11 16:36:31 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Modify the _apply_edit method to not call _refresh_tree.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/ShaderEdit.tcl:
	Arrange to call the shader changed callback when editing the shader form.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	The edit panels are no longer using Scrolledframes. Modify _select_node method to always update the edit panel. _reset_edit no longer calls _refresh_tree

Tue Jan 10 22:40:39 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/GeometryEditFrame.tcl:
	Mods to NOT use Scrolledframe

	* src/tclscripts/archer/tclIndex: Update index

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Add the following methods: packTree, unpackTree and unpackTreeGuts

	* src/tclscripts/archer/ShaderEdit.tcl: Initial check-in

	* src/tclscripts/archer/CombEditFrame.tcl:
	Add better support for boolean editing and shader editing. More mods to follow.

Tue Jan 10 07:29:20 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c: free our buffers

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	yes, libpkg does rock.  send the geometry to the server properly specifying callbacks for the different packet types.  server gets a simple processing loop to read in the data and handle the packets.

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	libpkg is pretty cool.  open a connnection from the client to the server using a really simple handshake protocol.  client sends HELO, server listens for that HELO to distinguish valid clients from bogus connnections.

Mon Jan  9 23:10:50 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	instead of two separate hook funcs, just use send_to_server() for both the specified geometry case and the non-specified geometry case.

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	get rid of the db_walk_tree method since db_functree is considerably more simple for this purpose. stash the server details into our data struct.

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	commit a version that walks the specified geometry both with db_walk_tree() and db_functree().  db_functree was ultimately considerably more simple for this exercise, but useful to see what was provided with db_walk_tree and the differences. add support to run the client either passing all geometry or just a subset (hence the subtree walking)

Sun Jan  8 19:33:21 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	add an optional geometry argument for specifying what geometry to send (default is all); add a help option and make short options case insensitive

Fri Jan  6 15:55:37 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* HACKING:
	additional release may be made on an as-needed basis for bug-fix releases and security issues.  December/January time frame is considered a single release iteration in order to accommodate holidays and vacations, and to give the devs a break.

	* TODO: new geometry examples aren't going to happen this iteration

	* src/gtools/Makefile.am:
	add the new g_transfer.c file to the build including the creation of the g_transfer example database application for transferring portions of a .g over the wire serialized.

	* src/gtools/g_transfer.c:
	initial stubbed g_transfer example application for transferring portions of a geometry database over a network line serialized.  incomplete, but provides the main organization.

	* src/librt/db5_scan.c:
	init the rt_uniresource structure if it hasn't been initialized yet so that we can call db_dirbuild() directly without necessarily needing to worry about initializing a resource structure.  this mimicks the behavior and initialization that rt_dirbuild() performas as well.

	* src/fb/fb-bw.c: flubber fubber

Thu Jan  5 22:40:13 2006  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS: added reshoot notice.

	* src/rt/reshoot.1, src/rt/reshoot.c:
	extended documentation, code formatting, modified reporting

	* src/rt/reshoot.c: better output formatting

	* src/rt/reshoot.1:
	Added a "BUGS" section with suitable caveats for precision loss

	* src/rt/reshoot.1, src/rt/reshoot.c:
	This is an application for re-shooting rays and comparing the results
	to previous applicatin runs.  The princiiple use will probably be
	in the regression test suite.  In that context, it should allow us
	to shoot all the MUVES test suite rays outside of MUVES.  The one downside
	is that it relies on the RT_G_DEBUG flag DEBUG_ALLHITS to cause librt
	to log the original rays.  Since floating point values are logged with %g some
	precision is lost.

Thu Jan  5 16:48:20 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/archer/archer:
	All of archer including the tclscripts is assigned to u.s. government and should be under the LGPL

Wed Jan  4 22:04:56 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/footer.sh, sh/header.sh:
	add support for DOS batch script files, using REM as the comment

Wed Jan  4 21:34:07 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/swidgets/scripts/tree.itk: Check-in for Doug Howard.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl, src/tclscripts/lib/ComboBox.tcl:
	Minor cleanup.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/ColorEntry.tcl:
	Modified to use tk_chooseColor. Other minor cleanup.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Command.tcl:
	Add back door for accessing the master interpreter (i.e. the Command widget uses a slave interpreter for interfacing with the user). Other minor mods.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Db.tcl:
	Change the help for erotate, escale and etranslate to orotate, oscale and otranslate, respectively.

	* src/fbserv/Makefile.am, src/other/tkimg/base/Makefile.am, src/other/tkimg/png/Makefile.am, src/other/tkimg/pngtcl/Makefile.am, src/other/tkimg/zlibtcl/Makefile.am, src/other/tkimg/Makefile.am:
	Add to EXTRA_DIST for Windows

Wed Jan  4 16:01:16 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/fb/fb-bw.1: add support for -F framebuffer option to fb-bw

Wed Jan  4 16:00:55 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/libpng/Makefile.am: Add scripts to EXTRA_DIST

	* src/other/libtcl/Makefile.am: Add win to EXTRA_DIST

Wed Jan  4 15:59:14 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS, src/fb/fb-bw.c: add support for -F framebuffer option to fb-bw

Wed Jan  4 15:55:10 2006  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/Makefile.am, src/libsysv/Makefile.am:
	Add to EXTRA_DIST for Windows

	* src/other/blt/win/Makefile.am, src/other/blt/demos/Makefile.am, src/other/blt/demos/bitmaps/Makefile.am:
	Initial check-in

	* src/other/blt/src/Makefile.am: Add EXTRA_DIST for Windows

	* src/other/blt/Makefile.am:
	Add EXTRA_DIST. Also add demos and win to SURDIRS.

	* configure.ac: Add more blt dirs to AC_CONFIG_FILES

Wed Jan  4 05:41:33 2006  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libfb/if_ogl_win32.c:
	no sense using saveifp in a function that provides the ifp

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c: there is no saveifp, should be ifp

	* src/other/iwidgets/pkgIndex.tcl:
	meh, shouldn't be in cvs, but update to 7.7.0 anyways

Mon Jan  2 18:16:44 2006  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	add searches for itcl32 and itk32, as FreeBSD removes the dot

Sat Dec 31 02:19:09 2005  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/common.h:
	do not include our config.h header in common.h if common has been installed (our public header files shouldn't be using config defines anyways).  this will undoubtedly require more testing, but it makes it such that 3rd party developers don't necessarily need to include /usr/brlcad/include or use -DHAVE_CONFIG_H to get the header to simply work

	* src/rt/rtexample.c:
	add more comments on what the file is and its purpose, fix the compile example so that it works on an installed brl-cad too

	* src/rt/Makefile.am:
	add the rtcheck_vers_win.c rtedge_vers_win.c that were added from the windows port branch so they are included in the dist

	* TODO:
	add support to restore the backups when an autogen.sh step aborts

	* src/conv/iges/Makefile.am:
	add the missing g-iges-vers_win.c iges-g-vers_win.c windows vers.c files to the dist

	* TODO:
	don't have access to intel compiler so reprioritize the benchmark testing to a later release.

	* configure.ac:
	rename --enable-everything to --enable-almost-everything just to keep things more truthful, yet keep the original as an alias.  make jove and the proe-plugin have a -build by default to be consistent with the other provided packages, exand on the proe plugin aliases.

Fri Dec 30 23:45:14 2005  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	consistent case on BLT and tkImg when printing the name of the package, order them after iwidgets for each section.

	* configure.ac:
	make tcl, itcl, iwidgets and the new blt and tkimg packages all default to 'auto' for determining whether to use/install them; fix the aliases for the two new packages and put their result output in the right place.

	* src/rt/rtarea.1:
	credit/blame me since rtarea was almost entirely rewritten when adding presented/exposed areas

	* configure.ac: misc/win32-msvc7/Makefile listed twice

	* src/gtools/g_qa.c: quantitative analysis instead of quality assurance

	* src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	added standard legalese file header, converted to bu_getopt for portability, increased max title length stored

	* NEWS:
	reid mged command, recursively assign region IDs; remat mged command, recursively assign a material ID; get_regions mged command, list assembly regions

	* src/tclscripts/mged/e_id.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/openw.tcl: ws

	* src/tclscripts/mged/raypick.tcl, src/tclscripts/mged/solclick.tcl:
	add the script name to the error message when searching for the commands the script uses

	* src/tclscripts/mged/Makefile.am:
	add reid.tcl and remat.tcl, re-add the mysteriously commented pkgIndex.tcl

	* src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl:
	add help data for reid, get_regions, and remat

	* src/tclscripts/mged/remat.tcl:
	add a remat command to mged.  remat assigns material IDs to all regions under some assembly to some given material ID number

	* src/tclscripts/mged/reid.tcl:
	add a new reid and get_regions command to mged.  reid assigns region IDs to all regions under some assembly starting at some given region ID number.  get_regions is used by reid to obtain the names of regions under a given combination.

	* TODO:
	before next release: test intel compiler performance on Altix, add performance options

	* TODO: windows branch is merged

Thu Dec 29 20:19:47 2005  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl: Add the "Compact" file menu item.

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Command.tcl:
	Utilize a slave interpreter for better command/script parsing.

Thu Dec 29 15:16:08 2005  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/sdialogs/.cvsignore, src/tclscripts/swidgets/.cvsignore:
	ignore generated tclIndex and pkgIndex.tcl scripts

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am, src/liboptical/Makefile.am, src/libpkg/Makefile.am, src/librt/Makefile.am, src/libsysv/Makefile.am, src/libtclcad/Makefile.am, src/libwdb/Makefile.am, src/mged/Makefile.am, src/nirt/Makefile.am, src/rt/Makefile.am, src/libbn/Makefile.am, src/libbu/Makefile.am, src/libdm/Makefile.am:
	missing the vers_win.c files for making source distributions that will compile on windows

	* README, configure.ac, include/config_win.h:
	next release is going to be 7.8.0 given all the major enhancements, so bump revision up to 7.7.0

	* NEWS:
	these need a LOT more detail, but it's something.  new Archer modeling and visualization tool - Bob Parker, Doug Howard; extensive Windows build support enhancements - Bob Parker.  this isn't close to a patch update, 7.7.0 it becomes

	* configure.ac:
	generate the Makefiles for all of the new win32_msvc7 project dirs

	* misc/Makefile.am: traverse into the win32-msvc7 dir

	* misc/win32-msvc7/tclstub/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/tkimg/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/tkimgpng/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/tkstub/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/wish/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/png2fb/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/rt/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/rtcheck/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/rtedge/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/stl2g/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/tclpipe/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/tclsh/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libtcl/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libtclcad/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libtk/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libwdb/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libz/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/mged/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/nirt/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/pix2fb/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libpkg/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libpng/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/librt/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libsysv/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/itkstub/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libBLT/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libItcl/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libItk/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libbn/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libbu/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libdm/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/libfb/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/liboptical/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/g2asc/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/g2iges/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/g2stl/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/iges2g/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/itclstub/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/fb2pix/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/fb2png/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/fbclear/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/fbserv/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/asc2g/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/brlcad/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/dbupgrade/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/fast42g/Makefile.am, misc/win32-msvc7/all/Makefile.am:
	add the automake templates for all of the studio projects so that they are included in source distributions.

	* configure.ac, misc/win32-msvc7/Makefile.am:
	add an automake makefile for the new win32_msvc7 directory so that it will get included in source distributions, traverse through it even

	* src/libfb/if_remote.c:
	use the HAVE_NETINET_IN_H header define instead of !_WIN32

	* src/libfb/if_ogl.c:
	copy some of the event/alive checking that was added to if_ogl_win32.c for the if_ogl.c interface too.

	* src/Makefile.am: ws

	* src/archer/Makefile.am, src/archer/plugins/Wizards/Makefile.am, src/archer/plugins/Wizards/tankwizardIA/Makefile.am, src/archer/plugins/Wizards/tankwizardIA/images/Makefile.am:
	add the maintainercleanfiles sections, an rcs id, and the venerable Makefile.defs for consistency

	* src/archer/plugins/Makefile.am:
	missing utility.tcl, add maintainercleanfiles and the Makefile.defs include

	* src/archer/archer:
	add support to archer for running without necesssarily being installed yet

	* include/fb.h:
	avoid including sys/select.h outright since it conflicts on some systems (e.g. fbsd4).  would be good to decouple fb's interface from the fd_set struct since it's only used in one place

	* configure.ac: finish the sentence

	* configure.ac:
	add a check to test whether we ended up with POSIX threading if only primarily to have the hint in the config.log output.  the pthread test was found in gd's configure.ac and seems a reasonable fairely comprehensive test.  pthread_cleanup_push is reportedly non-functional stub function on solaris; pthread_create and pthread_join are not necessarily in the same lib on irix (even though we prefer sproc on irix for performance); pthread_attr_init is apparently bonked on dec too.

	* README:
	remove the outdated warning about libtool 1.5 since autogen.sh works around the problem now

Wed Dec 28 23:32:39 2005  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/liboptical/Makefile.am:
	libtool on fbsd/amd64 seems to not use fPIC on this, causing breakage due
	to non-relocatable code in libmultispectral. This seems to fix it, and
	shouldn't damage other platforms.

Wed Dec 28 17:09:16 2005  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/mged.bat, src/archer/archer.bat:
	Added code to set the BRLCAD_DATA environment variable.

Tue Dec 27 19:26:46 2005  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/tkimg/base/Attic/Makefile.in:
	don't need Makefile.in files in CVS when there are Makefile.am files

	* src/other/libtcl/unix/dltest/Attic/Makefile.in:
	got rid of the other tcl Makefile.in files, might as well get rid of this one too

	Update the project settings (release only)

	* src/conv/iges/g-iges-vers_win.c, src/conv/iges/iges-g-vers_win.c:
	This was missed during the merge because the iges directory was moved.

Thu Dec 22 21:31:12 2005  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO: pix-png should make sure output is not to a terminal

	* src/rt/worker.c:
	rewrite do_pixel() for a 30% performance enhancement on an model-less scene. this results in a savings of 5-30% time depending on model complexity/size.  the performance is gained by removing some rediculous memory copying into temporaries and optimizing away several divisions and modulos.  the main loop is also unrolled one iteration since the default case does not involve hypersampling. also rework the logic on testing whether a pixmap (previous results render) is being used since considerable time was spent testing each pixel even when a pixmap wasn't being used.  most of these optimizations were performed based on Shark profiler results on OS X of rendering a large empty image. there are still a plethora of cpu stalls that should be fixable with compiler alignment directives

	* src/rt/do.c:
	make sure pixmap is null before wiping it out.  instead of setting all the elements to zero, save cpu cycles and just request a bu_calloc...

	* src/librt/shoot.c:
	only test the debug flags extensively if something in run-time debug is enabled

	* NEWS, configure.ac: prepare for release, 7.6.6
d320 5
a324 2
	* NEWS:
	significant AUTHORS file updates, all names filed.. only taken me over a year to get to this point but it feels good to give credit where credit is deserved
d326 2
a327 2
	* AUTHORS:
	WOO HOO, no more names to be filed.. there may be a few names that still need to get credited, but the list is considerably more comprehensive now.  could use more work on the chronological ordering and perhaps some indication of years in the file itself, but it's a good start.
d329 2
a330 2
	* AUTHORS:
	special thanks goes out to charles stanley for his support of the package in the development of mged.  charles/chuck is listed in the historic documentation, but is not authored on any of the files -- managerial support in a similar vein as deitz perhaps, though his participation does seem to go far back to near the start of the project
d332 2
a333 2
	* AUTHORS:
	special thanks to william sebok for his fast Princeton memory allocater routines that john added to libbu as pmalloc.c in 1997 with some modifications.
d335 2
a336 2
	* AUTHORS:
	brant ross wrote the FrameBuffer library interface for Raster Technology One/80 (libfb's if_rat.c), fairly significant coding contribution
d338 1
a338 2
	* AUTHORS:
	special thanks to f. kenton musgrave and robert skinner for algorithm support in the perlin-style noise function and height field primitive (Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing for Height Fields paper)
d340 2
a341 2
	* AUTHORS:
	Martin, Glenn E. and Willson, Stephen Hunter of the Northrup Research and Technology Center worked with Mike on the Tektronix 4109 device driver display manager interface circa 1986 according to cvs logs.  credit them with special thanks.

	* AUTHORS:
	joe johnson worked with steve satterfield on the Lyon-Lamb VAS IV video animation controller (vas4) code .. should probably be in code contributions, need to revisi more carefully later. maybe have a talk with steve first.
d346 1
a346 2
	* AUTHORS:
	daniel dender was involed in the 3.0->4.x days minimally and has code credited to his name in mged (facedef.c) as well as the patch-g converter, so attribute him appropriately into the coding contributions section.  he was also actively involved on the old mailing list.
d348 1

d353 2
a354 2
	* AUTHORS:
	Spencer, Thomas W.; McKie, Jim; Davies, Steve; Turkowski, Ken; Woods, James A.; Orost, Joseph; all added with special thanks for the (indirect) contributions to the package.   in particular, they all worked on the code 'compress.c' that serves as the basis for out libfb compression, added by chris johnson in 1991.  the code was derived from software contributed to Berkeley by James A. Woods, derived from original work by Spencer Thomas and Joseph Orost.  Spencer Thomas in particular is also listed in other places throughout the package for his work on the RLE code at the University of Utah.
d356 2
a357 2
	* AUTHORS:
	david becker provided vectorized implementations of the shot routines for several of the primitives.  the qualifies as a significant coding contribution.  his placement in the time ordering might not be right, but CVS log shows he contributed circa 1988/1989
d359 2
a360 2
	* regress/Makefile.am:
	the regression tests should run regardless of the output files.  in fact, start by cleaning out the directory first so we're always at a known starting state.  have each test output when it's complete and a message at the end to indicate that testing was completed successfully
d363 1

a410 1
	* AUTHORS: As reported directly from George Hartwig, Jr.:
d412 2
a413 1
	"In the late 70's Dr Bruce Henriksen and Dr Stephen Wolff were trying to bring BRL into the world of multi-user computing and as a part of this process bought a PDP 11/70 computer, a variety of terminals and Mike Muuss to install a version of JHU Unix.  Early in this experiment Mike wrote a plotting package called Terminal Independent Graphics so that things could be plotted to terminals, primarily the HP2648A, and printers, again primarily Versatexs. This package was used as part of a chain of programs that were 'piped' together."
d415 2
a416 1
	Basically, special thanks go to Dr. Wolff and Dr. Henriksen for enabling Mike to get started on BRL-CAD, providing resources and support presumably from a managerial level in the very very early days of BRL-CAD.
d418 2
a419 1
	* NEWS: fixed sketch primitive bezier path computation bug
d421 1
a421 2
	* src/libtclcad/tkCanvBezier.c:
	simple check to prevent infinite recursion on complex bezier paths
d423 1
a423 1
	* NEWS: cleaned up erroneous rtedge end of line output
d425 2
a426 2
	* src/rt/viewedge.c:
	the rewrite to allow output to both a file and a framebuffer simultaneously overlooked the else that attempted to test neither file nor framebuffer.  fix output blather of 'strange, no end of line actions taken'
d428 2
a429 2
	* src/libbu/vls.c:
	make sure the supposedly valid vls string pointer is actually allocated some space before trying to free it on the offchance that the magic was set and no space was allocated yet.
d431 2
a432 2
	* src/libbn/tplot.c:
	ansify PL_FORTRAN, ws, style consistency, commentification.
d434 1
a434 1
Tue Dec 13 22:20:53 2005  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>
d436 2
a437 2
	* src/mged/cmd.c:
	revert back to a non-pointer bu_vls so we're not calling bu_vls_init() on a NULL pointer.  bu_vls_init() was updated to allow multiple init statements
d439 1
a439 2
	* src/libbu/vls.c:
	if bu_vls_init is called on a vls that already has space allocated, be sure to free that space before wiping out the pointer to prevent memory leaks and safely allow multiple init calls
d441 2
a442 2
	* AUTHORS:
	adam ross was really a full developer, even through GSI, given the quantity and level of his changes and contributions so credit him appropriately.  time-wise, that slots him around chris johnson and mike markowski.  markowski confirmed that he started during BRL and that he doesn't mind his e-mail being added. jra is still active.
d444 1
a444 2
	* src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	irix fix, can only declare variables at the start of a scope block in c89
d447 9
a455 1
	add a section for both the current and next release iteration items.  mged path foo should be fixed, relegate clone/tracker, windows branch, and new geometry to the next release iteration
d457 1
a457 1
	* NEWS: added an --enable/disable-everything option to configure
d459 1
a459 2
	* src/mged/mater.c:
	color_putrec only works on v4 databases as it ends up calling db_diradd, so say so
d461 1
a461 2
	* src/librt/Attic/fast.sh, src/mged/Attic/fast.sh, src/libbu/Attic/fast.sh:
	remove the ancient fast.sh 'fast' build scripts, the make fast rule trumps
d463 48
a510 2
	* src/mged/clone.c:
	increment in steps of 100 instead of the previous 500 -- not likely to have 100 objects being cloned together; replace the dist function with the vmath.h DIST_PT_PT macro; add comments out the wazoo for what's going on; provide the correct minor_type for db_diradd(); add some sanity checks and debug printing; convert all the string manipulations to be strncmp, strncpy, etc (though they should be just bu_vls strings)
d513 18
a530 1
	the Tcl_Interp *interp global is moved to ged.c since it's prevalent to all of mged; remove the PATH modification, moving it into mged_setup() (now in setup.c)
d532 1
a532 2
	* src/mged/ged.h:
	declare the mged_view_obj_callback() and the Tcl_Interp *interp global so that they are available elsewhere
d534 38
a571 2
	* src/mged/cmd.c:
	move mged_setup() to it's own file setup.h.; make the tcl_output_hook static since it's not needed anywhere else; move the Tcl_Interp interp global to ged.c
d573 2
a574 1
	* src/mged/Makefile.am: add setup.c, containing mged_setup() from cmd.c
d576 1
a576 2
	* src/mged/setup.c:
	separate mged_setup() into it's own file, adding/fixing the block for modifying the PATH for finding brl-cad resources that match the running mged -- it must come before the tcl init routines for it to match tcl's internal env tracking
d578 2
a579 1
Mon Dec 12 23:41:44 2005  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>
d581 1
a581 2
	* src/librt/dir.c:
	avoid crashing, only call the internal free routine if the internal pointer is valid/set
d583 1
a583 2
	* src/librt/db_comb.c:
	allow rt_comb_ifree to continue even if the comb pointer, i.e. the object's internal resource pointer is not (yet) set.
d585 2
a586 1
	* bench/run.sh: report the LOG setting
d588 1
a588 2
	* autogen.sh:
	instead of not even trying autoreconf on a configuration where it's well known to not work (e.g. mac os x), give it a try anyways but with a little more explanation.  perhaps raise awareness of broken configurations.
d590 2
a591 1
	* configure.ac: check for setenv
d593 1
a593 1
Fri Dec  9 05:35:56 2005  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>
d595 2
a596 2
	* AUTHORS:
	Tom DiGiacinto's contribution dates back to 1988 at least with Mike attributing the sh_stxt.c solid texture map shader to him as the author.  there are references to his name also in conjunction with the marble shader (which also implies the camo shader) in the cvs logs.
d598 1
a598 2
	* AUTHORS:
	traced down george hartwig jr. contributions down to src/libbn/tplot.c which dates back to 1979(!), seeming from a fortran code that was converted to C before or as part of the process of getting brought into brl-cad circa 87. gotta be a contendor for oldest written code in brl-cad still in use.  move hartwig up to code contributions
d600 2
a601 2
	* AUTHORS:
	ran across george toth's name on src/librt/memalloc.c which cvs shows dating back to at least 1988.  that makes him almost certainly a BRL contributor, though uncertain where he falls in the timeline in relation to the others and whether or not he was a core developer (indications point towards isolated contributions)
d603 1
a603 2
	* src/librt/db_io.c:
	lseek() function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of file so make sure we check that the offset provided to db_read is not larger than the size of the file
d605 2
a606 2
	* src/librt/dir.c:
	no sense in bombing if we're asked to free an internal with an unset meth function pointer.  if it's set, make sure it's valid, then call the callback.
d608 1
a608 1
	* src/librt/db_tree.c: already did an RT_INIT_DB_INTERNAL
d610 1
a610 2
	* src/mged/bodyio.c:
	remove dead #if 0'd code -- regardless, importing an object from disk shouldn't imply creating the object if it doesn't exist..
d612 1
a612 2
	* BUGS:
	concave arbs give correct wireframe but do not raytrace correctly -- this is documented as unsupported, but mged shouldn't allow it if it's not going to work.  regardless the wireframe shouldn't imply that it should work or it should be made to work

	* TODO:
	fixed perf.sh pathing issue, sucked file into run.sh as a function -- can consider an option later that allows only computation of perf stats instead of running the benchmark there later
d679 1
a679 1
	* bench/Makefile.am: perf.sh is gone, absorbed into 'benchmark'
d681 2
a682 2
	* bench/Attic/perf.sh, bench/run.sh:
	the perf.sh script is completely absorbed into run.sh as the function perf() allowing utilization of run.sh's existing search techniques for locating resources.  This fixes a problem/bug where perf.sh was incorrectly searching the right directory for reference logs.  by bringing the functionality internal, run.sh now gets to control righting to summary and there is no need to blindly tail the summary file for results.

	* regress/gqa.sh, src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	Changed handling of -g option.  If user specifies only 1 value, it is now the
	LIMIT on how small to let the gridspacing get, not the initial spacing.
d941 1
a941 8
	* regress/gqa.sh, src/gtools/g_qa.1, src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	Updated termination check so that "vol/weight" tests cannot cause early
	termination when "error checks" are being done.  The -n required_hits flag
	now only applies to vol/weight calculations.  This fixes a behavioral bug
	where analysis could run past the "lower" limit on the grid spacing.
	Since interface checking is not implemented, it was removed it from the manpage.
	Updated manpage with new syntax for -g option.  This is not implemented, but it
	snuck in.  I'll commit the changes to g_qa.c RSN.

	add support for --enable-everything and --disable everything options to simplify configuration when making distributions.  this requires consolidating all the 'checking' print messages for whether args were select together after checking for the everything setting.  also, add the args to BC_RETRY_CONFIGURE so that they are preserved on reinvocation.

	* NEWS:
	clamped integer value printing of primitives in mged (addresses sf 'bug'/request 1359253).  this is a cosmetic change that identifies primitive values being displayed that are within hardware floating point tolerance of an integer and clamps the value to the integer instead of printing the floating point fuzz that got injected (most likely due to units or a double->float->double conversion).  this could be extended to all load/store operations to correct floating point conversion errors, but there's probably more to be gained by replacing floats with fastf_t's instead.

2005-11-11  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	mged now adds our bin dir to the user search path so that subcommands like rt and company work as expected without path problems

	* src/lgt/strtok.c: strtok.c was moved to libsysv
d11 1
a11 23
	* src/mged/ged.c:
	append the brl-cad bin directory to the end of the user's PATH during run-time to allow binaries to be automatically located without the user needing to append our location to their environment.  this will let the user invoke any brl-cad binary on the mged command-line even through an exec.

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am: add strtok.c

	* src/libsysv/strtok.c:
	initial strtok.c file pulled/moved from src/lgt, with proper libsysv inclusion testing and some cleanup.

	* configure.ac: check for strtok

	* src/mged/attach.c:
	hide a malformed Tk erorr that ends up missing a newline between statements.  since this is inherintly a Tk application, just remove that part of the interpreter result (loosing those few bytes of memory, but only once)

	* src/fb/fbstretch.c, src/fb/gif-fb.c:
	get rid of the NDEBUG hacking, configure provides for it now.  clean up the include/header ws

	* autogen.sh, bench/run.sh, sh/vers.sh:
	more consistency between the tail/head checking for the functionality of -n.  check for head and tail separately

	* src/lgt/Makefile.am, src/lgt/char.c, src/lgt/do_options.c, src/lgt/extern.h, src/lgt/hmenu.c, src/lgt/ir.c, src/lgt/lgt.c, src/lgt/lgt_db.c, src/lgt/mat_db.c, src/lgt/octree.c, src/lgt/prnt.c, src/lgt/reflect.c, src/lgt/sgi_dep.c, src/lgt/texture.c, src/lgt/trie.c:
	convert STATIC to static and obliterate the NDEBUG hacks now that it's consistent provided throughout the package via configure

2005-11-10  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>
d14 1
a14 1
	no longer install tclsh/wish, use btclsh/bwish.  this simplifies our scripting consistency and gives better knowledge over whose tools are being invoked, aside from also being able to customize the command processing, providing brl-cad tcl commands, and auto-loading our required packages.  this was done in 7.4.0
d16 2
a17 2
	* doc/README.BSD:
	comment on the 'libtool: install: warning: ... .la ... has not been installed in' warnings being spewed by libtool due to some libtool bug that fails to install the .la files.  this bug is not bsd specific, but considerably more frequently observed on bsd since ports has had a never version of libtool for some time now.  seems to be a bug in the newest versions and may be related to not using LT_INIT or using the slightly older libtool.m4 with the newest.  regardless, provide a work around for libtool's lameness.
d19 2
a20 2
	* Makefile.am:
	simplify the summary printing at the end, where a separation line comprised of asterisks is output with a length based on the dynamic length of the 'brl-cad is installed here' line.  the motivation for the change is due to the peculiar difference in the behavior of bsd make vs gnu make.  performing a mathematical expr that evaluates to zero (e.g. expr 3 - 3) causes expr to return a non-zero return value causing bsdmake to think something failed, even though we are in the middle of a special shell rule.  this 'failure' in turn halts a make install, although we are 'done' by this point anyways.  still, the error is annoying and using tr to generate the asterisks line is hopefully sufficiently portable, and it avoids the expr/bsdmakism regardless. may the bsd builds rejoice in unity.

	* configure.ac:
	use -Wnewline-eof instead of -fconstant-cfstrings as the 'benign' search_paths_first flag to be less confusing and perhaps even slightly useful -- the flag warns about files missing the trailing newline
d28 2
a29 2
	* configure.ac:
	re-add a benign flag along with the -search_paths_first option so that it's not accidentally picked up by other linkers as a -s and -e linker path resulting in warnings regarding an 'arch_paths_first' symbol entry point. used -fconstant-cfstrings (which we have none of).

d34 2
a35 2
	* src/mged/points/process.c, src/mged/points/process.h:
	rename the create functions to have a create_ prefix (e.g. create_plate), add condense_points and delete_points for removing null points from a set and deleting detected 5-point replicates in the input (implying a need to delete the previous point).

	* src/libbn/bn_tcl.c:
	Exposed two additional routines in the Tcl interface:
		bn_isect_line2_line2
		bn_isect_line3_line3
	This allows us to process data from the Arcsecond Vulcan(tm) in Tcl scripts
	instead of C code.

a43 3
	* src/gtools/g_qa.1, src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	The -g command line option can now have its arguments separated by either
	a comma or a hyphen now, based upon user request.
d45 2
a46 5
	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	The MGED mvall command was not catching when the user renames a sketch that
	is used by an extrude primitive.  The change mimics the treatment for
	combination records.  If the primitive being renamed is a sketch, we search
	to see if any "extrude" uses the sketch and updates the name in the "extrude".

	give the tests something to compile, a simple int should do.

	* autogen.sh:
	bogus autom4te.cache protection.  handle corrupted/invalid cache dirs that will cause aclocal to fail.  handle out-of-date cache dirs that autoconf 'should' recognize but obviously doesn't for at least most current versions of autoconf as well resulting in an unnecessary failure.  cache files shouldn't halt tools, stupid lame gnu build system tools.

	* m4/compiler.m4:
	make the compiler, linker, and preprocessor checks look for 'nrecognize' in the test output in case the return value happens to be zero so that options are properly enabled/disabled.

	Added rudimentary text handling. Uses vector font in libbn (vectfont.c) and
	nmg_vlist_to_eu() to create wire edges to represent the text.

	* src/librt/nmg_misc.c:
	Added a new method: nmg_vlist_to_eu( struct bu_list *vlist, struct shell *s )
	creates wire edges in the specified shell. The edges correspond to line segments in the
	list of "bn_vlist" structures passed in. Used in "dxf-g" to handle tet strings.

	* src/libbn/vectfont.c:
	Added new symbols: plus/minus, degree, and centerline.
	Corrected tp_setup() method (it was over-writing the symbols)

2005-10-02  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	don't buy into the philosophy of requiring a minimum version so strictly.  add extra failure support for configure.ac files that are actually using autoconf macros newer than the stated minimum requirement on the half-presumption that they are perhaps not strictly necessary for the build.  warn verbosely about any edits iff it helps autoconf succeed.  this helps everything 'just work' even for the maintainers without requiring tools to be updated for potentially insignificant _yet_still_ useful macros. the gnu autotools folks really suck for making forward/backwards cross-platform version support such a pain (both bugs and by trying to force devs onto a single version across all supported platforms).  issues like this make scons more appealing every day, impractical idiots.

	make note of the fact that ac_gnu_source requires autoconf 2.54+, and ac_header_stdbool requires 2.55+

d309 1
a309 2
	* src/libbu/parallel.c:
	Daniel Eischen on the FreeBSD project suggested using SIGINFO instead of calling the the private _thread_dump_info() function.  _thread_dump_info is/was provided by the bsd c_r library which is not used in certain 5.* versions of bsd (e.g. 5.4 on amd64) when using the -pthread option.  since _thread_dump_info is called when a SIGINFO is raised, it should be equivalent.  probably drops support for older bsd systems that predate sysinfo, but they'll probably require more work regardless

	this release is being made so that muves-s2 works, so that ajem integration is simplified (ajem folks won't need to patch anything, muves-s2 team doesn't need to explain anything).
d1488 1
a1488 2
	* NEWS:
	murray and morrison fixed 'embedded mged' tclscript files so that muves-s2 integrates correctly and simplifies ajem integration later.

	* configure.ac:
	Needed an extern of strsep for Irix where we're using our own strsep
	(hidden in libsysv)

2005-09-07  twingy  <twingy@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/scripts/adrt.py:

	* sh/header.sh: ignore manpage .SH COPYRIGHT lines

2005-09-06  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/header.sh:
	add support for manual pages.  BRL-CAD's gfdl documentation is actually dual-licensed so customize the comment block to include that detail.  less and other pagers that recognize and auto-format manpages don't work if comment is first, so make the comment block come after the .TH

2005-09-06  twingy  <twingy@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/isst/master/master.c, src/adrt/libtie/tie.c:
	investigating tie->free()

	* src/adrt/isst/master/isst_python.c:
	dump is now save.  added a load command.  both have verbose output.

	total tri num at byte position 4.

	* src/adrt/doc/binary_spec.txt: updated binary spec.

	* src/adrt/isst/master/Makefile.am, src/adrt/isst/observer/Makefile.am, src/adrt/libcommon/Makefile.am, src/adrt/libtie/define.h, src/adrt/libtie/kdtree.c, src/adrt/libtie/struct.h, src/adrt/libtie/tie.c, src/adrt/rise/master/Makefile.am, src/adrt/bench/Makefile.am:
	Aggressive prep is about 3.3x faster now.  Fixed a few Makefile.am's.

2005-09-05  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libsysv/strsep.c: need stdlib.h for NULL

	* .cvsignore: ignore ltmain.sh and so_locations

	* src/gtools/.cvsignore: ignore g_qa too

2005-09-04  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	support systems that provide a prefix and datadir (e.g. /usr and /usr/share respectively)

	* configure.ac:
	the default is still to build tk even if detected, so no sense in forcing the build on regardless of the configure argument.  it's close to working now if it's not already.

	* NEWS:
	configuration build fixes for Tk/Iwidgets (sf patch 1281175) provided by Michal Slonina

	* configure.ac:
	and Slonina conveniently also notices that the Tk test is now using the tcl interpreter, and thus needs the tcl header (sf patch 1281175)

	* configure.ac:
	Slonina (spell it right this time) provides a fix for the iwidgets test. a null result means failure (sf patch 1281175)

	* configure.ac:
	slolina points out a bug in the iwidgets test, the package name is capitalized (sf patch 1281175)

2005-08-31  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	kd-tree caching is now tuned to the point where full start-up time takes less than
	1/4 the time as it did with the fast mid-split algorithm.  This number should approach
	1/8 as the various parts of the packing/unpacking and caching algorithms are tuned
	even further.

2005-08-29  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS: overlay command in mged fixed

	Integrated kd-tree caching.
	It's generated with adrt_bench by supplying the -c argument.
	kdtree_cache_file,kdtree.cache goes into project.env file to make it work.

2005-08-28  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/g-obj.1, src/conv/g-obj.c, src/conv/g-wave.1, src/conv/g-wave.c, src/conv/Makefile.am:
	renamed g-wave to g-obj to reflect the conventional dominance of .obj's referring to the wavefront format and our converters using conventioned extensions.

2005-08-27  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	kdtree code was put into its own separate file since it's going to consume
	more than half the actual engine code.

2005-08-27  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	use AC_MSG_RESULT for the starting message and summary results so that they are inserted into config.log, and so they will obey the --verbose and --quiet flags too.

	* configure.ac: call them dials and buttons

	* configure.ac: knobs work

	* NEWS: NEWS items are formatted to column 70

	* TODO: ws

	* BUGS:

	mged will actually run without being installed now with the new relocation support and BRLCAD_DATA variable overrides

	* TODO: add database support for constraints, expressions, parametric
	  values, construction history, and timestamping

	* NEWS: performance enhancements to ADRT

	* TODO:
	multiple threading models not that important in the big picture, it works and works well enough given mips seems to be on it's way out off of sgi's high end line

	* TODO: tim has got aquatk working

	* NEWS: mged relocation support

	* TODO:
	libbu new has whereis-style support for locating it's resources at run-time

	add a configure test for SGI knobs support, and define the IR_KNOBS and IR_BUTTONS if/when they are available.

2005-08-27  twingy  <twingy@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/libtie/tie.c, src/adrt/libtie/define.h:
	Adding finishing touches to algorithm.  Will be adding some controls to
	tie_init to allow developer to control both agressiveness of kd-tree building
	algorithm and memory consumption as a function of # of triangles.

2005-08-26  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libfb/Makefile.am:
	damn two character omission that ends up disabling the X and ogl interfaces.. they're CFLAGS dammit

	* src/adrt/libtie/define.h, src/adrt/libtie/tie.c:
	working on final changes

	* src/adrt/libtie/tie.c: kd-tree code clean-up.

	* src/adrt/libtie/define.h, src/adrt/libtie/tie.c:
	New kd-tree building algorithm (yet to be named) is now suitable for general purpose
	use as an improvement (avg 25% - 100% faster) over the old algorithm and uses about
	half the memory consumption as before.  One more criteria is yet to be added, more
	improvements to come.  Algorithm is 10x slower than mid-split so kd-tree caching
	is on the way.

2005-08-25  twingy  <twingy@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/isst/master/master.c, src/adrt/libtie/tie.c:
	experimental kd-tree code finds empty space more agressively.
	master is printing fps for now.

2005-08-25  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* regress/shaders.sh:
	fixed so that mged can run and find prj_add when mged hasn't been installed yet

	* NEWS: Logging changes for g_qa and regression test system

	* regress/solids.sh, regress/weight.sh: Miscelaneous bug fixes.

	Getting the nightly tests to work.
	Making the scripts report an exit code when things go wrong.

2005-08-25  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/brlregex.h: remove the common.h unnecessity

2005-08-25  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* regress/lights.sh:
	No longer pass 2 arguments to script.  Had to change $2 to $1

	corrected a bad null initialized assumption

2005-08-25  twingy  <twingy@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/libtie/define.h, src/adrt/libtie/tie.c:
	experimenting with kd-tree's

2005-08-25  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/bu.h: need bu_argv0 to be exported, mged uses it

2005-08-24  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS: fixed mged startup resource bug

	* src/mged/cmd.c:
	it is important to run Tcl_FindExecutable BEFORE running the init funcs so that they can do a better job and finding their scripts (thx Enrique Perez-Terron).  use the argv[0] we stashed during startup into libbu.

	* include/rle_config.h: define USE_PROTOTYPES

2005-08-24  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am:
	Needed to make sure that brlcad_config.h didn't get stuffed into the dist

2005-08-24  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/RtServerImpl.h, src/librtserver/rtserver.c, src/librtserver/rtserverTest.c:

	* src/conv/Makefile.am: typo, remove the stray asc2g

	* src/conv/asc2g.c, src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	separate sections for strsep and strtok are no longer necessary since strsep is provided via libsysv now

	* src/conv/Makefile.am: asc2g potentially needs SYSV for strsep

	* src/gtools/Makefile.am: g_qa potentially needs SYSV for strsep

	* src/libbu/linebuf.c:
	keep port_setlinebuf around just a little bit longer even though it's been deprecated for some time.  the reason is because our own examples and several converters still used port_ instead of bu_ even including the example converter..

	* include/bu.h:
	port_setlinebuf is deprecated, so remove it from here and move it to src/libbu/linebuf.c where we bu_log a deprecation warning message

	* src/conv/g-euclid.c, src/conv/g-euclid1.c, src/conv/g-nmg.c, src/conv/g-tankill.c, src/conv/g-vrml.c, src/conv/g-x3d.c, src/conv/g-xxx.c, src/conv/nmg-sgp.c, src/iges/g-iges.c:
	replace the deprecated port_setlinebuf() with bu_setlinebuf()

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am, src/libsysv/linebuf.c:
	removed the antiquated linebuf.c that contained the long since deprecated port_setlinebuf() in favor of the libbu bu_setlinebuf()

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am:
	enable the compilation of getopt, memset, strchr, strsep again

	* src/libsysv/getopt.c, src/libsysv/memset.c, src/libsysv/strchr.c:
	don't compile these functions being provided for convenience if the system already has them

	* src/libsysv/strsep.c:
	add the bsd strsep() function for systems like irix that still don't have it

2005-08-23  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac, src/adrt/bench/Makefile.am, src/adrt/isst/master/Makefile.am:

2005-08-23  twingy  <twingy@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/adrt/libutil/Makefile.am: fixed dist

	* src/adrt/libtie/define.h, src/adrt/libtie/tie.c:
	removed min surface area, bad heuristics to use

2005-08-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	apply Enrique Perez-Terron's suggestions/fixes regarding assumption that sed exists when verbose is enabled, now should properly test sed

2005-08-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	Put it all together: add the primary checks for building against X11, OpenGL, SDL, and Python.  Still vast room for improvement, but a step towards fully-uncoupled builds -- especially for the folks without X11 and OpenGL.  Summary no longer reports auto, it reports what it decided.

	* TODO:
	ogl is somewhat configurable now.  prez thinks there are no hidden messages.

	* configure.ac:
	begin merging in the rest of the new checks -- check for a python interpreter and sdl-config.  move the display manager defines lower, soon to be killed.  move the CFLAGS override and LD sanity check to the beginning environment section.

	* configure.ac:
	make debug 'auto' by default instead of forced on to avoid aborting unnecessarily. move the pg test before the g test

	* configure.ac:
	if the user specifically requests profile or debug builds (i.e. not the 'auto' default), don't just warn -- abort.

	* configure.ac:
	debug builds cannot omit the frame pointer, so don't add -fomit-frame-pointer when using --enable-optimized and --enable-debug together

2005-08-21  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librtserver/Makefile.am:
	java conditional is now WITH_JAVA for consistency

	use the new configureation conditionals for opengl, x11, and adrt

	* configure.ac:
	add initial configuration options --with-opengl --with-sdl --with-python --with-x11 adding them to the output and minimal checks for the user's selection (though no meat yet)

	* misc/Makefile.defs:
	add a 'noprod' or 'prodclean' make target to remove all the built binaries/libraries

	* TODO:
	add x11 and ogl config to this iteration, as well as the knobs yet again

	* src/util/bw-png.c, src/util/double-asc.c, src/util/imgdims.c, src/util/pix-png.c, src/util/pix-ppm.c, src/util/pixbgstrip.c, src/util/pixborder.c, src/util/pixcount.c, src/util/pixcut.c, src/util/pixhalve.c, src/util/pixmorph.c, src/util/pixpaste.c, src/util/texturescale.c, src/util/bw-a.c:

	* configure.ac, include/config_win.h:
	update version to 7.6.4, release preparations under way
d4 1
a4 43
	begin release preparations for 7.6.4.  add verbose release notes on the new geometry creation interface to mged that reads in point data sets.

	* src/adrt/misc/Makefile.am: another trailing slash missing

	* src/adrt/Makefile.am:
	remove the inadvertent m-x 4 f .. extraneous 4 removed

	* src/adrt/Makefile.am:
	missing the damn trailing slash on an extra_dist entry

	* src/libbu/parallel.c:
	move the bu_param for irix 64 outside the block so it gets defined, also fix a typo in a ppc section where sysctl return value wasn't getting checked correctly

2005-11-11  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	mged now adds our bin dir to the user search path so that subcommands like rt and company work as expected without path problems

	* src/lgt/strtok.c: strtok.c was moved to libsysv

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	append the brl-cad bin directory to the end of the user's PATH during run-time to allow binaries to be automatically located without the user needing to append our location to their environment.  this will let the user invoke any brl-cad binary on the mged command-line even through an exec.

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am: add strtok.c

	* src/libsysv/strtok.c:
	initial strtok.c file pulled/moved from src/lgt, with proper libsysv inclusion testing and some cleanup.

	* configure.ac: check for strtok

	* src/mged/attach.c:
	hide a malformed Tk erorr that ends up missing a newline between statements.  since this is inherintly a Tk application, just remove that part of the interpreter result (loosing those few bytes of memory, but only once)

	* src/fb/fbstretch.c, src/fb/gif-fb.c:
	get rid of the NDEBUG hacking, configure provides for it now.  clean up the include/header ws

	* autogen.sh, bench/run.sh, sh/vers.sh:
	more consistency between the tail/head checking for the functionality of -n.  check for head and tail separately

	* src/lgt/Makefile.am, src/lgt/char.c, src/lgt/do_options.c, src/lgt/extern.h, src/lgt/hmenu.c, src/lgt/ir.c, src/lgt/lgt.c, src/lgt/lgt_db.c, src/lgt/mat_db.c, src/lgt/octree.c, src/lgt/prnt.c, src/lgt/reflect.c, src/lgt/sgi_dep.c, src/lgt/texture.c, src/lgt/trie.c:
	convert STATIC to static and obliterate the NDEBUG hacks now that it's consistent provided throughout the package via configure

	no longer install tclsh/wish, use btclsh/bwish.  this simplifies our scripting consistency and gives better knowledge over whose tools are being invoked, aside from also being able to customize the command processing, providing brl-cad tcl commands, and auto-loading our required packages.  this was done in 7.4.0
d9 1
a9 47
	* doc/README.BSD:
	comment on the 'libtool: install: warning: ... .la ... has not been installed in' warnings being spewed by libtool due to some libtool bug that fails to install the .la files.  this bug is not bsd specific, but considerably more frequently observed on bsd since ports has had a never version of libtool for some time now.  seems to be a bug in the newest versions and may be related to not using LT_INIT or using the slightly older libtool.m4 with the newest.  regardless, provide a work around for libtool's lameness.

	* Makefile.am:
	simplify the summary printing at the end, where a separation line comprised of asterisks is output with a length based on the dynamic length of the 'brl-cad is installed here' line.  the motivation for the change is due to the peculiar difference in the behavior of bsd make vs gnu make.  performing a mathematical expr that evaluates to zero (e.g. expr 3 - 3) causes expr to return a non-zero return value causing bsdmake to think something failed, even though we are in the middle of a special shell rule.  this 'failure' in turn halts a make install, although we are 'done' by this point anyways.  still, the error is annoying and using tr to generate the asterisks line is hopefully sufficiently portable, and it avoids the expr/bsdmakism regardless. may the bsd builds rejoice in unity.

2005-11-09  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	use -Wnewline-eof instead of -fconstant-cfstrings as the 'benign' search_paths_first flag to be less confusing and perhaps even slightly useful -- the flag warns about files missing the trailing newline

	* configure.ac:
	re-add a benign flag along with the -search_paths_first option so that it's not accidentally picked up by other linkers as a -s and -e linker path resulting in warnings regarding an 'arch_paths_first' symbol entry point. used -fconstant-cfstrings (which we have none of).

2005-11-08  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/points/process.c, src/mged/points/process.h:
	rename the create functions to have a create_ prefix (e.g. create_plate), add condense_points and delete_points for removing null points from a set and deleting detected 5-point replicates in the input (implying a need to delete the previous point).

2005-11-08  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbn/bn_tcl.c:
	Exposed two additional routines in the Tcl interface:
		bn_isect_line2_line2
		bn_isect_line3_line3
	This allows us to process data from the Arcsecond Vulcan(tm) in Tcl scripts
	instead of C code.

	* src/gtools/g_qa.1, src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	The -g command line option can now have its arguments separated by either
	a comma or a hyphen now, based upon user request.

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	The MGED mvall command was not catching when the user renames a sketch that
	is used by an extrude primitive.  The change mimics the treatment for
	combination records.  If the primitive being renamed is a sketch, we search
	to see if any "extrude" uses the sketch and updates the name in the "extrude".

2005-11-08  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* m4/compiler.m4:
	give the tests something to compile, a simple int should do.

	* autogen.sh:
	bogus autom4te.cache protection.  handle corrupted/invalid cache dirs that will cause aclocal to fail.  handle out-of-date cache dirs that autoconf 'should' recognize but obviously doesn't for at least most current versions of autoconf as well resulting in an unnecessary failure.  cache files shouldn't halt tools, stupid lame gnu build system tools.

	* src/librt/dg_obj.c:
	simplify the ifdef logic and always use argv for rtcheck

	* src/librt/dg_obj.c:
	argv[0], not 'rt' -- used by all the rt-style binaries

2005-11-06  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	instead of a helpful display message, try just using a local port -- if that fails, leave it up to X11's "useful" error message

	* NEWS: mged utilizes a local display if unspecified/unset

	* src/mged/ged.c:
	if tk fails to load, try a simple local port initialization.  replace the exit calls with mged_finish calls like we're supposed to.  if the database doesn't exist, notify the parent we're done before exiting so parent exits cleanly.

	* NEWS, src/tclscripts/mged/bindings.tcl:
	set default mged Escape key binding to reject

	* NEWS: fixed 'benchmark' tool resource searching

	* TODO:
	the benchmark suite searching was rewritten, fixed, and improved.  ready to release

	* src/other/URToolkit/tools/clock/rleClock.c:

	* BUGS: mged's solid illuminate doesn't work when Lighting is turned on

2005-11-04  lbutler  <lbutler@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS, doc/html/manuals/mged/mged_cmd_index.html, src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	make_bb didn't have the ubiquitous -u option that all the other raytracing
	apps have.  Now it does.  This allows users to make bounding boxes of
	geometry that includes/is air.

2005-11-04  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/README.Linux:
	comment on the inability to run binaries from an uninstalled ppc64 debian system

	* src/other/URToolkit/cnv/rletoabA62/rletoabA62.c:
	quell warning about main not returning an int

	* src/lgt/execshell.c:
	the win32 section for _sys_errlist isn't needed as the config_win.h header takes care of it

	* doc/README.Solaris:
	comment on the solaris/gcc -mimpure-text option to get a static system library to link against a shared library being built

	* include/rle_config.h:
	include common.h so that HAVE_ symbols may be used to work around compilation support issues.  e.g. sys_errlist on solaris

	* src/burst/prnt.c, src/other/URToolkit/tools/into.c:
	sys_errlist is defined as _sys_errlist in include/config_win.h so no need for the duplicated WIN32 sections

	* include/config_win.h: sys_nerr is _sys_nerr under windows too

	* src/libpkg/pkg.c: strerror section is in the wrong section

2005-11-04  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Add code to guard against an old .archerrc that uses the "Crystal (Large)" theme. Add code to toggle whether to use the draw command -n option (normals).

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Wizard.tcl:
	Add the following methods: buildGridZonesXML, vectorAdd and vectorScale

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c:
	The default behavior of the "find" command has been changed. It now ignores hidden objects. A -a option has been added to give the original behavior (find all, even hidden).

2005-11-04  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/burst/Hm.h, src/burst/Sc.c, src/burst/Sc.h, src/burst/burst.c, src/burst/burst.h, src/burst/extern.h, src/burst/fb.c, src/burst/glob.c, src/burst/grid.c, src/burst/idents.c, src/burst/prnt.c, src/burst/trie.c, src/burst/ui.c, src/burst/Hm.c:
	burst the non-ansi-yet-willing-to-pretend-we-are-c99 bubble that the burst code likes to use.  that is, use static instead of STATIC and don't clobber the bool/true/false reserved words of the c++ compilers.  clean up the headers to support this.

	* bench/run.sh:
	it's not _really_ necessary that there be no debug symbols, just make a note of it in the output.  inform about the benchmark.tr document regardless.

	* bench/run.sh:
	add support to look for specific types of files, executables, dirs, scripts as well as cleaning up detection and output of whether this is a 'valid' benchmark run.  if it does seem to be valid, inform about the documentation and encourage submission of results.

	* bench/run.sh:
	refactor the resource searching into a look_for function so that it's clear exactly what directories are being searched for which resources.  remove the compiling and automatic conversion of encountered ascii files for now too.  resources are searched for presuming first that we're a binary install and failing that, we're being run from a source distribution after a make or make benchmark.  identify the major sections with comment labels, and rename the benchmark function to bench in order to not be confused with the tool of the same name.  this fixes a bug in the run-time identification of resources in the share/brlcad/VERSION directory.

	* src/burst/Hm.c, src/burst/burst.c, src/burst/grid.c, src/burst/idents.c, src/burst/paint.c, src/burst/prnt.c, src/burst/trie.c, src/burst/ui.c:
	DEBUG/NDEBUG cleanup, pull the value from and include common.h before system headers

	* src/rt/main.c:
	output a warning iff compile-time debugging is enabled so the benchmark tests can look for it

	* configure.ac:
	define compile-time debug/non-debug symbols DEBUG and NDEBUG so they are consistently available across the package (and so assert() can pick up NDEBUG correctly).  DEBUG is used by rt to make a note in the log that this is a debug build

2005-11-03  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/mged/points/Makefile.am:
	cylic dependency apparently -- try the .y

	* src/mged/points/Makefile.am:
	the headers are missing, help make distcheck work

	* configure.ac:
	readd the searching of top_srcdir/include as it is required in order to support distcheck and building in non-srcdir builds.  since it causes trouble for the system facility/header checks (e.g. tcl.h -- which probably shouldn't be in 'our' main header dir anyways), set the cppflag after the system checks are done.

	* src/util/pl-sgi.c, src/util/sgi-pix.c:
	missing bu.h header for bu_getopt()

	* src/mged/points/process.c: accomodate irix's lack of c99 compliance

	* NEWS, TODO: improved AIX compiler support

2005-11-02  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/util/Makefile.am:
	strchr.c went to libsysv so remove it from the dist list

2005-11-01  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac, src/mged/points/process.c:
	check for stdint.h and inttypes.h (irix doesn't have stdint.h)

	* src/mged/points/Makefile.am:
	the header file depends on a libtool object

	* NEWS:
	head/tail -n usage posix compliance, accepting a modified version of Stefan Fiedler's tail/head patch for -n # instead of -# as the line option.  this conforms to _POSIX2_VERSION 200112 for head/tail.

	* sh/vers.sh:
	accept a modified version of Stefan Fiedler's tail/head patch for -n # instead of -# as the line option.  this conforms to _POSIX2_VERSION 200112 and tools compiled against said posix version that allow run-time complaince forcing.

	* sh/header.sh: -n comes before

	* sh/make_dmg.sh:
	presume posix behavior in the tools, accepting a modified version of stefan fiedler's e-mailed patch.  solaris is known to have issues but that should not be relevant to this script at all

	* doc/html/manuals/Anim_Tutorial/chapt2.html, doc/html/manuals/mged/animmate/object_tut.html, doc/html/manuals/mged/animmate/rt_tut.html, sh/header.sh:
	presume posix behavior in the tools, accepting a modified version of stefan fiedler's e-mailed patch.  solaris is known to have issues but that should be extremely minor

	* bench/run.sh:
	accept a modified version of Stefan Fiedler's tail/head patch for -n # instead of -# as the line option.  this conforms to _POSIX2_VERSION 200112 and tools compiled against said posix version too.

2005-10-31  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BUGS:
	raytrace of -s64 and remote -F/dev/Xl crashes inside an empty memcpy

	* src/liboptical/shade.c:
	if the intersection normal that's returned is knowingly reversed, flip it (while still complaining).  this usually indicates a bug in the underlying primitive or a problem with the geometry itself, but rendering nothing/black is pretty worthless.  also, limit the number of shade_input messages about flipped normals to just 100 so as not to spew unnecessarily to the console and slowing down the raytrace.

	* src/librt/g_nurb.c: header cleanup

	* src/tclscripts/mged/points.tcl:
	add support for creating spheres from point sets

	* src/mged/points/Makefile.am:
	encourage main and process to compile after points_parse.h is generated.  put main after anyways just to be safe

	* src/mged/rtif.c: remove unused chan1 var

	* include/dm-Null.h:
	missing end comment.  fortunately it's an empty header, but say so to be open about it

	* src/fbed/prnt.c:
	remove the unnecessary prnt_Event declaration, can conflict anyways

	* src/fbed/execshell.c, src/fbed/fbed.c, src/fbed/pos_pad.c:
	quell compiler warnings by including the requisite headers

	* src/fbed/extern.h:
	declare the Va_Decl functions the same when Va_Decl decides how to prototype them, otherwise there can be a mismatch (and there was on aix).  add prnt_Debug while we're at it since one of the routines uses it as an extern func.

	* src/fbed/loadfont.c: set return type to int, quell warning

	* src/burst/Hm.c, src/burst/Sc.h, src/burst/Tc.h, src/burst/error.c, src/burst/prnt.c:
	remove the deprecated Tc terminal capabilities routines/defines  that were converted to use libtermio -- just use libtermio directly now making the Tc routines officially obsoleted

	* src/burst/Makefile.am:
	remove the obsolete Tc.h and Tc.c interface files

	* src/burst/Tc.c:
	removed the empty compilation unit that's been deprecated/replaced for years

	* src/burst/Mm.h: header cleanup, get rid of the non-ansi cruft

	prototype and declaration consistency with the non-ansi sections

	* include/raytrace.h, src/librt/nmg_misc.c, src/librt/nmg_rt_segs.c, src/librt/nmg_visit.c:

	* NEWS: point parsing/import interface to mged

	* NEWS: added los and material name support to librtserver

	* NEWS: john fixed bug in dxf-g and nmg export

2005-10-30  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_nmg.c:
	rt_nmg_export5() broke out of loop too early. Changed "break" into an if block

	* src/conv/iges/trimsurf.c:
	Convtrimsurfs() was calling nmg_km() when it shouldn't

2005-10-29  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS: fixed itcl configuration issue

	* configure.ac:
	itcl doesn't need to include the include directory, in fact it causes problems since it can pick up our itcl.h which picks up our tcl.h which requires common.h which requires HAVE_CONFIG_H to be defined which causes problems. (thanks Stefan Fiedler)  in face, don't add include to our overall cppflags either since autoheader is supposed to take care of this in the makefiles

	* src/mged/points/Makefile.am:
	designate the BUILT_SOURCES so that they are generated first

	* src/mged/points/main.c, src/mged/points/process.h:
	header file is named points_parse.h now

	* src/mged/points/.cvsignore: ignore the generated sources

	* src/tclscripts/mged/Makefile.am: include the points.tcl file

	* src/tclscripts/mged/points.tcl:
	initial points tclscript for generating geometry based on sets of points being processed in certain styles, written by lee -- works in conjunction with the src/mged/points library that parses the points from a given file

	* src/mged/points/Makefile.am:
	wrong fast objects list, no sense just making it static -- libtool will figure it out

	* src/mged/ged.h: there is no f_edit()

	* src/mged/chgview.c:
	comment cleanup, several functions have disappeared or been renamed

	* src/mged/cmd.c, src/mged/cmd.h:
	export the cmd_parse_points routine for parsing point files

	* src/mged/Makefile.am: traverse into the points subdir too

	* configure.ac: generate the makefile for src/mged/points

	* src/mged/points/Makefile.am:
	initial Makefile.am for building a utility library to be used by mged for reading point files

	* src/mged/points/count.c, src/mged/points/count.h:
	generic counting routines for reporting parse/scan statistics

	* src/mged/points/main.c, src/mged/points/points_parse.y, src/mged/points/points_scan.l, src/mged/points/process.c, src/mged/points/process.h:
	initial files for a points file parser that reads them all in and processes groups of them at a time based on recognized line labels.  data collected in a requisite order may then be automatically turned into geometry using a tclscript helper code.

	* src/other/libtk/Makefile.am:
	don't link libtk static, causes trouble in libtclcad on altix where non-PIC get included which causes an ld failure.

	* src/bwish/Makefile.am:
	try making the libs consistent between bwish and btclsh to get around symbol and run-time issues

	* src/libtclcad/Makefile.am:
	revert tk back in, the lib uses tk extensively so it needs to be on the list

	* src/conv/iges/g-iges.c:
	just reference current dir instead of up and down to iges dir

2005-10-29  dtremenak  <dtremenak@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/iges/g-iges.c, src/conv/jack/g-jack.c:
	librt is two levels away.  iges is one level away.

2005-10-29  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/jack/jack-g.c, src/conv/unigraphics/ug-g.c, src/conv/unigraphics/ug_misc.c, src/conv/iges/do_subfigs.c, src/conv/iges/g-iges.c, src/conv/iges/iges.c, src/conv/iges/main.c, src/conv/iges/trimsurf.c:
	fix relative include paths after the move to src/conv (thanks dtr)

2005-10-29  dtremenak  <dtremenak@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/other/jove/jove.h:
	jove.h conflicts with stdio.h if _GNU_SOURCE is defined.  make sure it's not.

2005-10-28  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	since autogen.sh is a succint step, presume that we simply want to end up with the same COPYING and INSTALL that we started with, so restore from backup if they change regardless of the current revision

2005-10-27  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/remrt/Makefile.am:
	1 per line consistency for easier diff'ing as they change

	* src/rt/Makefile.am:
	cleanup new bot_faces target using COMMON, and utilize COMMON in ALLSRCS

	* src/rttherm/Makefile.am:
	have to link static due to librttherm.a, the aix linker, and duplicate symbols in optical/multispectral

	* BUGS, NEWS: fixed the g_qa tolerance option bug

	* src/gtools/g_qa.1:
	delimit -g option with a comma, not a dash -- dash is indistinguishable from a negative sign

	* src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	delimit on comma like the docs state, not on dash -- looks like a negative

	* src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	squash a ton of compiler warnings, fix a bug related to printing "" as the invalid units on -g, still doesn't parse the units/values correctly though

	* src/libsysv/strchr.c, src/libsysv/strsep.c: header cleanup

	* src/util/Makefile.am, src/util/strdup.c:
	moved strdup.c to src/libsysv/.

	* src/libsysv/Makefile.am, src/libsysv/strdup.c:
	add strdup.c (moved from src/util)

	* src/util/strchr.c:

2005-10-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	add a check to see if automake chokes on libtool as well (since sans -f autoconf may complete successfully)

	* sh/any-png.sh, sh/cadbug.sh, sh/cakeinclude.sh, sh/copyright.sh, sh/cray.sh, sh/elapsed.sh, sh/footer.sh, sh/indent.sh, sh/ldAix.sh, sh/make_bz2.sh, sh/make_deb.sh, sh/make_dmg.sh, sh/make_pkg.sh, sh/make_rpm.sh, sh/make_tar.sh, sh/make_tgz.sh, sh/make_zip.sh, sh/pixinfo.sh, sh/pixread.sh, sh/pixwrite.sh, sh/sgisnap.sh, sh/show.sh, sh/vers.sh, sh/header.sh:
	ws

	* autogen.sh:
	search for libtoolize14, make sure that we can pinpoint the alternate libtoolize's location via which/dirname in order to print instructions correctly.  fix typo on glti

2005-10-21  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO:
	mged should add bin dir to search path so that subcommands like rt and company work as expected without path problems

	* BUGS: g2asc exports attr lines but will not grok them on asc2g

	* TODO:
	aix build fixes, configure option for no flag dorkage, and fixing benchmark path issue before next release

	* src/libwdb/dsp.c, src/libwdb/ebm.c, src/libwdb/submodel.c, src/libwdb/vol.c:
	machine.h includes stdio.h, common.h goes first too

	* include/machine.h: needed for FOPEN_MAX

	* include/machine.h:
	machine.h apparently requires stdio.h so migrate towards self-describing headers (even though machine.h is going away soon)

2005-10-21  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/g_bot.c: unused variable deleted

	* src/librt/db_io.c: variable s only if HAVE_UNIX_IO

	* src/libsysv/engine.c:
	MS VC 6.0 complained about a control path that does not return a value

	* src/libwdb/dsp.c, src/libwdb/ebm.c, src/libwdb/submodel.c, src/libwdb/vol.c:
	machine.h requires stdio.h

2005-10-21  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	get rid of the -fPIC hack, libtool really should take care of it (figure out the altix problem later if it's still around); get rid of -mdynamic-no-pic as it wasn't supposed to actually get added to a flag, it only encouraged the test to fail on non darwin systems before the tests were refactored to BC_ tests.

	* m4/compiler.m4:
	make the compiler, linker, and preprocessor checks look for 'nrecognize' in the test output in case the return value happens to be zero so that options are properly enabled/disabled.

2005-10-19  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/rt/main.c: initialize pointers to NULL

	* AUTHORS:
	added special thanks to Sander Pronk of TNO-PML for his work on v4 platform issues

	* src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	HUGE is not portably available, provide alternatives (fixes sf bug 1328013)

2005-10-19  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	Add the following methods: erotate, escale and etranslate

	* src/tclscripts/swidgets/scripts/tree.itk:
	Mods to prevent the selectcmd from being called recursively. Mods to limit the number of redraws from the "remove" method

2005-10-18  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/README.WIN32: oops, named it README.Windows instead

	* doc/README.AIX, doc/README.BSD, doc/README.Linux, doc/README.Solaris, doc/README.WIN32, doc/README.Windows, doc/Makefile.am:

	* src/librt/wdb_obj.c: Add erotate, escale and etranslate commands.

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Modify importFg4Sections to take a delta for translation purposes. Add the following methods: erotate, escale, etranslate, launchDisplayMenuBegin and launchDisplayMenuEnd.

2005-10-17  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* BUGS: mged's matrix selection does not modify the correct matrix

2005-10-14  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/nurb_c2.c:
	probable a typing error: it should be vve, not uve

2005-10-13  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librt/nmg_fuse.c: type consistency initialization

2005-10-13  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libbu/stat.c: machine.h requires stdio.h to be included first

	* src/librt/nmg_fuse.c:
	initialize pl in nmg_snurb_is_planar (look at pl[3]!)
	unused variable deleted

	* src/librt/bigE.c: unused variables deleted

	* include/machine.h: _SYS_OPEN is an anchestor of FOPEN_MAX too

2005-10-13  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/librtserver/rtserver.c:
	getItemTree() implementation now saves los, material name, and use count in the ItemTree leaf nodes.

2005-10-07  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	oh yeah, twingy disabled ADRT permanently, though I forget why.  re-enable it.

2005-10-07  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO: new section: oddities
	why is there a scale in bn_cmd_noise_slice?

	* src/libbn/bn_tcl.c: initialize scale structure

2005-10-07  johnranderson  <johnranderson@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/conv/dxf-g.c:
	Added rudimentary text handling. Uses vector font in libbn (vectfont.c) and
	nmg_vlist_to_eu() to create wire edges to represent the text.

	* src/librt/nmg_misc.c:
	Added a new method: nmg_vlist_to_eu( struct bu_list *vlist, struct shell *s )
	creates wire edges in the specified shell. The edges correspond to line segments in the
	list of "bn_vlist" structures passed in. Used in "dxf-g" to handle tet strings.

	* src/libbn/vectfont.c:
	Added new symbols: plus/minus, degree, and centerline.
	Corrected tp_setup() method (it was over-writing the symbols)

2005-10-06  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/archer/archer:
	Change the location where archer.ico is found. This affects only the windows version

2005-10-04  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO: support variable overrides for autogen.sh

	* TODO: configure outputs better

	* TODO: manpages have their legal headers added

	* TODO: M-x indent-region scripts

2005-10-02  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	don't buy into the philosophy of requiring a minimum version so strictly.  add extra failure support for configure.ac files that are actually using autoconf macros newer than the stated minimum requirement on the half-presumption that they are perhaps not strictly necessary for the build.  warn verbosely about any edits iff it helps autoconf succeed.  this helps everything 'just work' even for the maintainers without requiring tools to be updated for potentially insignificant _yet_still_ useful macros. the gnu autotools folks really suck for making forward/backwards cross-platform version support such a pain (both bugs and by trying to force devs onto a single version across all supported platforms).  issues like this make scons more appealing every day, impractical idiots.

2005-10-01  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	make note of the fact that ac_gnu_source requires autoconf 2.54+, and ac_header_stdbool requires 2.55+

	* autogen.sh: follow our own ws rules

	* autogen.sh:
	autoconf 2.52 on os x 10.2 does not support the -f option, so try to continue without it if autoconf fails

2005-09-29  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac, include/config_win.h: bump to 7.6.3 after tag/release

	* src/tclscripts/lib/TableView.tcl:
	Create various SystemXXX variables and set depending on platform

	* src/tclscripts/swidgets/scripts/tree.itk:
	Modified the tree widget to not use the canvas' selection mechanism

2005-09-29  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog: very simple change set for this emergency release

	* NEWS:
	this release is being made so that muves-s2 works, so that ajem integration is simplified (ajem folks won't need to patch anything, muves-s2 team doesn't need to explain anything).

	* NEWS:
	murray and morrison fixed 'embedded mged' tclscript files so that muves-s2 integrates correctly and simplifies ajem integration later.

	* NEWS: new section for 7.6.2

	* src/tclscripts/lib/TableView.tcl:
	get rid of the SystemBuuton and System Window symbols as they are windows-specific and cause breakage in one of the muves tools (this file is not used internally yet, it's used by archer)

	* src/tclscripts/lib/Display.tcl:
	add the missing rtarea/rtweight declarations

	* README, configure.ac, include/config_win.h:
	bump to 7.6.2 for an emergency patch release to coincide with a muves release

2005-09-28  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Add refreshTree, find, get and report methods

	* src/tclscripts/archer/cursor.tcl: Initial check-in

	* src/tclscripts/archer/cursor.tcl: New file.

	* src/archer/archer:
	Change archerDebug to Archer::debug; move SetNormalCursor and SetWaitCursor totclscripts/archer/cursor.tcl

2005-09-28  d_rossberg  <d_rossberg@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/libsysv/libsysv.dsp, src/libwdb/libwdb.dsp, src/libbu/libbu.dsp, src/librt/librt.dsp, src/libbn/libbn.dsp:
	deleting vers.c was counterproductive

2005-09-26  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* include/config_win.h: Change INSTALL_DIRECTORY

	* src/tclscripts/archer/LoadArcherLibs.tcl:
	Add code to set haveSdb; No longer need to load libpng and tkimgpng

	* src/tclscripts/archer/Archer.tcl:
	Add haveSdb to Archer namespace; move code that sets haveSdb to LoadArcherLibs

	* src/other/libpng/png.h:
	Exporting png_read_destroy and png_write_destroy (tkimg needs them)

	* include/png.h, include/pngconf.h: Updates for libpng 1.2.8

2005-09-23  erikgreenwald  <erikgreenwald@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: FreeBSD renames libtcl8.4 to libtcl84

2005-09-23  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README: includes a benchmark performance analysis suite

2005-09-22  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/archer/archer: Minor cleanup

2005-09-22  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	check for the signal.h header and raise(), used by libbu/parallel.c

	* src/libbu/parallel.c:
	Daniel Eischen on the FreeBSD project suggested using SIGINFO instead of calling the the private _thread_dump_info() function.  _thread_dump_info is/was provided by the bsd c_r library which is not used in certain 5.* versions of bsd (e.g. 5.4 on amd64) when using the -pthread option.  since _thread_dump_info is called when a SIGINFO is raised, it should be equivalent.  probably drops support for older bsd systems that predate sysinfo, but they'll probably require more work regardless

	* src/util/Makefile.am:
	reorganize the whole lot of sources/ldadd descriptors so that they are sorted.  add libbu as a dep for the bu_getopt mods

2005-09-22  bob1961  <bob1961@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/archer/archer: Change brlDataPath to brlcadDataPath

	profile the DM_X and DM_OGL flags here instead of automatically on in configure.  should be autodetecting better now

	* src/libdm/dm_obj.c:
	header cleanup, might as well use libfb's interface file for the extern declarations and be specific about the dependency

	rework tkwin into cmd.c and profide the DM_X and DM_OGL defines to the build.  probably fixes a bug or two of some sort on the display manager.  also migrate the tolerance vars together along with other ws and header cleanup

	* configure.ac:
	massive changes, conversion over to new macros for the compiler/linker tests.  identify each section of the configure file using the configure stage macro that provides bolding the output for the various stages.  change the check for java to be enabled by default.  fix the high-optimization conflict with profiling (cannot omit frame pointer). rework the java tests some.  add a YFLAGS for -d

	* doc/html/manuals/ReleaseNotes/Makefile.am, doc/html/manuals/Makefile.am:
	remove the empty ReleaseNotes directory

	* src/gtools/g_qa.1, src/gtools/g_qa.c:
	Since the user community didn't ask for the -s option I've deleted it for now.
	It can be implemented, but doesn't seem worth the time right now.  Given the
	existence of the -g and -n options, I suspect the -s option isn't necessary.

	Incorporated Janine's comments.  Much more readable now.
	Editors are really wonderful people to have around!
	Broke with the g_lint tradition of specifying reports as a bit mask.
	The user community really doesn't know the first thing about binary
	these days, so we shouldn't mandate they learn about it to work with
	the user interface (even a command-line user interface).

	add initial whereis and which functionality to libbu via whereis.c and which.c respectively.  the difference of course being that bu_whereis() searches the system path, while bu_which() searches the user path.  still could use some more work to clean up the paths being returned, but it is functional for an initial implementation.

d76 2
a77 2
	* src/tclscripts/mged/mged.tcl:
	dang fixed path .. use bu_brlcad_data to find the root.  these routines still need to check for existence in order so users may need to edit/modify their existing .mgedrc if they have one in the meantime.

	the BRL-CAD documentation is available under a dual-license strategy allowing for recepients to choose between the GFDL and GPL.  this allows for the documentation to be included on otherwise opaque distribution mediums and over-zealous packaging distributions that don't seem to agree with allowing minor invariant sections (which none of brl-cad's docs have anyways).

	make the DSP primitive use less memory when data is coming from a binunif. allocating 160 times binunif size is a bit extravagant (which comes from sizeof(struct dsp_bb)).

	* BUGS:
	bu_malloc() function and company take an unsigned int argument and will overflow without notification (since it is unsigned) resulting in less memory allocated than one requested.  should probably use a size_t like malloc or add better support to increase the types to long or long long signed.

	* src/rt/rtarea.1:
	document the new rtarea output including details on the difference between presented and exposed surface areas, this implements sf request 1225052 from dwaynelk

	* src/rt/viewarea.c:
	Shazam.  This makes a fairly extensive improvement (pretty much a rewrite) of rtarea to report both the presented and exposed area projections for both regions and assemblies.  The regions are sorted alphabetically, the assemblies are indented by maximum encountered visitation depth (which isn't the same as the construction hierarchy, but good enough for organizing the list somewhat), and the number of hits are reported as well.  more work is needed to alphabetize the assembly levels as well as reduce some of the code duplication.

	improve detection and handling of cyclic geometry references.  this prevents mged and other tools from blowing the stack when someone inadvertently or intentionally creates a cyclic reference (potentially deep).  (related to sf bug/request 1173554 and 1219294)

	* src/librt/db_tree.c:
	Detect cyclic geometry references when looking up geometry and handle in a mostly-graceful manner.  Instead of letting the functions continue recursively until the stack is blown, mark the first instance of the cycle as a no-op and blather the details of the cycle.

	* src/libwdb/wdb.c: Use __int64 instead of long long if pure Windows

	* include/raytrace.h: Add dgo_freeSolids member to struct dg_obj

	* src/librt/dg_obj.c:
	FreeSolid is no longer visible outside of librt. I need access to it from a library outside of BRL-CAD, so I added another member to struct dg_obj (i.e. dgo_freeSolids) that points to FreeSolid.

	Since the user community didn't ask for the -s option I've deleted it for now.
	It can be implemented, but doesn't seem worth the time right now.  Given the
	existence of the -g and -n options, I suspect the -s option isn't necessary.

	* src/gtools/g_qa.1:
	Incorporated Janine's comments.  Much more readable now.
	Editors are really wonderful people to have around!
	Broke with the g_lint tradition of specifying reports as a bit mask.
	The user community really doesn't know the first thing about binary
	these days, so we shouldn't mandate they learn about it to work with
	the user interface (even a command-line user interface).

	* src/libbu/Makefile.am, src/libbu/whereis.c, src/libbu/which.c:
	add initial whereis and which functionality to libbu via whereis.c and which.c respectively.  the difference of course being that bu_whereis() searches the system path, while bu_which() searches the user path.  still could use some more work to clean up the paths being returned, but it is functional for an initial implementation.
d375 2

d105 1

d107 2
a108 2
	* src/rt/rtedge.1, src/rt/viewedge.c:

d110 1
a110 2
	* src/rt/opt.c:

a348 2
	* src/mged/mged.1:
	document the new -f option for preventing the background detachment.
d351 32

	add a -f option to mged to prevent it from automatically detaching on startup -- this is often very useful for logging or debugging.  also, make the backgrounding notice wait until the gui is up and running before exiting instead of sleeping an arbitrary amount of time -- the child notifies the parent when the gui is up.

	add variance/deviation checks to the benchmarks so that after we reach a minimum timeframe per run, it may continue rendereing extra frames until the numbers on the performance results of the last run are within some deviation percentage of the average previous N frames.  initial testing shows that this results in a MUCH more stable/repeatable rtfm than before.

	refactor the benchmarks into a functional form to ensure consistency across all the tests as the testing becomes more complicated (e.g. for adding variance/deviation checks and superscaling).  this should be posix shell compliant, hopefully most all platform /bin/sh these days are minimally compliant too.  function form happens to shave a couple hundred lines off the file too.. ;)

	glXCreateContext might not be able to make a direct context, so don't presume that it will.  if it's not, we need to turn on the multiple_windows flag so that the context is properly acquired/released.  this fixes a bus error crash on the macs, as well as other oddities on some other platforms.  this is possibly related to sf bug 925427 where the entire X display would go black until the raytrace completes.

	disable PARALLEL on windows again until the appropriate win32 calls can be added to parallel.c/semaphore.c in libbu, not enough to rely on cygwin's pthreading wrapping

	* BUGS:
	rtarea bug should be squished now.  it still uses the global, but should not be doing the forking any more unless it's required -- and if it does fork, it will force rtarea to single-threaded so values are properly computed.

	instead of scaling over time, a backwards-compatible solution that provides the same results was to simply hypersample without jitter.  an interesting benchmark improvement would be to continue the renders until the rtfm variance is below some threshold.

	major reworking of the benchmark to iteratively double the number of rays being fired until the individual test requires takes at least a minimum predetermined amount of wallclock time (currently set to 60 seconds per test).  the number of rays is doubled via hypersampling 1+N hypersample rays with jitter disabled.  the amount of time may be specified via the TIMEFRAME environment variable.  having the longer run time will help the rtfm numbers stabilize better and lets the benchmark scale better to faster machines.  an interesting addition for the future might be to compute the mean error deviation between frames and use that as well to get a stable rtfm metric.

	* configure.ac:
	add checks for automatic termlib detection supplanting the need for the user to install a termlib/termcap/curses library so the build should no longer fail for that reason (since it will build it if it's not found).  rename the png and regex ac_subst defines while we're at it for consistency.  also force tk to on for real..

	initial termlib library from an early original bsd implementation (that predated the name change to libtermcap).  preserve the name termlib instead of termcap to reduce confusion with the gnu termcap library implementation.  these particular sources were originally taken from the traditional vi project, though they have already been patched.

	* src/rt/do.c, src/rt/viewedge.c, include/bu.h, include/machine.h:
	add explicit build support for sparc64

	* sh/make_pkg.sh:
	add the trailing slash for cp so that the contents are copied instead of the whole dir

	* misc/macosx/Resources/ReadMe.rtfd/brlcad_logo_tiny.png, misc/macosx/Resources/Welcome.rtfd/brlcad_logo_tiny.png:
	update the logo to add a halo effect for emphasis/clarity around 'BRL-CAD'

	* misc/macosx/Makefile.am: add README and background.png

	* misc/macosx/README:
	initial README that describes the contents of this directory

	* misc/macosx/background.png:
	initial disk image background image for Finder window on mount

	* sh/make_pkg.sh:
	copy the package from /tmp to the build directory when we're done making it

	* sh/make_dmg.sh:
	a pkg in the build directory takes precedence over one in /tmp

2005-04-10  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/make_dmg.sh:
	improvement to set the background image, find the alternate pkg dir in /tmp, and create a sparse dmg image instead of a fixed-size dmg.

	* Makefile.am: spell version right

	* sh/make_pkg.sh:
	improvement that allows the script to work with NFS mounted home directories, defaulting to try making the package in /tmp.  if an existing package exists, they are warned now and asked if they want to delete it.

	* configure.ac:
	JAVA_CFLAGS must be in the CPPFLAGS when the jni.h header is searched for...

2005-04-07  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/make_dmg.sh:
	SWEET! It now has the basic components and will create a DMG on demand.  It still does not do anything with the background image yes thought it does detect it.  The script also does not run misc/macosx/openUp yet either.  Still, sweet progress.

	* sh/make_pkg.sh: give the script a name when restarting via sudo

2005-04-06  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* sh/make_dmg.sh:
	initial stub of a dmg script with potential to actually do something useful

	* Makefile.am:
	use top_srcdir so that the package scripts can be run when building from a different dir; fix make_dmg.sh, feed it a background image

	* sh/make_pkg.sh: wording of title and name

2005-04-05  brlcad  <brlcad@@users.sourceforge.net>

	* NEWS:
	removed redirection usage examples in g2asc docs.  outputting the object name when the root solver fails actually didn't make the 7.2.2 release apparently due to a misunderstanding on my part so remove from list.

	* src/conv/g2asc.1, src/conv/g2asc.c:
	if the converter isn't going to let me do stdio redirection any more, the usage and manpage need to reflect that

	* HACKING:
	BRL-CAD is a meritocracy.  BRL-CAD uses a monthly iteration cycle.  Mention make test too.

	hack to work around the irix compiler crashing on the libtool btclsh relink attempt when we get to tclscripts.  this lets all of the pkgIndex and tclIndex scripts get generated during the build so the build doesn't halt (should be mipspro-specific as it's a compiler crash on relink)

d32 2
a33 2
	* /cvsroot/brlcad/brlcad/NEWS:
	fixed rtedge/rtwizard background render failure bug where the -c set background option would not behave as expected (it seemingly did nothing).  the problem is related to different way rtedge deals with the background compared to rt -- rt uses a float triplet, rtedge was trying to use an int triplet.  code changes from some time ago made all background modifiers use liboptical's (float triplet) global, which resulted in the bug.  the int triplet was reinstated, though rtedge should probably be modified to do what rt does.  this fixes sf bug 1172633.
d35 2
a36 2
	* /cvsroot/brlcad/brlcad/src/rt/viewedge.c:
	arrrrgh!!!  rtedge was using a global named background, which was removed when liboptical picked up the rt background variable of the same name.  the problem is that rtedge was using a triplet of ints, rt/liboptical used/uses a triplet of floats! .. this caused the set command struct parse variable setting to not work quite as was intended... resulting in the background never changing from black.  this fixes the problem by reinstating rtedges global int triplet but lets call it bgcolor now.. (addresses sf bug 1172633)  should probably make rtedge do what rt does eventually.

	remove rdebug, AbientIntensity, spectrum, and background from libmultispectral as those defines are (at least now) coming from liboptical's init.c.  this avoids duplicate symbol and initialization scope errors

	if a secondary autoconf fails with an error saying that AC_PROG_LIBTOOL is missing, pull the misc/libtool.m4 in as an acinclude.m4 and restart the configuration.  this should allow a successful autogen on systems that have a libtool that's already moved forward to LT_INIT or otherwise don't have the AC_PROG_LIBTOOL macro.

	add a libtool.m4 just in case the compiling user has a libtool installed that's already converted to LT_INIT or a setup that is otherwise missing the AC_PROG_LIBTOOL macro.  it's not a good idea to put the libtool.m4 into the m4/ directory as that may cause automake variable mismatch bugs (where the libraries end up missing their extensions) when there's a suitable system libtool.m4 already.
