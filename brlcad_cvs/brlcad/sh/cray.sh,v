#  This shell script is intended for use with the MGED "rrt"    #
#  (remote RT) command.  It takes the local copy of the model   #
#  database, converts it to ASCII, and sends it over the        #
#  network to a compute server machine (at BRL, usually either  #
#  a Cray or Alliant), where it is converted back into a binary #
#  file in /tmp.  RT (on the compute server) is started, with   #
#  the viewing matrix provided on stdin, from the MGED rrt      #
#  command.                                                     #
#                                                               #
#  If the environment variable FB_FILE is set before MGED is    #
#  run, then we arrange to force the image to be routed to that #
#  display (it better be in host:device form!).  This can be    #
#  overriden by supplying a -F option to the "rrt" command.     #
#                                                               #
#  If the environment variable COMPUTE_SERVER is set before     #
#  MGED is run, that network host is used to perform the        #
#  raytracing.  Otherwise, BRL's XMP48 is used by default.      #
#  This can be altered from within MGED by specifying the       #
#  -C compute_server flag, which this script intercepts and     #
#  uses to change the default/environment specification.        #
#  The -C flag is not passed on to RT.                          #
#                                                               #
#  The compute server is assumed to have a different floating   #
#  point format than the local machine, hence the conversion    #
#  to ASCII.  The procedure can be simplified for machines of   #
#  identical binary database format.  The procedure becomes     #
#  almost trivial when compatible machines have NFS too.        #
