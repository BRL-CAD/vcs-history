Cake is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any
warranty. No author or distributor accepts responsibility to anyone for
the consequences of using it or for whether it serves any particular purpose
or works at all, unless he/she says so in writing.

Everyone is granted permission to copy, modify and redistribute Cake
under the following conditions:

	Permission is granted to anyone to make or distribute verbatim copies
	of Cake source code as received, in any medium, provided that all
	copyright notices and permission and nonwarranty notices are preserved,
	and that the distributor grants the recipient permission for further
	redistribution as permitted by this document, and gives him/her and
	points out to him/her an exact copy of this document to inform him/her
	of his/her rights.

	Permission is granted to distribute modified versions of Cake source
	code, or of portions of it, under the above conditions, provided also
	that all changed files carry prominent notices stating who last changed
	them and that all the Cake-derived material, including everything
	packaged together with it and not independently usable, is distributed
	under the conditions stated in this document.

	Permission is granted to distribute Cake in compiled or executable form
	under the same conditions applying for source code, provided that either

	A	it is accompanied by the corresponding machine-readable source
		code, or
	B	it is accompanied by a written offer, with no time limit, to
		give anyone a machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
		code in return for reimbursement of the cost of distribution.
		This written offer must permit verbatim duplication by anyone.
	C	it is distributed by someone who received only the executable
		form, and is accompanied by a copy of the written offer of
		source code which he/she received along with it.

In other words, you are welcome to use, share and improve Cake.
You are forbidden to forbid anyone else to use, share and improve
what you give them. Help stamp out software-hoarding!
