.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are intended for access to the multiple interpreter
facility from inside C programs. They enable managing multiple interpreters
in a hierarchical relationship, and the management of aliases, commands
that when invoked in one interpreter execute a command in another
interpreter. The return value for those procedures that return an \fBint\fR
is either \fBTCL_OK\fR or \fBTCL_ERROR\fR. If \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned
then the \fBresult\fR field of the interpreter contains an error message.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateSlave\fR creates a new interpreter as a slave of \fIinterp\fR.
It also creates a slave command named \fIslaveName\fR in \fIinterp\fR which 
allows \fIinterp\fR to manipulate the new slave. 
If \fIisSafe\fR is zero, the command creates a trusted slave in which Tcl
code has access to all the Tcl commands.
If it is \fB1\fR, the command creates a ``safe'' slave in which Tcl code
has access only to set of Tcl commands defined as ``Safe Tcl''; see the
manual entry for the Tcl \fBinterp\fR command for details.
If the creation of the new slave interpreter failed, \fBNULL\fR is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_IsSafe\fR returns \fB1\fR if \fIinterp\fR is ``safe'' (was created
with the \fBTCL_SAFE_INTERPRETER\fR flag specified),
\fB0\fR otherwise.
.PP
\fBTcl_MakeSafe\fR marks \fIinterp\fR as ``safe'', so that future
calls to \fBTcl_IsSafe\fR will return 1.  It also removes all known
potentially-unsafe core functionality (both commands and variables)
from \fIinterp\fR.  However, it cannot know what parts of an extension
or application are safe and does not make any attempt to remove those
parts, so safety is not guaranteed after calling \fBTcl_MakeSafe\fR.
Callers will want to take care with their use of \fBTcl_MakeSafe\fR
to avoid false claims of safety.  For many situations, \fBTcl_CreateSlave\fR
may be a better choice, since it creates interpreters in a known-safe state.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetSlave\fR returns a pointer to a slave interpreter of
\fIinterp\fR. The slave interpreter is identified by \fIslaveName\fR.
If no such slave interpreter exists, \fBNULL\fR is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetMaster\fR returns a pointer to the master interpreter of
\fIinterp\fR. If \fIinterp\fR has no master (it is a
top-level interpreter) then \fBNULL\fR is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetInterpPath\fR sets the \fIresult\fR field in \fIaskingInterp\fR
to the relative path between \fIaskingInterp\fR and \fIslaveInterp\fR;
\fIslaveInterp\fR must be a slave of \fIaskingInterp\fR. If the computation
of the relative path succeeds, \fBTCL_OK\fR is returned, else
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned and the \fIresult\fR field in
\fIaskingInterp\fR contains the error message.
.PP
.VS
\fBTcl_CreateAlias\fR creates an object command named \fIslaveCmd\fR in
\fIslaveInterp\fR that when invoked, will cause the command \fItargetCmd\fR
to be invoked in \fItargetInterp\fR. The arguments specified by the strings
contained in \fIargv\fR are always prepended to any arguments supplied in the
invocation of \fIslaveCmd\fR and passed to \fItargetCmd\fR.
This operation returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if it succeeds, or \fBTCL_ERROR\fR if
it fails; in that case, an error message is left in the object result
of \fIslaveInterp\fR.
Note that there are no restrictions on the ancestry relationship (as
created by \fBTcl_CreateSlave\fR) between \fIslaveInterp\fR and
\fItargetInterp\fR. Any two interpreters can be used, without any
restrictions on how they are related.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateAliasObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_CreateAlias\fR except 
that it takes a vector of objects to pass as additional arguments instead
of a vector of strings.
.VE
.PP
\fBTcl_GetAlias\fR returns information about an alias \fIaliasName\fR
in \fIinterp\fR. Any of the result fields can be \fBNULL\fR, in
which case the corresponding datum is not returned. If a result field is
non\-\fBNULL\fR, the address indicated is set to the corresponding datum.
For example, if \fItargetNamePtr\fR is non\-\fBNULL\fR it is set to a
pointer to the string containing the name of the target command.
.VS
.PP
\fBTcl_GetAliasObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_GetAlias\fR except that it
returns a pointer to a vector of Tcl_Obj structures instead of a vector of
strings.
.PP
\fBTcl_ExposeCommand\fR moves the command named \fIhiddenCmdName\fR from
the set of hidden commands to the set of exposed commands, putting
it under the name
\fIcmdName\fR. 
\fIHiddenCmdName\fR must be the name of an existing hidden
command, or the operation will return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leave an error
message in the \fIresult\fR field in \fIinterp\fR.
If an exposed command named \fIcmdName\fR already exists,
the operation returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leaves an error message in the
object result of \fIinterp\fR.
If the operation succeeds, it returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
After executing this command, attempts to use \fIcmdName\fR in a call to
\fBTcl_Eval\fR or with the Tcl \fBeval\fR command will again succeed.
.PP
\fBTcl_HideCommand\fR moves the command named \fIcmdName\fR from the set of
exposed commands to the set of hidden commands, under the name
\fIhiddenCmdName\fR.
\fICmdName\fR must be the name of an existing exposed
command, or the operation will return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leave an error
message in the object result of \fIinterp\fR.
Currently both \fIcmdName\fR and \fIhiddenCmdName\fR must not contain
namespace qualifiers, or the operation will return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
leave an error message in the object result of \fIinterp\fR.
The \fICmdName\fR will be looked up in the global namespace, and not
relative to the current namespace, even if the current namespace is not the
global one.
If a hidden command whose name is \fIhiddenCmdName\fR already
exists, the operation also returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and the \fIresult\fR
field in \fIinterp\fR contains an error message.
If the operation succeeds, it returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
After executing this command, attempts to use \fIcmdName\fR in a call to
\fBTcl_Eval\fR or with the Tcl \fBeval\fR command will fail.
.PP

\fBTcl_MakeSafe\fR makes \fIinterp\fR ``safe'' by removing all
non-core and core unsafe functionality. Note that if you call this after
adding some extension to an interpreter, all traces of that extension will
be removed from the interpreter.
