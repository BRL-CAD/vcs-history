.SH NAME
resource \- Manipulate Macintosh resources
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBresource \fIoption\fR ?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBresource\fR command provides some generic operations for
dealing with Macintosh resources.  This command is only supported on
the Macintosh platform.  Each Macintosh file consists of two
\fIforks\fR: a \fIdata\fR fork and a \fIresource\fR fork.  You use the
normal open, puts, close, etc. commands to manipulate the data fork.
You must use this command, however, to interact with the resource
fork.  \fIOption\fR indicates what resource command to perform.  Any
unique abbreviation for \fIoption\fR is acceptable.  The valid options
are:
.TP
\fBresource close \fIrsrcRef\fR
Closes the given resource reference (obtained from \fBresource
open\fR).  Resources from that resource file will no longer be
available.
.TP
\fBresource delete\fR ?\fIoptions\fR? \fIresourceType\fR
This command will delete the resource specified by \fIoptions\fR and
type \fIresourceType\fR (see RESOURCE TYPES below).  The options
give you several ways to specify the resource to be deleted.
.RS
.TP
\fB\-id\fR \fIresourceId\fR
If the \fB-id\fR option is given the id \fIresourceId\fR (see RESOURCE
IDS below) is used to specify the resource to be deleted.  The id must 
be a number - to specify a name use the \fB\-name\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-name\fR \fIresourceName\fR
If \fB-name\fR is specified, the resource named
\fIresourceName\fR will be deleted.  If the \fB-id\fR is also
provided, then there must be a resource with BOTH this name and
this id.  If no name is provided, then the id will be used regardless
of the name of the actual resource.
.TP
\fB\-file\fR \fIresourceRef\fR
If the \fB-file\fR option is specified then the resource will be
deleted from the file pointed to by \fIresourceRef\fR.  Otherwise the
first resource with the given \fIresourceName\fR and or
\fIresourceId\fR which is found on the resource file path will be 
deleted.  To inspect the file path, use the \fIresource files\fR command.
.RE
.TP
\fBresource files ?\fIresourceRef\fR?
If \fIresourceRef\fRis not provided, this command returns a Tcl list
of the resource references for all the currently open resource files.
The list is in the normal Macintosh search order for resources.  If 
\fIresourceRef\fR is specified, the command will
return the path to the file whose resource fork is represented by that
token.
.TP
\fBresource list \fIresourceType\fR ?\fIresourceRef\fR?
List all of the resources ids of type \fIresourceType\fR (see RESOURCE
TYPES below).  If \fIresourceRef\fR is specified then the command will
limit the search to that particular resource file.  Otherwise, all
resource files currently opened by the application will be searched.
A Tcl list of either the resource name's or resource id's of the found
resources will be returned.  See the RESOURCE IDS section below for
more details about what a resource id is.
.TP
\fBresource open \fIfileName\fR ?\fIaccess\fR?
Open the resource for the file \fIfileName\fR.  Standard file access
permissions may also be specified (see the manual entry for \fBopen\fR
for details).  A resource reference (\fIresourceRef\fR) is returned
that can be used by the other resource commands.  An error can occur
if the file doesn't exist or the file does not have a resource fork.
However, if you open the file with write permissions the file and/or
resource fork will be created instead of generating an error.
.TP
\fBresource read \fIresourceType\fR \fIresourceId\fR ?\fIresourceRef\fR?
Read the entire resource of type \fIresourceType\fR (see RESOURCE
TYPES below) and the name or id of \fIresourceId\fR (see RESOURCE IDS
below) into memory and return the result.  If \fIresourceRef\fR is
specified we limit our search to that resource file, otherwise we
search all open resource forks in the application.  It is important to
note that most Macintosh resource use a binary format and the data
returned from this command may have embedded NULLs or other non-ASCII
data.
.TP
\fBresource types ?\fIresourceRef\fR?
This command returns a Tcl list of all resource types (see RESOURCE
TYPES below) found in the resource file pointed to by
\fIresourceRef\fR.  If \fIresourceRef\fR is not specified it will
return all the resource types found in every resource file currently
opened by the application.
.TP
\fBresource write\fR ?\fIoptions\fR? \fIresourceType\fR \fIdata\fR
This command will write the passed in \fIdata\fR as a new resource of
type \fIresourceType\fR (see RESOURCE TYPES below).  Several options
are available that describe where and how the resource is stored.
.RS
.TP
\fB\-id\fR \fIresourceId\fR
If the \fB-id\fR option is given the id \fIresourceId\fR (see RESOURCE
IDS below) is used for the new resource, otherwise a unique id will be
generated that will not conflict with any existing resource.  However,
the id must be a number - to specify a name use the \fB\-name\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-name\fR \fIresourceName\fR
If \fB-name\fR is specified the resource will be named
\fIresourceName\fR, otherwise it will have the empty string as the
name.
.TP
\fB\-file\fR \fIresourceRef\fR
If the \fB-file\fR option is specified then the resource will be
written in the file pointed to by \fIresourceRef\fR, otherwise the
most recently open resource will be used.
.TP
\fB\-force\fR
If the target resource already exists, then by default Tcl will not
overwrite it, but raise an error instead.  Use the -force flag to
force overwriting the extant resource.
.RE

.SH "RESOURCE TYPES"
Resource types are defined as a four character string that is then
mapped to an underlying id.  For example, \fBTEXT\fR refers to the
Macintosh resource type for text.  The type \fBSTR#\fR is a list of
counted strings.  All Macintosh resources must be of some type.  See
Macintosh documentation for a more complete list of resource types
that are commonly used.

.SH "RESOURCE IDS"
For this command the notion of a resource id actually refers to two
ideas in Macintosh resources.  Every place you can use a resource Id
you can use either the resource name or a resource number.  Names are
always searched or returned in preference to numbers.  For example,
the \fBresource list\fR command will return names if they exist or
numbers if the name is NULL.

.SH "PORTABILITY ISSUES"
The resource command is only available on Macintosh.
