.SH NAME
benchmark \- runs the BRL-CAD benchmark
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B [OPTION=value] benchmark [command]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The benchmark suite will test the performance of a given system by
iteratively rendering several well-known datasets into 512x512 images
where performance metrics are documented and fairly well understood.
The local machine performance is compared to the base system (called
VGR) and a numeric "VGR" mulitplier of performance is computed.  This
number is a simplified metric from which one may qualitatively compare
cpu and cache performance, versions of BRL-CAD, and different compiler
characteristics.
.PP

Run without any arguments or variables set, the benchmark suite will
run a series of tests where it renders several image frames.  By
default, the benchmark suite will attempt to calibrate the intensity
of the test frames with the performance characteristics of the machine
running the tests.
.PP
There are several \fBOPTION\fR environment variables that will modify
how the BRL-CAD benchmark behaves so that it may be run in a
stand-alone environment:
.PP
\&
.B RT
\- the ray-trace binary (e.g. ../src/rt/rt or /usr/brlcad/bin/rt)
.br
\&
.B DB
\- the directory containing the reference geometry (e.g. ../db)
.br
\&
.B PIX
\- the directory containing the reference images (e.g. ../pix)
.br
\&
.B LOG
\- the directory containing the reference logs (e.g. ../pix)
.br
\&
.B CMP
\- the name of a pixel comparison tool (e.g. ./pixcmp or cmp)
.br
\&
.B ELP
\- the name of an elapsed time tool (e.g. ../sh/elapsed.sh)
.br
\&
.B TIMEFRAME
\- minimum number of seconds each ray-trace frame should take
.br
\&
.B MAXTIME
\- maximum number of seconds to spend on any test
.br
\&
.B DEVIATION
\- minimum sufficient % deviation from the average
.br
\&
.B AVERAGE
\- how many frames to average together
.br
\&
.B VERBOSE
\- turn on extra debug output (set to yes)
.br
\&
.B QUIET
\- turn off all output (set to yes)
.PP
The \fITIMEFRAME\fR, \fIMAXTIME\fR, \fIDEVIATION\fR, and \fIAVERAGE\fR options control how the
benchmark will proceed including how long it should take.  Each
individual benchmark run will consume at least a minimum \fITIMEFRAME\fR of
wallclock time so that the results can stabilize.  After consuming at
least the minimum \fITIMEFRAME\fR, additional frames may be computed until
the standard deviation from the last \fIAVERAGE\fR count of frames is below
the specified \fIDEVIATION\fR.  When a test is run and it completes in less
than \fITIMEFRAME\fR, the raytrace is restarted using double the number of
rays from the previous run.  If the machine is fast enough, the
benchmark may accelerate the number or rays being fired.  These
additional rays are hypersampled but without any jitter, so it is
effectively performing a multiplier amount of work over the initial
frame.
.PP
There are two \fBcommand\fRs that may be give to the BRL-CAD benchmark
that cause it to peform cleanup actions instead of invoking the
computation tests:
.PP
\&
.B clean
\- remove the test-specific pix and log files
.br
\&
.B clobber
\- same as clean, also benchmark.log files and user is prompted
.br
.PP
When the benchmark completes, output should be saved to several log
files including a 'summary' file containing tabulated results, a
'*benchmark.log' file containing the output from a given run, and
multiple log files for each test frame. Use the \fIclean\fR and
\fIclobber\fR commands during execution to remove the files generated
during the benchmark.
.PP
The \fIclean\fR command removes the test pix and log files.  The
\fIclobber\fR command removes those same files as well as any
*benchmark.log files encountered, and prompting the user beforehand.
The generated tabular \fIsummary\fR file will not be removed
automatically regardless of invocation command.  The \fIsummary\fR
file must be manually deleted.
.SH "REPORTING RESULTS"
.PP
Plese send your BRL-CAD Benchmark results to the developers along with
detailed system information to <devs@@brlcad.org>.  Include at least:
.PP
   0) Compiler name and version (e.g. gcc --version)
   1) CPU configuration (e.g. cat /proc/cpuinfo or hinv or sysctl -a)
   2) Cache (data and/or instruction) details for L1/L2/L3 and system
      (e.g. cat /proc/cpuinfo or hinv or sysctl -a)
   3) All generated log files (i.e. *.log* after benchmark completes)
   4) Anything else you think might be relevant to performance
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.B benchmark
.br
   default run of the suite, taking approximately 10 minutes
.PP
.B TIMEFRAME=1 benchmark
.br
   quick test run for testing functionality and performance ballpark
.PP
.B DEVIATION=1 TIMEFRAME=60 MAXTIME=600 benchmark
.br
   excessive analysis, attempt to stabilize within 1 percent deviation
with each frame taking at least 60 seconds but no more than 10 minutes
per test (the entire analysis will probably take 30 to 60 minutes)
.PP
.B benchmark clean
.br
   delete all of the log and pix image files generated during a
benchmark analysis, leaving only the summary file and any
*benchmark.log files

@add support for automatic logging of benchmark results to a file.  this is so users don't have to rerun and/or manually capture output if they want to review the output in detail.  also included is the date/time and uname of the system running the analysis.  make the file path searching output verbose-only now.  docs updated to reflect all these changes.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
