@.TH SUN-PIX 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
sun\(hypix \-
convert Sun bitmaps from screendump(1) into pix(5) or bw(5) raster image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sun-pix
.RB [ \-b ]
.RB [ \-h ]
.RB [ \-i ]
.RB [ \-P ]
.RB [ \-v ]
[sun.bitmap]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sun-pix
is a program to take Sun bitmap files created with Sun's
.IR screendump (1)
command, and convert them to a
.IR pix (5)
format file.  If the
.B \-b
flag is specified, a
.IR bw (5)
format file is created instead.
The dimensions of the input file are the dimensions of the output
file;  invoking
.I sun-pix
with the
.B \-h
flag will cause the size of the image to be printed without further
processing of the input, or generation of any other output.
The image size is output as a pair
of command line options (\fIie,\fB -w1152 -n900\fR) suitable
for use with other
.IR brlcad (1)
tools such as
.IR pix-fb (1).
When the
.B \-v
flag is specified, all the fields of the header are printed on stderr,
to aid debugging.  Note that the ``encoded'' format is not supported.
.PP
Specifying the
.B \-i
flag will invert the sense of a one-bit wide input image, \fIie\fR,
exchanging black for white.  The default Sun image is black print on
white background; the
.B \-i
flag will give a white image on black background, which is often better
for purposes of creating overlays to be composited with
.IR pixmerge (1)
on top of color images.
.PP
The
.B \-P
flag indicates that the input is a pure bitmap with no Sun-style header
on it.  The first bit to be processed will be the most significant bit (MSB),
\fIie\fR, the left-most bit in the byte.
.PP
Note that the input file is expected to be in Sun (``network'') byte order
(\fIie\fR, ``big-endian'', with byte 0 on the left), regardless
of the byte order of the machine running this program.
.SH BUGS
24-bit images are not supported yet.
