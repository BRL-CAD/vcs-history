.SH NAME
pl\(hysgi \- display UnixPlot on a Silicon Graphics workstation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pl-sgi
.RB [ \-f ]
.RB [ \-n ]
.RB [ \-t\  thickness]
[unix_plot]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pl-sgi
runs only on the Silicon Graphics 3030 and 4D series workstations.
It takes an extended UnixPlot file or files as input and draws
then on the display.  If your system has a knob and button box
the knobs control rotations and translations and the button box
has several pre-defined views and options built in.  Specifically,
the left row of knobs from top down are X, Y, and Z rotations,
and the right row are X, Y, and Z translations and Scale.  The
top row of buttons are: ortho view, perspective view, and reset
view, and the lower two rows of buttons are the same predefined
orientations that the
.IR mged (1)
editor uses.
.PP
The
.B \-n
flag indicates that the plot is intended for display at NTSC
resolution.  The display hardware is set for NTSC video output.
The
.B \-t
flag specifies the thickening (pixel width) of each line.
By default, lines are only a single pixel wide.
A thickness value of one or two is usually good when making 35mm
slides, while a thickness value of three or four is usually best
when making NTSC videotape recordings.
.PP
The three mouse button are: left - zoom out (.5x smaller), middle
- zoom in (2x larger), right - gives you a small menu of options.
The default choice is to center the current point (the one under
the cursor at the time of the mouse press).  Menu options also
include turning coordinate axis on and off, and outputting the current
"center" point after each repaint (although in 3D with combined
rotates and translates you will probably find this value to be
of little use).  If you have a Dunn Instruments film recorder
connected to your workstation, and the
.IR dunnsnap (1)
program is installed, then a menu selection can be made to snap
a picture of the current view.
.PP
If you are running under a window system (which SGI seems to force
you to do these days) then the
.B \-f
option tells the program to use the full screen for its display, i.e.
it creates a window with the borders just beyond the edge of the
display.
.SH "SALES HYPE"
The full power of floating point plotting can be seen in this kind
of environment, where multiple plots can be overlayed in their
natural coordinate scale, and one can zoom in or out over several
orders of magnitude without loss of precision.
.SH BUGS
The predefined views also change the centering and scale; they
should only affect the rotation.  There is no substitute yet
for the knob and button box for those that don't have one.
Even though this program has been growing new features for some
time, there are still many things on our wish list that it doesn't
do.
