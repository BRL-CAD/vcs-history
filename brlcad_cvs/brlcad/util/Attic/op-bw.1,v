@.TH OP-BW 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
op\(hybw \- read an image from the Optronics Scanner
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B op-bw
.RB [ \-hv ]
.RB [ \-S\  step]
.RB [ \-x\  xoffset]
.RB [ \-y\  yoffset]
.RB [ \-s\  squaresize]
.RB [ \-w\  width]
.RB [ \-n\  height]
> file.bw
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Op-bw
will read an image from an Optronics Scanner and save it in a
.IR bw (5)
format file.
.PP
By default, the output
.I bw
file will be 512x512 pixels.
Specifying the
.B \-h
flag changes the default to 1024x1024.
The
.B \-s
flag will set both the file height and width to be the given size, while
.B \-w
and
.B \-n
sets them individually.
.PP
The "width" or x axis runs around the drum of the scanner, and the
height or y axis runs along the length of the drum.  The region
saved from the scanner can be offset in x and y by some number of
pixels by using the
.B \-x
and
.B \-y
flags.
.PP
The pixel size is set by the iris wheel on the Optronics.  The x spacing
(around the drum) is set by the dial on the front pannel.  The y spacing
is controlled by the step 
count, which is in multiples of 12.5 microns.  A step count of 4 (or 50
microns) is the default.  This y spacing can be changed via the
.B \-S
flag.
Your choices of resolution in microns,
along with the corresponding step count and resolution in "dots per inch"
are as follows:
.sp 1
.nf
Microns  Step    Dpi
 12.5     1     2032
 25       2     1016
 50       4      508
100       8      254
200      16      127
400      32       63.5
