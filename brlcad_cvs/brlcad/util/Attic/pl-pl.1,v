.SH NAME
pl\(hypl \- convert an extended to a simple UnixPlot file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pl-pl
.RB [ \-v ]
.RB [ \-S ]
< unix_plot > unix_plot
.SH DESCRIPTION
UnixPlot is a simple machine and device independent plotting file
format found on both System V and BSD Unix systems.  BRL has extended
that format to include color, three dimensional plotting, machine
independent floating point coordinates, and a flush command for
interactive output.
.PP
.I Pl-pl
converts an extended UnixPlot file to the simpler format for
use by older, and non-extended, programs.  It drops color and
flush commands, strips the Z coordinate of 3D commands, and
converts floating point coordinates to integer.  By default to
integer conversion is done by simple truncation.  If the
.B \-S
option is given, the "space" command in the plot file is used to
center and scale the plot to the full 16 bit signed interger plotting
space (-32767 to +32767).  This is particularly useful for converting
floating point files.  The
.B \-v
verbose option causes each plot command to be described as it is being
converted.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A warning message is given if the input plot file did not contain
a space command since most older UnixPlot programs require them.
