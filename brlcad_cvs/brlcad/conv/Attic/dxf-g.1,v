@.TH DXF-G 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
dxf-g \- DXF Translator (DXF to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dxf-g
[-c] [-d] [-v] [-s scale_factor] [-t tolerance] file.dxf database.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dxf-g\^
converts the specified
.I file.dxf
to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file.
The
.I -c
option specifies that only the first color seen for a layer should be used. Without this option,
layers may be broken into seperate BOT primitives according to color assigned.
The
.I -d
option sets a debug flag. The only effect is to cause a core dump on failure.
This is probably not useful except for developers.
The
.I -v
option produces very verbose output on stderr.
The
.I -s
option provides a scale factor to be applied to the DXF input. This can be used for DXF files
that do not provide units information.
The
.I -t
option specifies the maximum distance (in mm) between two vertices at which the two vertices
will be considered to be the same vertex.
The
.I file.dxf
file is expected to be in the Autodesk DXF format as defined in the
Autocad 2000 manuals. This converter handles entities of type POLYLINE, VERTEX, LINE, CIRCLE, ARC, and 3DFACE.
The POLYLINE entities in AUTOCAD are actually a container for numerous different entity types. The types
of POLYLINE entities converted include 3D polylines, 3D polygon meshes, and polyface meshes.
Each layer is converted to a seperate opbject. Colors are also converted.

.I -l
option prevents processing the DXF file by layers. Some DXF files
may have different layers for different pieces of the object. This
option will result in a single object built from the entire DXF file.
If an input file is not specified, the -l option must be used.
The
.I -n
option directs the code to try to fix surface normal directions. A routine
will be called after each object is built to insure that the surface normals
are at least consistent. If the object is a closed surface, the routine
will assign outward pointing normals to each face.
