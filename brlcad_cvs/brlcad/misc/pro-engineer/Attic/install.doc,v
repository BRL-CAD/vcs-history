@move the Pro/Engineer plugin from misc/pro-engineer to src/external/ProEngineer.  the new src/external directory is intended for all of the codes that are written to work with and link against external packages (often as a plugin to said external package)

@	The Pro/Engineer to BRL-CAD conversion is a two step process.
First, in Pro/Engineer, you must select "Proe-brl" under the "File"
menu.  You will be prompted for an output file name, a starting region
ident number, a maximum allowed error for the facetization
approximation, and an angle control. The recomended value for the
angle control is 0.5.  After all prompts have been satisfied, the
currently displayed model will be output to a file in BRL-CAD ACSII
format (actually a Tcl script). The output file can then be converted
to BRL-CAD by using "asc2g" or by sourcing the file in MGED using the
"source" command.


	To inform Pro/Engineer about the Pro/Toolkit code that
produces ASCII file, you need to create a "protk.dat" file as
follows:

line 1:name proe-brl
line 2:startup spawn
line 3:exec_file 'full path to wherever you install the proe-brl executable'
line 4:text_dir 'full path to the "text" directory'
line 5:revision 2001
line 5:description Convert currently displayed model to BRL-CAD
line 7:end

	See "protk.dat" in this directory for an example. The
exec_file must inlcude the name of the executable file, and the
text_dir must include the name of the "text" directory. In the "text"
directory Pro/Engineer will look for a subdirectory named "usascii"
for a file named "usermsg.txt". The "text" directory in this directory
should be used or at least copied verbatim to where you want to use it.

	The "protk.dat" file must be located where Pro/Engineer will look for it.
Pro/Engineer will look in your current directory and in Pro/Engineer's "text"
directory (as well as a few other places).

	If the "protk.dat" file, the "proe-brl" executable, and the
"usermsg.txt" files are installed properly, you will see the message
"Installation of Proe-BRL converter succeeded" in the Pro/Engineer
message window when Pro/E starts.
