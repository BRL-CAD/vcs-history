@dawn of a new revision.  it shall be numbered 14 to match release 7.  begin the convergence by adding emacs/vi local variable footer blocks to encourage consistent formatting.

@enigma is a one-rotor machine designed along the lines of the original
Enigma mechanical cipher system, only considerably trivialized.  It is
a public domain drop-in replacement for the UNIX "crypt" command.

This version has been upgraded to function properly on 64-bit
machines.  It has been upgrade to use an makekey and to test for
backwards-compatible operation of crypt(), rather than the MD5
version.  Also, this version is modified to detect illegal
salt/password characters.

Run ./build.sh to process the autotools, configure the build, and
compile engima all in one swoop.  If all goes well, there will be an
enigma binary waiting for you.  See the manpage for more details.
