1.1
log
@automake has a braindead auto-inclusion of ChangeLog files that is causing make distcheck to fail when trying to include the debian 'changelog' file.  avoid the whole issue and make the file more generalized (auto-sets the version and time now) by turning it into an autoconf template instead.
