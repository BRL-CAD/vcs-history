@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

\f2\b \ul Overview\
\pard\tx1440\tx2880\tx4320\tx5760\tx7200\ql\qnatural

\f1\b0 \cf0 \ulnone BRL-CAD consists primarily of libraries, applications, scripts, documentation, geometric models, images, and build infrastructure. The BRL-CAD libraries include the headers in the include/ directory as well as all of the directories that begin with the prefix "lib" in the src/ directory (e.g. src/librt/).  All of BRL-CAD's applications and libraries are covered by the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation unless noted otherwise in the source files.\
\
Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure (i.e. files required by the GNU Build System such as the configure.ac and all Makefile.am files), a variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/ directories, and the testing infrastructure (scripts and resources) are provided either under the BSD license or are in the public domain.  Refer to each individual file for specific terms.\
\
BRL-CAD's documentation consists of manual pages located throughout the package, most of the files in the doc/ directory, and the top-level administrative project text files (e.g. README & AUTHORS).  Unless otherwise denoted, all of BRL-CAD's documentation is made available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) or, at your option, under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 as published by the Free Software Foundation.  Several older documents (e.g. published by the U.S. Government prior to being released as Open Source) are in the public domain.  Refer to each document and the original author(s) individually for specific terms.\
\
Unless previously described or otherwise already covered by another license, the BRL-CAD package is covered under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 as published by the Free Software Foundation.  This includes but is not limited to the applications, geometric models, images, and other resource data included in the BRL-CAD distribution.\
\
The full text of the GPL, LGPL, GFDL, and BSD license should be included in the source distribution of BRL-CAD in the doc/legal/ directory.  Refer to the full license text for more details, information, and implications of each license.\

\
8.  The RECIPIENT shall indemnify and hold harmless THE GOVERNMENT for any loss, claim, damage, expense, or liability of any kind occurring as a result of the making, using, or selling of a product, process, or service by or on behalf of RECIPIENT, its assignees and licensees, which was derived from BRL-CAD.\
\
9.  ARL will be credited should BRL-CAD be used in a product or written about in any publication.  ARL will be referenced as the original source for BRL-CAD, however, the RECIPIENT shall not in any way imply that THE GOVERNMENT endorses any product or service of the RECIPIENT.\
\
