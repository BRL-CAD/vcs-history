.SH NAME
mk_bolt \- creates an mged file containing bolts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mk_bolt
[ options... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Mk_bolt is a program to create an mged data base of one of four
different kinds of bolts.  Up to twenty-six bolts of one type
and size may
be created.  Mk_bolt uses libwdb to create an mged data base.  This
program may be run interactively or the user may specify options on
a command line.  If the user chooses to run the program interactively
he answers the questions as the program prompts him.  Below are the
options that can be used on the command line.
.SS Options
.TP "\w'-G ``n cflag gflag vsize\'\'\     |'u"
.BI \-o#\^
Type of bolt to be created:  1=>bolt head; 2=>bolt head and washer;
3=>bolt head, washer, and bolt stem; and 4=>bolt head and bolt stem.
.TP
.BI \-fname.g\^
Mged file name.
.TP
.BI \-n#\^
The number of bolts to be created.  This number must be less than or
equal to 26 (or it will be set to 26).
.TP
.BI \-hd#\^
Diameter of bolt head flat edge to flat edge in millimeters.
.TP
.BI \-hh#\^
Height of bolt head in millimeters.
.TP
.BI \-wd#\^
Diameter of washer in millimeters.
.TP
.BI \-wh#\^
Height of washer in millimeters.
.TP
.BI \-sd#\^
Diameter of bolt stem in millimeters.
.TP
.BI \-sh#\^
Height of bolt stem in millimeters.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example from an interactive session.
.sp
.nf
$ mk_bolt
Enter option:
	1 - bolt head
	2 - bolt head & washer
	3 - bolt head, washer, & stem
	4 - bolt head & stem
1
Enter name of mged file to be created (25 char max).
	bolt.g
Enter the number of bolts to be created (26 max).
	3
Enter diameter (flat edge to flat edge) & height of bolt head.
	30 10

option:  1 - bolt head
.g file:  bolt.g
head diameter:  30.000000, & height:  10.000000
washer diameter:  0.000000, & height:  0.000000
stem diameter:  0.000000, & height:  0.000000
number of bolts:  3

.fi
The following is the same example where all dimensions are on the
command line.
.nf

	mk_bolt -o1 -fbolt.g -n3 -hd30 -hh10

.fi
In both these examples three bolt heads (option 1) are created with
a diameter of 30mm and a height of 10mm.  The mged file created in
each case is bolt.g.
