@.TH MK_GASTANK 1 BRL/CAD
.SH NAME
mk_gastank \- creates an mged file containing gas tanks.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mk_gastank
[ options... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Mk_gastank is a program to create an mged data base of gas tanks.
Up to twenty-six gas tanks of the same size may
be created.  These gas tanks are solid with rounded corners and
edges.  They are appropriate for use with millimeter wave
signature analysis.  They are not appropriate of infra red or
vulnerability analysis.  Mk_gastank uses libwdb to create an mged data base.
The gas tanks are composed of three arb8s, eight spheres, and twelve
cylinders.  This
program may be run interactively or the user may specify options on
a command line.  If the user choose to run the program interactively
he answers the questions as the program prompts him.  Below are the
options that can be used on the command line.
.SS Options
.TP "\w'-G ``n cflag gflag vsize\'\'\     |'u"
.BI \-fname.g\^
Mged file name.
.TP
.BI \-n#\^
The number of gas tanks to be created.  This number must be less than or
equal to 26.
.TP
.BI \-h#\^
Height of gas tank in millimeters.
.TP
.BI \-w#\^
Width of gas tank in millimeters.
.TP
.BI \-d#\^
Depth of gas tank in millimeters.
.TP
.BI \-r#\^
Radius of the corner in millimeters.
.TP
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example from an interactive session.
.sp
.nf
$ mk_gastank

This program constructs a solid gas tank with all
edges and corners rounded.

Enter the name of the mged file to be created (25 char max).
	gastank.g
Enter the number of gas tanks to create (26 max).
	3
Enter the height, width, and depth of the gas tank.
	300 200 400
Enter the radius of the corners.
	30

mged file name:  gastank.g
height of gas tank:  300.000000 mm
width of gas tank:  200.000000 mm
depth of gas tank:  400.000000 mm
radius of corner:  30.000000 mm
number of gas tanks:  3

.fi
The following is the same example where all dimensions are on the
command line.
.nf

	mk_gastank -fgastank.g -n3 -h300 -w200 -d400 -r30

.fi
In both these examples three gas tanks are created with
a height of 300mm, a width of 200mm, a depth of 400mm, and
a radius for the corner of 30mm.  The mged file created in
each case is gastank.g.
