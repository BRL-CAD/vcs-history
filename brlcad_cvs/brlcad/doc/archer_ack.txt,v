Archer was developed by SURVICE Engineering under the Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant AF03-141 (reference contract FA8651-04-C-0137) under the supervision of Lt. Edwin Rodriguez (AFRL/MNAL) (reference crossbow.survice.com).

Archer is built upon BRL-CAD.  SURVICE would like to acknowledge the contribution and support from the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) BRL-CAD Development Team, without which Archer would not be possible.

The following is the Archer Development Team:
- Bob Parker: Principal programmer
- Doug Howard: Original coding
- Keith Bowman: Architecture
- Steve Phillips: Website and Software Change Request (SCR) tracking system
- Mark Butkiewicz: Project Management
