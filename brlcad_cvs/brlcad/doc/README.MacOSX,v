@BRL-CAD on Max OS X README
==========================

Being that this is one of the newest architectures to be added and
officially supported, there are some issues to keep in mind with the
installation when building from the sources.  Beyond the notes
provided here, building on Mac OS X can generally be considered the
same as the UNIX, BSD, and Linux platforms.

Table of Contents
-----------------
  Introduction

  X11 Window Server
  Supported Versions
  Mac OS X 10.2
  Parallel Builds
  Bugs


X11 Window Server
-----------------
You'll need to install an X11 server if you would like to build Tk and
have a graphical user interface.  Apple's X11 is the recommended X
Window Server, though XDarwin should work suitably as well.  Be sure
to install the developer headers and libraries from the X11 Software
Developers Kit (SDK), which is usually a separate installation
package.

Supported Versions
------------------
BRL-CAD is generally only "extensively" tested by the developers on
the latest released version of Mac OS X only.  That is to say that
although the BRL-CAD package should build on prior versions of the Mac
OS X operating system, they are generally and eventually not
maintained and will require additional effort to obtain a build.
Compiling on 10.3 or 10.4 should complete successfully.  Due to a
variety of significant application programming interface issues in
early releases of Mac OS X, versions prior to 10.2 are unsupported.

Mac OS X 10.2
-------------
Compiling directly on Mac OS X 10.2 requires additional effort.  When
compiling from source, a libtool script is generated after running
autogen.sh that gets used during compilation.  The version of
glibtoolize shipped with 10.2 is non-functional with respect to
convenience libraries, a feature that BRL-CAD requires.  That means
that you will need to obtain the generated libtool script from other
means.  You can either run autogen.sh on a different machine that has
a newer version of libtool installed or you can download a source
disribution where autogen.sh has already been run for you on a
relatively new system.

Parallel Builds
---------------
As many workstation and server systems shipped by Apple are
multiprocessor systems, you can enjoy the benefits of decreased
compile times by utilizing the "-j" option to make.  After running
configure, run "make -j2" to build on a 2-processor system.

Bugs
----
The only known bugs specific to Mac OS X are limitations of Tk or the
X11 event handler that our generally outside of BRL-CAD's domain.
Refer to BUGS for more general details on known bugs and reporting
mechanisms.

Cheers!

BRL-CAD is generally extensively tested by the developers on the
latest released version of Mac OS X only.  That is to say that
although the package should build on prior versions of the operating
system, they are generally unmaintained.  Due to a variety of
significant application programming interface issues in early releases
of Mac OS X, versions prior to 10.2 are unsupported.

Compiling on Mac OS X 10.2 directly is a known issue and will likely
fail due to various minor build issues.
