@refer to README.VAX for getting BSD running on the VAX platform, mention that BRL-CAD is in the FreeBSD ports system.

@BRL-CAD on BSD README
=====================

Included below are details on building under one of the various BSD
variants.  BRL-CAD is continuously compiled under various variants of
BSD including FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, and even the original
4.3 BSD (though now rare).  See the README.VAX document for additional
details that pertain to building BRL-CAD on a VAX running BSD.

The only compilation issue worth noting, is that newer versions of
libtool have a bug where they do not install the .la files causing
libtool to report warnings.  Examples of such messages in the output
during install include:

libtool: install: warning: `../../src/libfb/libfb.la' has not been installed in `/usr/brlcad/lib'
libtool: install: warning: `../../src/libbu/libbu.la' has not been installed in `/usr/brlcad/lib'

Those warnings are not cause for concern.  A simple workaround to
quell the warnings is to manually copy/install all the .la files in
one step to the install library directory before performing the final
'sudo make install' step:

find . -name \*.la -exec cp {} /usr/brlcad/lib/. \;

After that, a 'sudo make install' (or whatever means you use to go
root) should work just fine and the warnings should go away.

BRL-CAD is included in the FreeBSD Ports system.

@comment on the 'libtool: install: warning: ... .la ... has not been installed in' warnings being spewed by libtool due to some libtool bug that fails to install the .la files.  this bug is not bsd specific, but considerably more frequently observed on bsd since ports has had a never version of libtool for some time now.  seems to be a bug in the newest versions and may be related to not using LT_INIT or using the slightly older libtool.m4 with the newest.  regardless, provide a work around for libtool's lameness.

The only issue that comes to mind, is that newer versions of libtool
have a bug where they do not install the .la files causing libtool to

such as:

Those warnings are not cause for concern.  The install is complete if
that is all that is being reported.  Regardless, a simple workaround
to quell the warnings is to manually copy all the .la files in one
