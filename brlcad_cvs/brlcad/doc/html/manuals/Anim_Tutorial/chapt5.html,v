@<HEAD><TITLE>Animation Techniques in BRL-CAD</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><A NAME="Computing Video Frames">Computing Video Frames</A></H1>
<P>
With the animation tables used in the moving ellipsoid example from Section 3,
we can create all the frames for a full-speed videotape recording.
It is important to avoid file name conflicts between the images created for
the postage stamp animation and the frames for the video.
Either tell rt to create frames with different
names, or the postage stamp
frames must be renamed or removed before computing the video frames.
Failure to do so will cause rt to
believe that the postage stamp frames are completed frames for the video
animation.
In the following example, the
frames will be created with the name ``ell_vid.pix'' to avoid conflict.
<P>
The arguments to the ``times'' command of
<A HREF="chapt9.html#tabinterp">tabinterp</A> is slightly different from the previous
example.  The difference is the number of frames per integer time step
(seconds) is increased from 3 to 30.
<PRE>

file chans.vsize 0;
file chans.eyept 1 2 3;
file chans.orient 4 5 6 7;
file chans.ellanim 8 9 10;

interp spline 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7;
interp linear 8 9 10;

The new prototype contains an invocation of the ``framedone.sh'' script to
process each image as it is completed.

It is likely to be quite a while
before all the images are computed.
The rendering should be done as a batch job or detached process using a
script similar to the ``ell2.rt'' script below.
<PRE>
% <B>cat ell2.rt</B>
<listing>
#!/bin/sh
rt -M -w1440 -n 972 -V1440:972 -J1 -o ell_vid.pix moss.g all.g 2>> ell.log < ell.rtanim
</listing>

% <B>ell2.rt &</B>
</PRE>
For instance it took almost ten hours
to compute and process the 241 1440x972
images of our trivial geometry for an 8 second
animation on a Silicon Graphics 4D/280.
The final compressed images occupied approximately
39 MB of disk space.
