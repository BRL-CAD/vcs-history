@<HEAD><TITLE>Animation Techniques in BRL-CAD</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><A NAME="Abstract">Abstract</A></H1>
<P>
Complex model systems can be difficult to depict using static images.
Some phenomena are not apparent when viewed at a single instance in time.
Many such things become much clearer, easier to detect and understand when
they can be presented as moving, changing, evolving entities.  For this
reason, a set of tools have been created to help users generate motion
picture sequences of systems modeled with BRL-CAD

<P>
Raytracing is a fundamental analysis and
rendering technique within BRL-CAD.
<A HREF="foot_Muuss88a.html"><IMG ALT="*|*" SRC="fn.gif"></A>
Most users of BRL-CAD are acquainted with the use of the
program ``rt'' for creating still images.  A relative
few understand how to utilize its capabilities for generating animation
sequences or ``movies.''
This paper introduces some of the tools and techniques available for
creating animation sequences with ``rt.''
A basic knowledge of BRL-CAD, the geometry editor ``mged'' and
image creation using ``rt'' is assumed.
