<title>AnimMate Track Animation</title>
<body>
<a href="view_tut.html">Previous Section: View Animation</a>
<h1><a name="top">AnimMate Track Animation</a></h1>


AnimMate contains a specialized tool for animating vehicles such as
tanks and bulldozers which have articulated tracks. In this section, you
will use AnimMate to add an articulated track to a tank model, and then
animate the tank.
<p>
If you are editing the moss.g database, from the last section, exit
MGED. For this section, you will need a simple tank model, which is also
included with the BRL-CAD distrubution.
If the BRL-CAD source is located in the "/cadsrc" directory, then you
should execute the following commands to get a copy of the tank model
and open it with MGED:
<pre>
%> asc2g < /cadsrc/db/ktank.asc > anim_tank.g
%> mged anim_tank.g
</pre>
Bring up AnimMate's
<a href="./mmenu.gif">main menu</a>
with the command:
<pre>
mged> animmate
</pre>
<h2><a name="PTModel">Preparing the Model</a></h2>

Before proceeding, there are a few changes that must be applied to the
geometry file to make it animation-ready. The names of the wheels must
be changed to share a common base name, with indexes from zero to six. A
prototype track pad must be created, and sixty copies of the pad must be made
for the left and and right tracks. Save the following file as
<em>track.txt</em>, and then run it using the command:
<pre>
mged> <b>source track.txt</b>
</pre>
<p>

}

#create an animation-ready tank
g anim_tank hull turret anim_wheels pads

</pre>
Note that the file changed the editing units to mm. It is best to work
in these base units during track animation.
<p>
You should see a trapezoidal shape in the MGED display. This is the pad
prototype, named "pad_proto". Display the entire tank with the command:
<pre>
mged> <b>B anim_tank</b>
</pre>
Look at the tank from an
<a href="tut6.png">ae 35,25 view</a>.
<p>
Use the "l" command to look at the contents of anim_tank and its
children. Notice that although anim_tank/pads contains 120 pad objects,
the display seems to show only one, at the origin.
This is because all 120
pads are identical copies of the pad prototype.
The next step is to use
AnimMate to put the pads around the wheels of the model.
<p>
<h2><a name="CTTrack">Creating the Track</a></h2>
In order for AnimMate to do track animation, it must know the position
and size of the wheels defining the track. You need to make a wheel
specification table and place this
information into a table editor. The first three columns of the wheel
spec table specify the positions of the wheel centers, and the fourth
column specifies the wheel radii. The wheels
must be listed in clockwise order as  seen from the right,
starting at the top front of the
vehicle and ending at the top back wheel.
<p>
There are many different methods of obtaining the wheel spec table. For
example, you might center the display on each wheel in turn, and store
the points in an animation curve. You could then put the curve in a
table editor, remove the time column, and add the radius column.
For now, you can just use the two wheel specification files provided
here.

</pre>
From the AnimMate main menu, open two
<a href="teditor.gif">table editors</a>
with the <b>New Editor</b>
option in the <b>TABLE EDITOR</b> menu. Read <em>left_wheels.txt</em> into
text editor 0 by
pressing the <b>Read</b> button, selecting <b>from File</b>, and entering
the file name in the input-request window that pops up. Then read
<em>right_wheels.txt</em> into text editor 1 in the same way.
<p>
Go back to AnimMate's main menu and choose <b>Articulated Track</b>
from the <b>CREATE SCRIPT</b> menu. This creates the
<a href="tscript.gif">track animation window</a>.  Before using this window
to produce animation scripts for the track, you will use it to put the
pads around the wheels in the
model.
<p>
At the bottom of the window, enable the <b>Create geometry file from
frame</b> button.
In the <b>Output file</b> entry box, type <code>left.tcl</code>. Leave
the <b>Vehicle path from table</b> entry box blank for the time being,
and in the <b>Wheel specs from table</b> entry box,
type <code>0</code> for table editor 0.
Leave the wheel base name blank,
since you don't need to change the positions of the wheels in the model.
Enter <code>pads/lpad.</code> (including the ".") for the <b>Pad base name</b>. AnimMate
will obtain the names of all the left pads by adding integer indexes to
this string. For the <b>Number of pads</b>, enter <code>60</code>.
<p>
The next line of the track animation window allows you to specify the
track length. When <b>Minimize track length</b> is specified, the
resulting track is wrapped tightly around the wheels. Select
<b>Elastic track length</b>. With this option, you specify the track
length. Any extra length is taken up by a drooping caternary arc between
wheel zero and wheel (n-1). (This is why wheel zero is always the top
front and wheel (n-1) is always the top back wheel.) If the track length
you specify is too short, the elastic track will be stretched to fit.
Press the <b>Get track length from wheel specs</b> button. The value
<code>13908.27</code> should appear. This is the minimum track length
needed to fit around the wheels listed in the wheel spec table. In order
to give the track a slight droop, modify the track length entry box to
read <code>13925</code>.
<p>
The vehicle is centered more or less at the
origin, and has no yaw, pitch, or roll, so you may leave the next two
lines blank or zero-filled. Double-check that the <b>Create geometry
file from frame</b> button is enabled, and that the corresponding entry
box reads <code>0</code>, and then press <b>OK</b> to create
<em>left.tcl</em>. The newly created file consists of a series of
"arced" commands like the following:
<pre>

</pre>
Source this file in MGED and view the results by re-displaying the tank:
<pre>
mged> <b>source left.tcl</b>
mged> <b>e anim_tank</b>
</pre>
<p>
Sixty track pads should appear around the left wheels of the tank.
Viewed from the side, the track has a slight droop between the two top
wheels.
<p>
Now, repeat the process for the right wheels. Change the name of the output
file to <code>right.tcl</code>, change the wheel spec table to <code>1</code>,
for table editor 1,
and change the pad
base name to <b>pads/rpad.</b>. Press the <b>OK</b> button once
again, then execute the commands:
<pre>
mged> <b>source right.tcl</b>
mged> <b>e anim_tank</b>
</pre>
The
<a href="tut7.png">right track also</a> appears.

<h2><a name="ATTrack">Animating the Track</a></h2>

AnimMate animates articulated tracks such as the two you
created earlier, by producing an animation script which moves the pads and
rotates the wheels. At this point,
you have already provided most of the information needed for such
an animation, but AnimMate still needs to know how far the pads should
be rolled around the wheels in each frame. This information can be
specified directly, or can be inferred from the path of the vehicle
of which the track is a part.
<p>
To directly specify the distance the track should be rolled in each
frame, you would need to create an animation table consisting of a time
column and a distance column. In the distance column, you would specify
the total distance the track should be rolled in each frame. You would
enter the identifier of the animation table next to the label
<b>Vechicle path from table</b>, and select the <b>Distance</b> option
just below that label.
<p>
<h3>Specifying the vehicle path</h3>
More often, you know the path that a vehicle
will take, and you want the track to appear to be driving the
vehicle. This is the method you will use in this tutorial. You will need
to create an animation table specifying the position of the vehicle in
each frame.
<p>
To do this, go to AnimMate's main menu and click on <b>Curve Editor</b>.
Click on the <b>Current curve</b> button and select <b>Rename curve</b>
from the posted menu. In the input-request window that appears, type
<code>path</code> as the new name for the curve. Go to a top view,
and use the ADD button, as explained in a
 <a href="./object_tut.html#EACurves">previous section</a>
of the
tutorial, to create a three-node animation curve
which is less than half the length of the tank. (A short path is best
for demonstrating the motion of the pads).
<a name="spline interp">Press</a> <b>Spline
Interpolate</b> to create an
<a href="./tut8.png">interpolation curve</a> called "spl_path".
(Note: all of the curves drawn by AnimMate appear white in this model,
because the coloring is done by region ident codes, rather than material
properties of the objects. See the MGED edcolor command for
more information.)
<p>
<h3>Animating the vehicle</h3>
Before creating the track scripts, you should make sure that you are
happy with the path that the vehicle will take.
Open a new table editor, and read the contents of the "spl_path" curve
into the editor by clicking on <b>from curve spl_path</b> from the
<b>Read</b> menu.
Go back to the main menu, click on <b>CREATE SCRIPT</b> and then
select <b>Object</b> from the posted menu to pop up the
<a href="./oscript.gif">object animation window</a>.
<p>
Fill in <code>tank.script</code> next to the <b>Output file</b>
label. Select <b>table editor</b> from the <b>Source</b> option menu,
and fill in the identifier of the table editor containing the contents
of "spl_path". For the <b>Object name</b>, put <code>/anim_tank</code>.
Make sure that the <b>Object center</b> and <b>Object
yaw,pitch,roll</b> entries are set to <code>0 0 0</code>, and select
<b>Automatic steering</b> from the <b>Orientation control</b> section.
Now press <b>OK</b> to create <em>tank.script</em>.
Show the script by clicking on <b>Show Script</b> and pressing <b>OK</b>
on the
<a href="sscripts.gif">show script window</a>.
The center of the tank should slide along the path specified by
"spl_path".
<p>
If the preview is too agonizing slow on your display, you might want to
go back to the curve editor, reduce the number of frames per second, and
then redo everything from the
<a href="#spline interp">spline interpolation step</a>. When developing
animations, it is sometimes a good idea to work at a lower frame rate
during the early stages, and then go back and redo the interpolations at
a higher rate when you're sure you've got it right.
<h3>Creating the track scripts</h3>
The next step is to animate the track so that the
tank rolls instead of sliding.
Go back to the track animation window, and
type <code>left.script</code> as the output file.
Next to the <b>Vehicle path from table</b> label,
fill
in the integer identifier of the table editor which contains the
tank's path.
Since the vehicle
path table contains the position of the tank but not the
orientation, select the <b>Position</b> checkbutton on the next line.
Next to the <b>Wheel specs from table</b> entry box, enter
<code>0</code> for table editor 0 (if that is still the table editor which
lists the left wheel positions).
<p>
For the wheel <b>Wheel base name</b>, type
<code>anim_wheels/lw.</code> (don't forget the ".") in the entry box.
The output script will rotate the wheels
as the pads move around them, although the rotation won't be visible
since the wheels are simply cylinders. If the wheel base name is
omitted, then no animation commands are created for the wheels.
<p>
Fill in all of the other entries as you did when creating the left track
model: enter <code>pads/lpad.</code> next to <b>Pad base name</b>,
<code>60</code> next to <b>Number of pads</b>, <code>13925</code> next
to <b>Elastic track length</b>, <code>0 0 0</code> next to <b>Vehicle
center</b> and <b>Vehicle yaw,pitch,roll</b>. Disable the <b>Create
geometry file from frame</b> check button, so that the output file will
be an animation script. Finally press <b>OK</b> to create the file
<em>left.script</em>.
<p>
Pop up the show scripts window and press the <b>Restore</b> button to put
the tank back in its modeled position. Orient the display to a nice
35,25 view of the left track, and then press <b>Show</b> to show
left.script.
You should see
the left track moving around the left wheels, although the tank
itself doesn't
move. To get the full animation, you will need to combine the track
animation scripts with the vehicle animation script
(<em>tank.script</em> in this case).
<p>
It may appear to you that the left track stops and moves backwards
during the animation. There are two possible explanations for this
behavior. One is that the left track may need to turn backwards while
the right track is turning forward, if the tank's movement contains a a
very sharp left turn. The other possibility is that although the track
is actually moving forward, it appears to be rolling backward due to a
strobing effect. This is the same effect which causes wagon wheels to
appear to turn backwards in movies. When the track is moving slowly,
each pad moves slightly ahead of its previous position between frames.
However, if the track is moving faster, then each pad might move to just
behind the position that pad it follows was in during the previous
frame. Since the pads are identical, your eye thinks that the other pad
moved backward. Strobing problems can be avoided by selecting the
<b>Enable Anti-Strobing</b> checkbutton. When the track is moving
fast enough to cause strobing effects, this option adds random jitter
to the track movement, creating motion blur instead of strobing.
<p>
Before combining scripts, create an animation script for the right
track. Change the <b>Output file</b> to <code>right.script</code>,
and change the <b>Wheel specs from table</b> to <code>1</code>.
Change the wheel base name to <code>anim_wheels/rw.</code>,
change the pad base name to
<code>pads/rpad.</code>, and press <b>OK</b> to create
<em>right.script</em>.
<p>
From the main menu, select <b>COMBINE SCRIPTS</b> to pop up the
<a href="cscripts.gif">script-combining window</a>.
From the list of files on the right side of the window, select
<em>tank.script</em>, <em>left.script</em>, and <em>right.script</em>.
This should make those three names appear in the list on the left side.
Next to the <b>Create script</b> label, enter <code>all.script</code>,
then press <b>OK</b> to create <em>all.script</em>. When you show
<em>all.script</em>, the tank, pad,  and wheel animation should be combined in
such a way that the track appears to be driving the tank. In particular,
the pads which touch the ground should remain still as the tank rolls
over them.
<p>
The track animation window is built on top of the
<a href="./anim_track.html">anim_track</a> routine. This routine has
some additional features not accessible through AnimMate, such as the
ability to animate vehicles with dynamic suspensions.
