<HEAD><title>MGED commands: viewget, viewset</title></head>
<body>
<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>
viewget - get MGED view parameters
<p>
viewset - set MGED view parameters
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>
<b>viewget s(ize)|e(ye)|c(enter)|a(et)|y(pr)|q(uat)</b>
<p>
<b>viewset <var>type params ?type? ?params? ...</var></b>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<em>Viewget</em> returns the current value of the requested viewing parameters.
The following viewing parameters may be requested:
<dl>
<dt>size
<dd>The current viewsize.
<dt>eye
<dd>The current eye point, in the order <var>x y z</var>.
<dt>center
<dd>The current center point, in the order <var>x y z</var>. The center
point is always directly in front of the eye point. The distance
from the center to the eye is one half the viewsize.
<dt>aet
<dd>The azimuth, elevation, and twist of the current view. These angles
are defined as follows: an aet of <em>0 0 0</em> indicates that the view
faces the negative x direction, with the y-axis leading to the right and
the z-axis going up. To reach any other aet, the eye is rotated
+<var>twist</var>
degrees about the x-axis, -<var>elevation</var> degrees about the y-axis, and
<var>azimuth</var> degrees about the z-axis.
<dt>ypr
<dd>The yaw, pitch, and roll of the current view. These angles are
defined as follows: a ypr of <em>0 0 0</em> indicates that the view
faces the positive x direction, with the y-axis leading to the left and
the z-axis going up. To reach any other ypr, the eye is rotated
+<var>twist</var>
degrees about the x-axis, -<var>elevation</var> degrees about the y-axis,
and +<var>yaw</var>
degrees about the z-axis.
<dt><a name="quat">quat</a>
<dd>A unit quaternion representing the current view orientation, in the
order <var>x y z w</var>. The identity quaternion, <var>0 0 0 1</var>,
represents the orientation of the <kbd>press top</kbd> command:
facing the negative z direction with the x-axis to the right and the
y-axis going up. For any other unit quaternion, <var>x y z</var>
represents an axis of rotation, and <var>w</var> represents
cos(<var>theta</var> / 2), where <var>theta</var> is the angle the view is
rotated about the given axis. For example, the quaternion <var>0.707106
0.0 0.0 0.707106</var> represents the orientation achieved by the <kbd>press
right</kbd> button, since this orientation can be obtained from the
"top" orientation by rotating 90 degrees about the positive x-axis.
</dl>
<p>
<em>Viewset</em> sets the current viewing parameters. Any of the
parameter types returned by <em>viewget</em> can be set with
<em>viewset</em>. For example,
<p>
<kbd>mged> viewset ypr 35 25 0</kbd>
<p>
sets the yaw, pitch, and roll to <var>35 25 0</var>. More than one view
parameter may be specified at one time. If two view parameters conflict
with each other, then one of the parameters will be ignored. For
example, if <kbd>ypr</kbd> and <kbd>aet</kbd> are set in the same
command, one of the two is ignored. If neither <kbd>center</kbd> or
<kbd>eye</kbd> is specified, then the center point will remain fixed
while the eye point changes to accomadate a change in orientation or
viewsize.
<p>
If no orientation or viewsize parameter is set, then the orientation and
viewsize are normally unchanged.
The exception occurs when
<kbd>center</kbd> and <kbd>eye</kbd> are both specified in the same
<em>viewset</em> command. In that case,
the viewsize
and orientation are
calculated from the relationship between the center point and eye
point. Fixing the center and eye point still leaves an extra degree of
freedom; this ambiguity is resolved by selecting a "right-side up"
orientation (in terms of aet, an orientation with no twist).
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
The following command could be executed in an MGED interaction
window to obtain a typical top view:
<pre>
mged> viewset center 0 0 0 size 2000 quat 0 0 0 1
mged> viewget ypr
Warning: roll arbitrarily set to 0.0; yaw set to 1.570796 radians.
90 -90 0
</pre>
The warning message always occurs in relation to ypr and aet when the
pitch or elevation is an odd multiple of 90 degrees. In that case, the
yaw and roll become indistinguishable, and the arbitrary decision is
made to set the roll or twist to 0.0.
<p>
In order to change the view orientation without moving the eye point,
the following commands could be used:
<pre>
mged> viewget eye
0 0 1000
mged> viewset eye 0 0 1000 ypr 0 0 0
mged> viewget center
1000 0 1000
mged> viewget eye
0 0 1000
