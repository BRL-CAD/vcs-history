General Discussion about how to Make Animations using the BRL CAD Package

There are several distinct aspects to producing an animation:

1)  The creative insight.
2)  Specification of the geometry.
3)  Specification of the material properties, colors, textures.
4)  Specification of the model motion and articulation (choreography),
plus specification of the camera motion and lighting details (cinematography).
5)  Previewing the animation sequence using wireframe tools.
6)  Computation ("rendering") of the final sequence in very low resolution,
suitable for frame-buffer animation previews (see fbanim(1)).
7)  Computation ("rendering") of the final ray-traced images, storing them
in .pix files.
8)  Viewing selected frames, to review them for quality.
9)  Recording of the final images either on videotape or 16mm movie film.
