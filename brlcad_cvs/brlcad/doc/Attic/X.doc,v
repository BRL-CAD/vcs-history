@Per conversation with Lee, old file format specification documents
which can be better found on the Web have been removed from the
distribution.

@Support for the X Window System under Release 3.0 is included, but
is fairly primitive still.  Expect much better X support in a future
release.  Black and White Sun 3/50's were the only X servers we had
until very recently.  Problems with the X server under SGI's 4Sight,
and with the client code under Cray's UNICOS didn't help any either.

The current code only supports a 1-bit deep display (i.e. no color).
MGED is fairly complete, but the frame buffer library can't do pan
and zoom yet.  It has been run successfully however under a Sun 3/50
with X11R2, the Ardent and Stellar X servers, and SGI's 4Sight.

If you make any improvements to this code we would be very happy
to get them back.
