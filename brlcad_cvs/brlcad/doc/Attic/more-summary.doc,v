@                            BRL-CAD Update

BRL-CAD is a software package consisting of a solid modeling system, a
library of ray-tracing routines, two lighting models, many image
handling utilities and other useful graphics software.  This software
package is indispensible to the all classes of item-level modeling, as
the tools which it contains support the the generation, modification,
and interrogation of computer-aided design files (i.e. target
descriptions) fundamental to all vulnerability, neutron transport,
weight, signature, etc. calculations.

In October 1988, release 3.0 was made available and consists of
several updates and improvements.  The BRL-CAD package is in its third
generation and represents over 150,000 lines of C source code.
Designed to be highly portable, this software runs on hardware from a
variety of vendors offering the UNIX operating system.  To date, this
package has been sent to over 400 sites world-wide.  It is the major
CAD package supporting weapons analyses (predominantly vulnerability
and signature calculations) used by many entities of the DoD including
the Army, Air Force, various intelligence agencies, and various DoD
(including DARPA) contractors.


                       FASTGEN/MGED Integration

The Air Force uses the FASTGEN faceted geometric data format while the
Army uses the MGED hierarchical file format and interactive editor (of
the BRL-CAD system above).  In this task, the FASTGEN faceted geometry
was merged into the MGED system.  Due to the modular, object-oriented
design of the MGED system, it was a straight-forward task to merely
add the faceted geometry as a "new" primitive.  In addition, the
appropriate modules for the faceted geometry were added to the
associated ray-trace library (LIBRT), allowing utilization in all the
LIBRT application code.  This task has provided a single hybrid
geometric data base capable of supporting all applications and will
eliminate the current duplication of efforts since geometry generated
previously by hand in FASTGEN or via MGED (in BRL-CAD) can be merged
into a single, mixed data base and interrogated (via ray tracing)
through a single standard set of CAD tools to support both Army and
Air Force vulnerability codes.
