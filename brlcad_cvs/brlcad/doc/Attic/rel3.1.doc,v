Subject:  Re:  negative angle or positive

     This subject often generates considerable confusion when discussed via
email... things that could be explained in 5 seconds if people were talking
face to face with a toy tank as a conversation piece.

     Let me ask this question to try to clarify.  Given a model of a tank,
where X+ points from back to front, Z+ points up, and Y+ points left (i.e.,
Z+ is the cross product X+ x Y+), what would RT (or any other software) call
this view:

                                 ^  Z+

We in Vuln./Leth. call it 90 (or -270) degrees.  MGED does the same thing,
at least it always has.  Should I interpret your message to say that RT used
to be the lone wolf that behaved otherwise, but that it now agrees with
everybody else in the Universe in calling this 90 azimuth?  Does that also
mean that 90 elevation will look down on the top of the tank, and not up
at the bottom?

That only depends on how you map compass directions to coordinate axis.
If N is X and E it Y than toward E would be a negative Z rotation
(unless you use a left handed coordinate system or let your Z axis point
into the ground).  But I note that astronomers when dealing with azimuth
elevation usually use an SEZ (South, East, Zenith) coordinate system (where
X is S, Y is E).  This way Z goes "up" and toward E is a positive Z rotation
in a right handed system FROM THE SOUTH.  You may call it cheating, but hey,
whoever came up with "clockwise" got it backward [probably the combination
of reading from left to right and living in the northern hemisphere].

ps: In BRL-CAD software we *always* use Right Handed coordinates.

Actually, astronomers use "right ascension" and "declination".

Geophysicists often place the X axis eastward, Y northward, and Z down.

Mathematical convention (generally used by physicists) is for angles
to be taken as positive in the so-called "counterclockwise" direction
(whether it is counterclockwise or not depends on yet another
convention; think about it).

The bottom line seems to be that one should choose a consistent
nomenclature for the subject area then stick with it.

RT has changed in 3.0 to use the more common sign convention for azimuth
and elevation.  The interface to MGED never did pass azimuth and elevation
directly (it passed a viewing transformation matrix) so it did not have
to change.

RT differed from the rest-of-the-world not in what constituted a positive
azimuth and elevation, but rather in what was being rotated.  RT was
rotating the *model* according the the given values, while most people
think of positioning the *eye* (viewing or firing direction).  At my
urging RT was changed to be the same as everybody else.  So, the sign
inversion goes away in 3.0.

Subject:  Re:  videotaping from the iris

What we are presently using here for NTSC from an Iris is a Lyon-Lamb
ENC-VI NTSC Encoder (cost ~4500).  In my opinion, there are higher
quality encoders on the market (RGB Technologies, Faroudja CTE-N), but
this is one of the cheapest (and includes a Sync generator and Black/
ColorBars generator).  In software, you need to set the Iris for 30Hz
interlaced (which means that the main monitor becomes useless until
you go back to 60Hz).  You get the lower left hand corner of the screen
(~640x480 pixels).

If you want the full IRIS screen to come out in NTSC you will need a
"frame scan converter".  These are more expensive (~25k).  See e.g.
Photron.

SGI also sells an RGB -> NTSC encoder board for the 4Ds.  We bought
one but sadly have not been able to use it.  Why is because the SGI
board outputs a fully positive video signal (i.e. blanking is around
+0.3V) rather than a bipolar signal with blanking at 0VDC.  While
I haven't found anything in the RS170A spec that requires an absolute
voltage level (it all looks to be AC coupled), much to my surprise our
Sony BVU850 seems to REQUIRE blanking to be at 0VDC (or at the very
least average picture level to be at 0VDC).  Black levels get all
messed up when recorded from the SGI board but come out okay from the
ENC-VI.  I don't know who's to "blame", if anyone, but its something
to keep in mind.  [nothing works the way it is supposed to]

Subject:  Rel 3.0/SGI 3D 3.5 bug fix

On the BRL-CAD Release 3.0 tapes, there are three modules that need to
be fixed for proper operation on an SGI 3-D series workstation with
SGI Release 3.5.  To be safe, these modules should also be modified for
use on SGI Release 3.6 and beyond.

I regret that these problems were not discovered earlier.  My thanks to
Lee Butler of NASA Space Telescope and Sue Muuss of BRL/VLD/ASB who
encountered these difficulties within hours of each other, and provided
detailed bug reports.

The three modules that need to be fixed are:
	mged/dm-ir.c	Add missing curley brackets
	mged/rtif.c	Fix problem with pointer changing
	rt/worker.c	Work-around SGI C Compiler problem

Subject:  Re:  XMP rt died again

I tried a small experiment on Patton.  Their asin() function in -lm
reports "BAD SCALAR ARGUMENT" only when it really is a domain error
(so far as I was able to determine).  Note that one of Gwyn's rules
of reliable numerical programming is never to use any inverse trig
function other than atan2().  There have been times when I've been
tempted to remove asin(), acos(), and especially atan() from the
standard library to enforce this rule (but of course I haven't done
so).

Almost certainly you're feeding 1.000...000x or -1.000...000x to
asin() (where "x" stands for some nonzero digits).  The nearly-but-
not-quite 1.0 value normally results from floating-point imprecision
when angles near some integral multiple of 90 degrees are involved.
Unfortunately, this is more the rule than the exception in computer
graphics.  You need to use a more robust algorithm.

(.39R + .5G + .11B) is apparently incorrect.  This set could be a
typographical error (from .29R + .6G + .11B ?), a liberal approximation,
or perhaps an unusual phosphor set.  Could someone enlighten me on this?

In followup article <8811042303.AA21505@@dawn.steinmetz.GE.COM>, Dick
St.Peters <stpeters@@dawn.UUCP> makes the statement:

Equal weighting of the primaries is NOT the right thing to do, unless the
viewers of your images are members of some species that has uniform
response across the visible spectrum, unlike homo sapiens.

Humans see 1 watt of green light energy as being somewhat brighter than 1
watt of red, and very much brighter than 1 watt of blue.  The science of
colourimetry began to flourish in 1931, when the CIE standardized a
statistical entity called the "standard observer".  This includes a
standard spectral luminance response defined numerically as a function of
wavelength.  It is from this data that the factors which are used in
colour television are derived:  .587 for green, .299 for red, and 
.114 for blue.

The particular factors depend on the wavelengths or chromaticities
that you call red, green, and blue:  there is wide disparity in these
choices.  For computer graphics and television, the luminance factors
depend on the chromaticity coordinates of the phosphors of your CRT.
There are compromises in the choice of phosphor primaries, but it turns
out that the NTSC did a spectacularly good job of selecting primaries.
The luminance coefficients 0.299 for red, 0.114 for blue, and 0.587 for
green are unquestionably the best values to use, unless you know your
phoshphors intimately.

The second article continues, 
> 						The formula is from

Contrary to this assertion, the ONLY compromise in NTSC which impacts the
luminance equation is the choice of reference phosphor chromaticities, and
a choice of phosphors MUST be made for any system which transmits colour
in RGB.  Just because it's old (1954) doesn't mean we should throw it
away.

Aside from this, the discussion of television coding which follows is
substantially correct, except that modulation onto an RF carrier for
transmission involves no inherent compromises beyond those already made in
formation of baseband NTSC.  (Receivers frequently make their own
compromises, but these are not inherent.)

For those interested, I attach an alternate description of television
coding.

GAMMA CORRECTION

A picture tube (CRT) produces a light output which is proportional to its
input voltage raised to approximately the 2.5-th power.  Rather than
requiring circuitry to implement the 2.5-th root function to compensate
for this be implemented at every receiver, the "gamma correction" is
performed on the R, G, and B primaries at the camera to form signals
denoted R', G', and B'.

YUV REPRESENTATION (3 wires)

Studio equipment typically processes colour signals in three components
YUV, which are easily derived from RGB.  The Y channel contains the
luminance (black-and-white) content of the image, and is computed as:   

	Y' = 0.299 R' + 0.587 G' + 0.114 B'  

"Colour difference" signals U and V are scaled versions of B'-Y' and R'-Y'
respectively; these vanish for monochrome (grey) signals.   The human
visual system has much less acuity for spatial variation of colour than
for luminance, and the advantage of U and V components is that each can be
conveyed with substantially less bandwidth than luminance, R or G or B.
In analog YUV studio systems, U and V each have a bandwidth of 1.5 MHz,
compared to between 4.2 MHz and 5.5 MHz for luminance.  In digital
systems, U and V are each horizontally subsampled by a factor of two (i.e.
conveyed at half the rate of the luminance signal).

Y/C REPRESENTATION (2 wires)

U and V can be combined easily into a "chroma" signal which is conveyed as
modulation of a continuous 3.58 MHz sine-wave subcarrier.  Subcarrier
phase is decoded with reference to a sample or "burst" of the 3.58 MHz
continuous-wave subcarrier which is transmitted during the horizontal
blanking interval.  The phase of the chroma signal conveys a quantity
related to hue, and its amplitude conveys a quantity related to colour
saturation (purity).  The "S" connectors of S-VHS and ED-Beta equipment
simply carry Y and C on separate wires.  This coding is easily decoded
without artifacts.  Current S-VHS equipment conveys chroma with severely
limited bandwidth, about 300 kHz (which is just 16 cycles of U or V per
picture width).   Consumer VCR equipment has always recorded the luminance
and chroma components separately on tape, but only since the introduction
of the S-connector in S-VHS and ED-Beta equipment has the consumer been
able to take advantage of this capability.

NTSC REPRESENTATION (1 wire)

The NTSC system mixes Y and C together and conveys the result on one piece
of wire.  The result of this addition operation is not theoretically
reversible:  the process of separating luminance and colour often confuses
one for the other.  Cross-colour artifacts result from luminance patterns
which happen to generate signals near the 3.58 MHz colour subcarrier.
Such information may be decoded as swirling colour rainbows.
Cross-luminance artifacts result if modulated colour information is
incorrectly decoded as crawling or hanging luminance dots.  It is these
artifacts which can be avoided by using the S-connector interface.  In
general, once the NTSC footprint is impressed on a signal, it persists
even if subsequent processing is performed in RGB or YUV components.

Encoded NTSC signals can be sampled into a stream of 8-bit bytes.  Such
"composite digital" systems have the advantage of using slightly less
memory than component systems, at the expense of the dreaded NTSC
artifacts.  Manipulation of such composite signals to perform operations
such as shrinking the picture is difficult or impossible, because if the
colour subcarrier frequency is altered the colour information in the
signal is destroyed.  Therefore, these operations are performed in the
component domain.

FREQUENCY INTERLEAVING

The NTSC colour subcarrier frequency is chosen to be exactly 455/2 times
the line rate of 9/.572 kHz.  The fact that the subcarrier frequency is an
odd multiple of half the line rate causes colour information to be
interleaved with the luminance spectrum:  if a portion of a coloured
region has a positive-going modulated chroma component on one scan line,
then on the next line chroma will go negative.  This property allows the
use of a "comb filter" to separate luminance and chroma.  The signal is
delayed by one total line time, in order that two vertically adjacent
picture elements be available to the electronics at the same instant in
time.  Forming the sum of these two elements will produces luminance, and
forming their difference produces the modulated chroma.  This feature
results in greatly improved luma/chroma separation compared to a 3.58 MHz
"trap" filter.  However, a comb filter assumes a fair degree of vertical
correlation in the picture, and this assumption does not hold for pictures
with great vertical detail.

Dan,
	Due to subtle changes in the behavior of the graphics library on

commands via the console keyboard on the IRIS *when* mouse interaction
is selected.  It was simply not worth supporting this when keyboard input
is available by selecting the curses popup menus instead, and then quitting
the menu system to get the keyboard prompt.

	On IRIX 4D-3.1, the adoption of the NeWS system for windowing has
added more confusion since 'lgt' does not know how to detect for the
presence of or startup the 4Sight graphics system (I only installed the
4Sight software on my 4D last week).  Possibly the next release of 'lgt'
will support the PostScript menus, but not unless I get time away from other
projects.

	I would recommend using the curses-style menus over the SGI ones;
they don't have the problem of missing the desired entry with the mouse,
they have help built in (by typing 'h'), and they remember what the last
selection was for a given menu or sub-menu.

RS-170 video can be capacitively coupled (and often is at the input
of a piece of equipment).  If the equipment depends on blanking being at
a specific DC level, it will have a "DC restorer" circuit that clamps
a reference part of the signal to ground - usually the blanking level
found in the "back porch" after the sync pulse, though the tip
of the sync pulse could conceivably be used too.

If your Sony lacks input coupling capacitors, its DC restorer may be
fighting the SGI board output - capacitively coupling the signal should
fix this.  If the Sony simply lacks its own DC restorer and really does
depend on the absolute voltage levels in its input (unlikely), then
just pass the signal through a video distribution amplifier which does
DC restoration (these are readily available).

If the Sony has its own DC restoration and a capacitively coupled input,
then there has to be something "out-of-spec" in the video signal that you
are feeding it that causes it to be confused - incorrect sync or video
amplitude, incorrect sync pulse width, or the like.

I'd like to suggest that (.39R + .5G + .11B) is not a good choice for
"intensity" in the realm of computer graphics.  The formula is from
the (1954) NTSC standard for compatible color TV, and it has built
into it a lot of compromises to accommodate old technology and
problems inherent in the analog transmission of composite color
television.

A better choice in computer graphics is to equally weight the colors:
((R+G+B)/3.0).  Let white be white.

For those interested:

Because color space is three dimensional (example coordinates: RGB),
composite TV must use three different forms of modulation to transmit
three independent information streams on a single carrier.  This is
not even possible in general.

However, there were clever engineers even back then.  Because each TV
scanline differs little from its predecessor, the TV signal is roughly
periodic, which in turn means its spectrum is as well.  A periodic
spectrum is a series of spikes, so before color, the spectrum of a TV
signal when looked at in detail looked like a picket fence.

It is possible to modulate a signal to carry TWO independent streams
of information, using quadrature modulation, so the color guys used
the two chrominance signals to modulate a low-frequency signal and
then used that entire modulated signal to modulate the basic TV
carrier in a way so that the chrominance pickets were in the gaps
between the luminance pickets.  Voila, 3 signals on one TV carrier.

Well, sort of.  The pickets have tails and can get pretty wide if the
scene changes rapidly, so there is always some crosstalk and sometimes
a lot of it.  Things get even hairier when you modulate this onto RF.

Further, not all 3 signals were created equal.  The original signal
is what a B&W TV sees, and it still had to look like a B&W TV signal,
so this "luminance" signal had to be some combination of RGB that was
roughly the "intensity", while what was left over had to be divied up
into two "chrominance" signals.  Various constraints make the
bandwidth for the luminance signal substantially more than the *sum*
of the bandwidths for the two chrominance signals - and the latter
differ by roughly a factor of two.  Just from an information content
point of view, it matters what RGB combinations are used.  NTSC took
all this into account, as well as human eye characteristics.

But they had more to consider.  A B&W TV demodulates the luminance and
uses the resulting signal to control a CRT gun.  However, the CRT
brightness is not linear relative to the luminance signal - in fact,
it is roughly proportional to the *square* of the signal.  Applying
the principle that receivers had to be cheap but transmitters could be
expensive, B&W television applied a correction for this at the
transmitter.  Color TV had to be compatible both ways - not to mention
a need to be inexpensive, so color TV's as well responded to the
square (more or less) of the luminance, and color transmitters had to
apply the same correction ("gamma" correction).

In other words, after the transmitting end divides RGB up into nice
linear combinations, it applies a non-linear transformation.  The
receiver then demodulates the resulting signals, uses linear
recombination to reconstruct "RGB", and applies them to a CRT that
squares them.

The NTSC had to find RGB combinations for luminance and chrominance
that let B&W sets receive color transmissions, color sets receive B&W
transmissions, and color sets receive color transmissions, all within
the limits of 1954 technology and the constraints of analog RF TV.
(We didn't even get to the RF issues.)  They did a marvelous job, but
their formula for intensity is a severe compromise.

  Iris 3000s are shipped with two video options.   The two defaults
  provide video timings for 1280 by 1024 60hz monitors and 640 by 480
  RS170/NTSC monitors.    A customer can request that the RS170
  option be replaced with either PAL/SECAM timings or for a 1280 by
  1024 interlaced 30hz monitor.

  All Iris 4D systems ship with all four of the above timing options.

  When in RS170 mode, the Iris outputs the three components of RGB
  in the correct RS170 timings, un-encoded.   The bottom leftmost rectangle
  of 640 by 480 pixels is displayed on the full RS170 monitor screen.

  An option board may be purchased from Silicon Graphics for Iris 4D 
  systems which takes the three RGB outputs and color encodes them
  into a composite video signal.   This signal is appropriate for
  connecting directly to any television, or to a VCR.   The composite
  video output does not match up to broadcast quality; there is some
  minor difference that I am not familiar with.   This should only be
  a concern for the media organizations, not for those of us creating video
  presentations.   (Otherwise one buys a much more expensive broadcast
  quality color encoder.)

  This option board is called (internally, at least) the CG2/3.  It
  also provides the genlocking capability.   This is the capability to
  sync up and overlay the video from two separate systems (while in
  either high res 60hz or NTSC modes).

  So option one for video taping on an Iris 4D is to buy a CG2/3.  
  The bottom left quarter of the screen may be recorded directly into
  any recording device that accepts NTSC composite video.

  Option two allows you to video tape the full picture on your 1280 by 
  1024 high resolution display.   Pixel averaging is done to reduce
  4 pixels down to one giving the appropriate number of pixels (640 - 480)
  for NTSC.   Pixel averaging provides better images over simply drawing
  the image into the bottom leftmost portion of your screen because a
  certain amount of anti-aliasing takes place in the pixel averaging.
  It also allows full screen video taping.   Option two is available
  from vendors like RGB Technologies (don't know their pricing).  The output
  from these systems is, again, standard composite video.    Note:
  Silicon Graphics has some ongoing development that should help
  those desiring the pixel averaged approach.

Lee,

To answer each of your remarks:

This happens when you do an accept edit from an object illuminate while
there is an EVALUATED object being displayed.  For reasons not entirely
clear to me, MGED is unable to redraw the edited object if it had already
been "evaluated", i.e. you need to re-evaluate it if desired after editing.
Ordinarily one illuminates "e'd" objects, not "E'd" ones.  I agree though
that it should be possible to make MGED re-evaluate for you however.

>	mged> SunPw_object: nvec 1344 clipped to 1024

Oops.  The clipping wasn't quite right.  In mged/dm-sun.c the change:

		if( numvec++ > 1024 ) {		OLD
		if( ++numvec > 1024 ) {		NEW

fixes that.

> Can you really subtract one region from another? (problem creating

I just tried this out.  It appears that MGED still has problems with
regions within regions.  RT however does evaluate such subtractions
correctly (I checked).  MGED needs to be "modernized" here.

The discussion of luminance computations and the subsequent discussion
of the meaning of white reminds me of an experience I had a few years ago
when Pixar was a division of Lucasfilm and we were working on an effect
for "Young Sherlock Holmes".  Aesthetic decisions were being made by
people sitting in front of color monitors.  The digital images were
transferred to film using three color lasers.  The film was printed and
then projected in a screening room.  I decided that this was an great
place to implement a what-you-see-is-what-you-get color system.  And
so I delved into the murky depths of colorimetry in the hope of
developing a color-correction program that would produce
the same color in the screening room that was measured on the color
monitors.  This a difficult problem (in fact, in its strictest sense, an
impossible one, since the color gamuts of the two systems have mutually
exclusive regions).  I took into account the CIE coordinates of the
monitor's phosphors, its color balance, the sensitivity of the color film
to each of the lasers, cross-talk between the film layers, effects of
film processing, the spectral characteristics of the print film's dye
layers, and the spectral characteristics of a standard projector
bulb.  Several steps in this process are extremely non-linear, but I
was able to achieve some good results by using some piece-wise linear
approximations.  I felt a great sense of success when I used a colormeter
to confirm that the CIE coordinates on the silver screen did, indeed,
closely match those on the tiny screen.  We color corrected a few shots
and showed them to the effects director.  He's response was, "Why does
this look so blue"?  It turns out that when we look at a TV we're accustomed
to a blue balance and when we're sitting in a theater we expect a yellow
balance.  The digital color correction was abandoned and the production
relied on the film lab to produce an aesthetic balance.  Thus proving
to me that science may work, but computer graphics and film making are
still largely a matter of art.

5.3 New Drawing Subroutines

Software reliease 4D1-3.0 introduced several new Graphics Library
subroutines for drawing and pixel access.  Silicon Graphics recommends
converting old style routines to the new ones for three reasons:

    * Your code will be more portable.

    * On the GT and future products, the new subroutines will run up
      to 10 times faster than their old counterparts.

    * The new subroutines simplify the Graphics Library and allow for
      future expansion.

In most cases, the convertion is simple -- just substitute the new
subroutines for the old ones.  Unfortunately, the new subroutines do
not work in display lists, so if your code is based primarily on
display lists, the solution is not so simple.

This table gives a comparison of old and new subroutines.

Interestingly, the 10x factor seems to be correct as one of our
customers reported that our product "ran ten times slower" on the GT.

We happily followed the SGI guide to speed them up.  At one point we
changed all our readpixel() calls to rectread() calls, a non-trivial
task because they don't have the same arguments at all.  To our great
surprise, the following was printed when the new call was made:

	<rectread> is not implemented.

We were impressed at just how fast their new function didn't work, as
I'm sure you can guess.

Curious, we investigated.  Making use of "strings", we found that
libgl_s.a contained the string "<%s> is not implemented.".  Just how
many functions might call whatever routine has that string is
something that scares me.

Subject:  BRLCAD 3.0 MGED: bug report

Phil,
	I figure you probably are more familiar with the Sun driver
for mged than most, so here goes; sorry if the details are a little
vague, but in retrospect, I didn't ask enough questions:

Randy Smith of MSIC reports that on his Sun 3 (color) running 3.x
that he gets a segmentation violation when he trys to display
something.  He had reported this problem about a month ago, but I
told him to wait for BRLCAD 3.0 and try it again and he says it's
still there.  DBX indicates a bad pointer in the PIX_COLOR call
(I'm pretty sure it's the one on line 394 of dm-sun.c):

	if( sun_depth < 8 ) {
		sun_color( DM_WHITE );
		color = PIX_COLOR(sun_cmap_color);
        } else {
		color = PIX_COLOR(mp->mt_dm_int); <----- culprit
	}
                         
The rest of his problems occur only on a Sun 4 with SunOS 4.0, with
*no* graphics processor:

	When editing a large group of objects, mged seems to hang
forever; no display comes up.  This is with plenty of memory (32 Megs);
the same group works on his Sun 3 with 4 Megs.

	When attaching the display, the menu comes up in black and
white with no lettering in the boxes.  The graphics display has color
initially.  Then, if he resizes the window, the text gets filled in
the menu, but the graphics goes to black and white.

	Using the 'rt' command from 'mged' the image is scrambled in
some random fashion, though it seems to fill the window; the 'rt' program
works fine from the shell.

Randy is very pleased with the improvements to the Sun driver, i.e.
window resizing capability, object illuminate, function buttons, etc.
He intends to try and track these bugs down with DBX, but he is having
trouble with DBX on SunOS 4.0 and will be calling his Sun rep about it.
I told him that I don't know if we will have access to 4.0 to reproduce
these problems, but agreed to pass it on for the record.  He is confident
that with the improvements to dm-sun.c in 3.0, our user base will grow
considerably on the Suns (not that I gave him any reason to think that
we would be pleased by such a development).

a bit faster by some optimization, and it helpped, but not much.
It seems that there may be some swapbuffers or video interlace
limitation on the number of operations/second that can be done.

This would be worth looking at, as the maximum speed of pixels
display on the 4D is certainly a lot less than it should be.
Something for our lists.

Subject: Graphics from multiple threads
To: info-iris@@BRL.MIL

Mike Muuss reported some problems with the 4D/20 and the 4D GTX.  I can
address the problem with multiple threads on the MP machine.

There is a limitation (imposed by software) that only the original parent can
access the graphics pipe.  The SGI demos available ARE multi-threaded, but
only a single process performs graphics.  Fixing this limitation is one of
our highest priorities for the next major release.  Currently, this release
is tagged as 4.0, and is scheduled for around October 1989.

For a brief description of what is happening:  The graphics pipe is mapped
into the user program's address space.  When the program fork()s for sproc()s,
this pipe is unmapped.  Thus when a child process attempts a graphics call
that accesses the pipe, it will dump core with a segmentation fault.  I noticed
that this behavior is not documented in either the fork(2) or sproc(2) man
pages -- I will remedy this.

The reason that the graphics pipe is unmapped across a fork/sproc is that
a great deal of software relies upon the fact that a pipe context corresponds
to a single process.  We felt that we could not change this in time for the
3.1 release.

As you read this, this limitation is being remedied.  Currently, we are planning
to introduce a new "share bit" to sproc (PR_SGRAPH) that indicates that the
threads would like to share graphics.  If this bit is on, the graphics
pipe context will be inherited across the sproc().  The user program will
be responsible for ensuring mutual exclusion of pipe accesses.

Subject:  Bug Report on 3.0

Here are three problems that I have found with Release 3.0 running on
an SGI 4D running OS 2.3:

1) In mged, it is possible to object edit an object containing cylinders,
push the (rotation) transformations, and end up with cylinders that appear
correct. However, when trying to raytrace, the base vectors 'a' and 'b' of
the cylinders end up not being perpendicular. Also, radius vectors can
be off by a small amount (I think in the area of thousandths of an inch).
Raytracing does not work, and the cylinders have to be re-entered so that
it will.

2) The ARS does not raytrace correctly (I reported before that it did and
just complained a lot, but I was thinking of the last CAD release). The
output is black (0,0,0) or sometimes *very* dark. I don't know what surface
normals would be output, but at least the thickness is correct when raytraced
with rtshot. I need this for a current government contract (within two 
months?).

3) Running LGT with pop-up menus, no keyboard input is accepted unless
prompted for as the result of a pop-up menu selection. (Running without 
pop-up menus in favor of the curses style menus gives correct behavior.)

Subject:  CAD 3.0: on SunOS 4.0 on 4/280 (good news and bad)

Phil,
	Got a call from Randy L. Smith of MSIC today.  He is very pleased
with the fixes for the Sun OS4 that I sent him after your note about the
mged/SunOS4.0.diffs file.  He also said that your suggestion for fixing
the material properties pointer (mp) problem, by testing it for MATER_NULL
first, worked well.  Could you install that fix (I have a copy of it if
you need it)?

	Now for some more bugs:

	1)  When attempting to draw dashed lines (subtracted prims) the
system hangs (consuming 100% cpu).  Randy has reason to believe that the
error lies in the specification of 'texP' in routine dm-sun.c:'sun_get_texP';
'texP' gets passwd to 'pw_polyline'.  Apparently the program is hanging up
in 'pr_texvec' which is directly or indirectly called by 'pw_polyline'.
Perhaps the initialization of 'dotdashed' in 'sun_get_texP' is non-portable
to Sun OS 4.0.

	2)  If you resize the graphics window in MGED, the color map gets
messed up (all vectors turn white, or green depending on the system).  Moving
the window works fine.

	All of this is on Sun 4/2[68]0 running OS 4.0.  Randy understands
that this may not receive prompt attention and will notify us if he runs
across a fix.

Subject:  Re:  How to model coil spring

I whole-heartedly support the proposal of adding the general extruded solid.
For example such a primitive could be defined by translating an area
(determined by a closed, non-intersecting, planar curve) along a 3-D curve
in either of two modes: 1) the planar area is always normal to the tangent
of the 3-D curve; or 2) the planar area always keeps the same orientation
as at the starting position, but would not be allowed if the the tangent
vector of the 3-D curve were ever coplanar with the closed curve within
the region of interest the 3-D curve passes through.

As well, I hope you will consider a another primitive found in many
CAD systems: a solid of revolution defined by revolving the area
determined by a non-self-intersecting planar curve about a specified
axis (which must be in the same plane) through a given fraction of full
rotation (0 < F <= 1) counterclockwise when viewed from the positive
direction.  The planar curve may touch the axis, but not cross it.

With the addition of these two primitives (and for the extruded solid
only the less general case ["mode 2"]  would be needed--but
no smooth coil spring capability....), BRLCAD could support the
IGES CSG solid modeling specification.

A piece of information:  The IGES CSG specification is contained in
the proposed new ANSI standard for grapics exchange slated for formal
acceptance within the next 6 - 9 months.  Some CAD vendors have already
implemented the translators for the IGES CSG specification.  Hence
if BRLCAD had the two translators (in/out), import/export of CSG models
from/to other CAD systems could be made with minimum effort (i.e.,
no need to write a separate conversion program for all CSG models having
different parameters formats than BRLCAD but available in IGES format).
I would think that libwdb would help make the translator development rather
straightforward.

						-Earl


P.S. An obvious benefit of BRLCAD supporting the soon-to-be ANSI CSG
exchange spec would mean that we would be in a position to accept IGES
CSG models from US defense contractors... and not have to do most of
the major modeling work for some analyses...  Under the DoD CALS
program, defense contractors will have to start supplying data in
ANSI format for new defense systems...

Subject:  Re:  How to model coil spring

Earl,

Much of the work for adding Prisms (perpendicular extrusion of a
curve) to BRL-CAD has already been done.  Volumes of revolution
is the next most likely primitive to follow.  Generalized prisms,
where the boundary curve follows the Frenet frame along an arbitrary
path (your case 1), will take quite a bit of work, so I wouldn't
expect to see them soon.

As for IGES import/export:  This would be sort of nice, but I don't
think anyone here has it on their "to do" list.  When I examined
interchange formats a year or so ago, my feeling was to skip IGES
and wait for ISO STEP.  [You may think that this is a big mistake,
with ANSI being behind IGES CSG and all, but I think we can use
lessons like GOSIP in the network protocol world to show that the
U.S. government isn't likely to stop shooting itself in the foot
(and thus in the future go the ISO route).]

Subject:  Re:  How to model coil spring

Phil,

Perhaps from a position of principle one can hope that the ISO STEP
solution would be the clearer choice (and one that I'm not opposed
to), but there are some practicalities that need to be considered.

I don't want to spend a lot of time and LOTS of words here describing
the relationships among ANSI, IGES, STEP (and more properly called
PDES/STEP in the U.S.), but I think I should share a few short words 
with those who have an interest in this subject.

ANSI is a national standards group whose work is generally accepted
in the U.S. (ANSI is the American National Standards Institute) as
"standard" (whether good or bad and if bad, the result will be that
users will stop using it).   It has no affiliation with the U.S.
Govt. that I know of.  ISO is the international counterpart.

IGES (the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification--somewhat a misnomer
because the current work is no longer "initial") is an industry/govt
consortium whose initial participants were primarily GE and Boeing and
whose goal was to facilitate exchange of "electronic drawings" produced
by dissimilar CAD (here the D means drafting) systems some ten years or
so ago  (I'll get some flak, here, from IGES old timers who contend that
their original intents were not limited to engineering drawings...).
Needless to say, the IGES work has exploded to cover lots of
areas (all graphics oriented) and although not perfect (what is?) has
been accepted by most of the US industry and govt.  Indeed the Navy
requires IGES  utilization in some of the BIG Navy contracts (Seawolf,
etc.).  Many hundreds of "volunteers" from hundreds of companies and
some govt agencies do the IGES work which is "managed" by NIST (formally
NBS)

Four or five years ago, the French developed their answer (rebuttal?)
to IGES called SET and found acceptance at Aerospatiale and maybe
a few other european outfits, but the U.S. found drawbacks in it, too.
But that work spawned interest in ISO to develop an internationally
recognized standard.

Then several years ago, a small group within IGES developed a concept
that is based upon a common "database" that could be used throughout
the life cycle of a part (or whole system...) from concept to retirement.
That concept is PDES (Product Data Exchange Specification) and is "aimed
at communicating a complete model with sufficient information content
as to be interpretable directly by advanced CAD/CAM applications..."


ISO STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Data), "a neutral
exchange medium [sic] capable of completely representing product
definition data," became an international project and the ISO
organization looked primarily to the U.S. for guidance and expertise.

PDES and STEP, in the U.S. are converging to the same thing insomuch
as they are commonly called "PDES/STEP."  However, the real use
of PDES/STEP will not be seen for some time yet.  PDES has great
interest to the Air Force and the AF would like to see PDES utilized
in the ATF (advanced tactical fighter) project, but...  

OK, now to the practicalities...  Currently the major use of IGES is
still in the "electronic drawing" area and has wide acceptance within
the U.S.  Since the CSG portion of the solid modeling spec has been
around for three or four years, some vendors have implemented the
translators for that already.  And some contractors are now doing
solid modeling to support engineering work using their commercial
CAD/CAM systems.  Thus IGES has a pretty broad base in the U.S.
So for the near future (1, 2, 3... yrs?) we can expect that any
CAD/CAM data available to us from contractors will be either in
IGES format or in the native format of the contractors' CAD systems.
Simple arithmetic will show that if available, an IGES file will
require much less work to convert than a native format file,
especially if there are lots of different CAD systems involved.

The bottom line is that I predict that ISO STEP (or PDES) models 
useful to us won't be available from U.S. defense contractors until 
AT LEAST five years and we'd best put our money, at this stage, 
into IGES.  And some (if not most) of the tools we'd develop for 
IGES should be usable for developing ISO STEP translators

Peter,

I applaud your eagerness to do it correctly from the beginning!  However,
you'd best pick less than two people to arrive at a concensus on this
subject within two years.  [I base this on many years of work involving
volunteers of "workers" on many subjects including graphics 'standards'.]

I suggest you contact Kalman Brauner (if you don't know him) at Boeing
(206 251-2222 [assuming he still has the same #]) and discuss your ideas
with him.  Same for Phil Kennicott at General Electric (518 387-6231),
Jeff Altemueller at McDonnel Douglas (314 234-5272), Brad Smith at NIST
(301 975-3559).  These people, if they're on the ball, should welcome
your assistance.

Meanwhile, I re-emphasize my statement of our need here at the BRL for
the capability to exploit the current base of IGES-available product
definition data and that which would be available for the near future
until a better mousetrap comes along.  To me the situation is analogous
to waiting for the perfect dental solution that prevents all tooth/gum
problems rather then submitting to the current picks and drill.  I'm 
not suggesting that the other outfits on this list have the same need.

John Anderson, here, submits that by the time ISO STEP is developed,
validated, and accepted by the masses, a new, better (perhaps your
proposal) methodology will come to light, and then should we wait
for that, too, rather than implement ISO STEP?

And finally, let me make it absolutely clear that I am NOT opposed to 
the new approaches in the works (PDES/STEP, or whatever), but I think
the benefits, to BRL, in using IGES exceed the cost of developing at
least the "import" (to BRLCAD) CSG translator.

The citation previously posted does *not* treat the shearing approach but
instead focusses on 2-pass separable forms (Smith reprises the 2-pass methods
in SIGGRAPH '87 pp. 263-272). The work has direct application in image warping.

3-pass rotation using shear matrices appears in:

    ``A Fast Algorithm for General Raster Rotation''
    Paeth, A. W.
    Proceedings, Graphics Interface '86,
    Canadian Information Processing Society,
    Vancouver, pp 77-81.
    
Shearing (i.e. no image stretching or scaling) yields a very efficient inner-
loop despite the extra pass, but leaves the technique rotation-specific.
It also allows for 90-degree rotation (which 2-pass techniques do not): here
it generalizes the 90deg 3-pass shuffle used by the Blit terminal and elsewhere
(eg: Kornfeld, C. ``The Image Prism: A Device for Rotating and Mirroring
Bitmap Images'' IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 7(5) pp 25.).

The scale invariance during rotation can be used nicely in making circle or
polygon generaters that are provably correct. The matrix forms in the paper
shed light on how and why the following oft-cited bit of CS lore works:

    /* Find next CW point along circle perimeter, start with [X,Y] = [1,0] */

    X' =      X  + eps*Y;

    Y' = -eps*X'+      Y;  /* carry down __X'__, not X for best results! */
    
As proposed by Newman and Sproull (vol I only), ascribed to I.E. Sutherland,
and mentioned recently in Jim Blinn's Corner (Algorithm 6 in ``How Many Ways
Can You Draw A Circle, IEEE CG&A, August, 1987). Adding a third line:

    X'' =     X' + eps*Y'; /* carry down some more! */
    
corresponding to the third shearing pass (plus some one-time-only trig to find
eps in statement two, because eps[1]=eps[3]<>eps[2]) now gives rise to a circle
drawer in which "eps" can be large enough to draw closed n-gons with impunity.

Incidentally, the earliest reference I find to three-pass shear matrix
techniques goes to C. F. Gauss. His application was, ironically: Ray Tracing!
(Three shear passes occur for each refraction-transfer-refraction of a ray
through a lens. See Blaker, J. W., __Geometric Optics -- The Matrix Theory__,
Marcel Dekker, (New York) 1971).

I have previously posted the fuctional source appearing in the raster rotation
paper; I'm happy to mail interested parties (or post given sufficient interest)
a TeX document which refines the above circle-generator discussion along the
lines of Blinn's CG&A article.

You are going to have a challange here.  Usually, a controller chip

I would suggest going with atleast 16-bit wide downloads to the shift

RJ> In addition I need to find out a few facts about monitors.  Is a 60 Hz.

I think that once a monitor is set at 30 Hz or 60 Hz, your stuck.
What can be changed is the way you feed the monitor.   You can opt
to feed it ONE image every frame, or two interlaced images every
two frames. 

RJ> Can you up the pixel clock and feed more pixels per scan line?  Does all

If you have a fancy controller, I don't see why not, but the pain may not

( i.e., feed it all the pixels you want ( see beam size comment ) ).  The
critical thing is that you observe the fact that the scan line will only
be active for a certain fixed amount of time, and that you have certain
sync parameters to consider.  I don't know hpow multi-sync monitors

Usually, the whole timing mess grinds down to finding your base clock
rate so that all the above timing figures work out as integer multiples
of it ( e.g., vert. front porch is equal to 3 scan lines ).  Then whatever
resolution works out is what you get.  Usually, I find that you get some
specs such as above, work forward to find the resulting resolution, gripe
that its too weird ( 1258 X 1013 ), work backwards and change some of your
initial parameters, making sure to stay within the specs, etc.....

Good luck !!

Peter,

It looks like we're in agreement on philosophical principles.  But on the 
practical side of the issue, we may still have differences of opinion.

Remember that my original msg to Mike stated the benefit to BRL of using IGES.
When Phil responded [and essentially compared IGES to STEP] I offered a very
short discussion on the history and relationships among IGES, STEP, ANSI, etc.,
and emphasized the usefulness of IGES to BRL here and now.

You responded by agreeing with Phil that waiting until ISO STEP was the
better choice ("I agree with Earl: [BRL using IGES is] practical and 
justifiable - but still a waste of resources"), but then proposed the
development and implementation of better mousetrap (by reaching a consensus
among knowledgeable participants within a two-year period).

I answered by clarifying my position and again restating the reason why BRL
would benefit here and now with IGES [V 4.0].

All along my point has been that IGES has not only been accepted by many US 
vendors, but that it was being used.  I don't care if IGES is a poor substitute 
for better methodology;  until US industry actually accepts and implements a 
better mousetrap, we [BRL] would gain nothing by either waiting for ISO STEP 
or developing a better near-term mousetrap UNLESS we could gain immediate 
participation by Sikorsky, McDonnell Douglas, Bell, Boeing, Northrup, General 
Dynamics, Lockheed, Grumman, Martin Marietta, etc., etc., which, in my opinion, 
is unlikely to happen in spite of the nobleness of the cause.

I'm glad you are aware of the trials and tribulations of the ANSI process.
(For the record, after the ANSI exercise of adopting IGES V 2.0 in which
you participated [I have most of the original paperwork of THAT exercise and
am really glad you folks were the ones that broke the ice, because that
experience made the follow-up task(s) much easier], that ANSI subcommittee 
went into hibernation.  When it reactivated, I was asked to help out and 
subsequently got stuck with the job resolving the ballot comments when IGES 
V 3.0  was balloted.  We're currently in the process of bringing up V 4.0
to ballot [and will most likely be involved in PDES/STEP when it matures].)
I hope you'll agree that V 4.0 bears little resemblance to V 2.0, although
still deficient by PDES/STEP "standards."

Your proposal for a dialogue of ideas and a wish list is a good one.  And
so is the "two-year" project.   If successful, there is a very good
possibility it would influence and make an impact on the PDES/STEP (and
ultimately ISO STEP) work.

Since you agree that your concerns are not in the BRL/IGES mutual
benefits area and I agree that the industry need something more complete 
than the current IGES, let's drop this discussion from this cad list 
and continue privately and with other folks who have an interest.  That poor 
soul who asked how to model a coil spring will be afraid to ask 
another question!

I believe there is a procedure called "Grahm-Schmidt
orthonormalization" that functionally does what you want, but it
may be computationally expensive.  I can't find it right now.
You may want to look it up.

Rotation matrices are orthonormal matrices which have the property
that they are their own inverse.  You might consider the following.
Let
A   be estimate of current orthonormal matrix.
E   matrix of errors of elements in A.
Then
     (A-E)* (A-E) = I
     A*A - 2A*E + E*E = I     (If  E << I, and E << A, then E*E ~= 0 )
     E ~= 1/2 ( A*A - I ).

So compute improved estimate as

     A' = A - 1/2 ( A*A - I )

If this works at all, it will only work when the errors
are relatively small.  Basic cost is one matrix multiply.  Note that
no magnitudes involving square roots are involved.

sin(theta1)   sin(theta2)
----------- = ----------
    n1            n2

(theta1 and theta2 are angles)

If n1 is 1 (like for a vacuum) and n2 is bigger than 1 (like glass) then 
theta2 is smaller than theta1.  Note that if it is the other way around,
that is, the ray goes from an optically dense material to an optically
less dense material, (like a ray coming out of glass), then theta2 is 
bigger than theta1.  (Maybe this is where you are screwing up?)

Also, if you are solving for sin(theta2) and you get a number bigger than 1,
it means that the ray should be totally internally reflected.  This is why 
when you look up from the bottom of a pool, everything above the water looks 
like it is in a round window above your head.

There are other considerations.  The ratio of light reflected to  
transmitted is dependent on the angle but I can't remember that stuff.

Also, reflected and transmitted light is polarized (also dependent on the 
angle).  Pelicans have polarized filters in their eyes to see fish in the 
water better.  Bees have polarized eyes to navigate with sunlight on cloudy
days.

Some crystals have different indecies of refraction for light polarized in
different directions.  When you look through them you see two images.

And on and on...

     This subject has been studied in some detail by developers of flight
simulators.  See "Flight Simulation", by J.M Rolfe and K.J. Staples,
ISBN 0-521-35751-9, section 7.2, "The Psychophysics of Visual Perception".
They identify eight main non-binocular cues of distance, which I will not

     "Flight Simulation" references T. Gold, 1972, "The Limits of Stereopsis
For Depth Perception in Dynamic Visual Situation", Society for Information
Display, International Symposium, Digest of Technical Papers, who reports
that stereopsis dominates differential size and motion parallax out to
about 17m (64m if the observer fixates his eyes on the moving object.)
This is with the observer moving at about 0.5m/sec.  Faster movement
brings the limit closer.  This is somewhat beyond the reach of the hands,
and in fact stereo vision systems have been built for in-flight refueling
simulators.

       Viewing fatigue for 3D imagery is a serious problem.  The phenomenon
is moderately well understood, and has been written up in technical papers
of the SMPTE, from the point of view of understanding how to make 3D movies.
When viewing images that are not in the same scale as real life, some rather
strict rules must be followed to avoid visual fatigue.  Unfortunately, I
don't have the paper around, but it was by someone in Hollywood who provides
3D gear to filmmakers.  One useful gadget they offer is a pocket calculator
preprogrammed with the calculations needed to set up a shot for 3D.  For
close-ups, this is non-trivial.  They also offer a special leader for 3D
films that allows the projectionist to align the system properly.  Failure 
to do this correctly will induce headaches in some of the audience.

where,	n = m  e  { 1 + sqrt[ 1 + square( L s / 2 pi c e) ] } / 2
             r  r

	e = Ralative permittivity of the material

	s = conductivity of the material
	pi= 3.14...
	c = speed of light in the material
	e = permittivity of the material

For dielectric materials like glass, s = 0. Therefore K = 0
leaving only the real part for a good approximation.

Unfortunately cursors with color weren't part of the original
"frame buffer model" that we adopted in libfb.  Often the color
of a hardware cursor can't be set, or it comes from its own
color map, or it is defined by a boolean operation, etc.  The
fb_setcursor() routine only defines the size, shape, and active
point, for hardware with changeable cursors - no color.

We could try to add a command for this but it would be hard
to make it portable.  You might want to consider doing something
like the following for hardware specific graphics commands:

#ifdef sgi
	/* See if we are using a local SGI display */
	if( strncmp(fbp->if_name, "/dev/sgi", sizeof("/dev/sgi")) == 0 ) {
		/* SGI one color cursor */
		mapcolor( 1, red, green, blue );
	}
#endif

[In reality the SGI is more difficult because there are three different
kinds of cursors available.]

Games like this of course wont work for remote frame buffers.

Here's some C code to compute the refracted ray direction.

Aside to Thant:
    Actually, Snell's law is n1*sin(theta1)=n2*sin(theta2);
    you were using the reciprocals of the indices of refraction.

Below is an excerpt of some notes I wrote for the Intro to Ray Tracing
SIGGRAPH tutorial.  (These notes are coming out soon as a book from Academic
Press, by Glassner, Arvo, Cook, Haines, Hanrahan, and Heckbert.
Included in the book is a derivation of the following formulas
from Snell's Law, which I would have included here except it's written in
eqn and troff and uses paste-up figures).

---------------------------------

Below is C code for SpecularDirection and TransmissionDirection,
routines which compute secondary ray directions.
The following formulas generate unit output vectors if given unit input vectors.

/*
 * SpecularDirection: compute specular direction R from incident direction
 * I and normal N.
 * All vectors unit.

SpecularDirection(I, N, R)

 * medium with refractive index n2, with refraction governed
 * by Snell's law:  n1*sin(theta1) = n2*sin(theta2).
 * If there is total internal reflection, return 0, else set T and return 1.
 * All vectors unit.
 */
TransmissionDirection(n1, n2, I, N, T)
double n1, n2;
Point I, N, T;
{
    double eta, c1, cs2;

    eta = n1/n2;			/* relative index of refraction */
    c1 = -VecDot(I, N);			/* cos(theta1) */
    cs2 = 1.-eta*eta*(1.-c1*c1);	/* cos^2(theta2) */
    if (cs2<0.) return 0;		/* total internal reflection */
    VecComb(eta, I, eta*c1-sqrt(cs2), N, T);
    return 1;
}

where
    double VecDot(A, B)		dot product: returns A.B
    VecComb(a, A, b, B, C)	linear combination: C = aA+bB
    VecAddS(a, A, B, C)		add scalar multiple: C = aA+B

Whitted gives formulas for the refracted ray direction in his classic

Time to mention the *other* high-definition film system -
IMAX/OMNIMAX:

IMAX is a system that uses 15-perforation frames running horizontally -
each frame uses 3 times the film area as Showscan.  IMAX runs at a
conventional 24 frames per second.  OMNIMAX use the same film, camera,
and projectors as IMAX, except that the camera uses a sort of fisheye
lens to obtain a 180 degree field of view, and the image is projected
onto the inner surface of a dome.

Showscan and IMAX consume just about the same amount of film per second
_ Showscan runs 2.5 times as fast as normal 70mm but the frame is the
same size, while IMAX uses 3 times the film area at the normal frame
rate.  So the "data rate" is the same, but the two systems use it
differently.

The Showscan screen may be quite *wide*, but it's not very high.  The
frame size is the same as normal theatrical 70mm, 2.072 x 0.906, 5
perforations per frame.  IMAX frames are 2.032 x 2.772 inches.  (Both
figures are camera apertures; I'll ignore projector apertures for the
sake of simplicity).

If we pick an arbitrary screen width of 60 feet, a Showscan screen will
be only 26 feet high while an IMAX screen is 44 feet high.  Thus, IMAX
does a much better job of "covering the human field of view"
vertically.  Showscan does have the advantage of a brighter image on
screen, mostly because it is covering less screen.

When covering the same screen width, a Showscan frame is being
magnified 34% more than an IMAX one, so each IMAX image is sharper.  On
the other hand, projecting more images per second increases apparent
sharpness, so Showscan probably doesn't lose anything here.

Showscan uses standard 70mm equipment, modified a bit.  IMAX uses
custom-built cameras with 4 registration pins and a vacuum pressure
plate to hold the film flat.  The projectors use fixed registration
pins and hold the film flat against a glass block using compressed
air.  As a result, IMAX has very little image jitter on screen compared
with any other film format.  Note that this is not a fundamental
difference between the two formats, just a practical one.

So what's the net result?  For rapid motion, either of the camera or
the subject, Showscan looks great while IMAX images flicker and
strobe.  But when the camera and scene are stationary or moving slowly,
IMAX gives a "window into the world" quality that Showscan can't,
because of the narrower field and more jitter.  (If you get a chance,
see the footage of the earth shot from space in "Hail Columbia" -
you'll see what I mean.)  Which system is better depends on the subject
matter.

By the way, to compare this to computer displays, a good IMAX
projection print will have 40 lp/mm resolution.  That's 80 pixels/mm,
2032 pixels/inch, for an equivalent resolution of 5600 x 4130 pixels.
What sort of computer display hardware would be needed to generate that
at 24 fps?  As someone else pointed out, flight simulator people are
working on generating high resolution only where the pilot is currently
looking, with quite low resolution elsewhere, to minimize computing.
However, you can't do that with an audience of more than one.

About 3D:  IMAX and Omnimax are particularly good systems for 3-D.
Vertical misalignment between the two images of a stereo pair gives
people headaches, and vertical jitter produces this sort of
misalignment.  IMAX has very low jitter, and any jitter that remains is
mostly horizontal.  Omnimax has the potential of really surrounding you
with a 3-D environment.

3D films have been made in both IMAX and Omnimax.  If there is
interest, I can re-post an article on IMAX 3D that I originally posted
about 3 years ago.

			FYI

With the new release of BRLCAD 3.0 the following has changed
with reference to rle images. 

There are three different types of rle images: versions 1, 2, and 3
The latest rle software from utah uses version 3. and the various
programs which use rle in brlcad have been changed to to use the new
library which is much more portable, and many new tools for changing
and combining rle images are now included from Utah. Version 2 rle files
can be read from version 3 programs but version 1 files cannot be read
with the new software (version 3 ).... Since Nov 1987 we have been using
the version 2 format and previous to that we used version 1. I have gone
through the /demo directory and converted all version 1 files to version
3.

I was unable to go through each individuals directories and change 
the rle files which were located outside the demo directory. To test
your rle files and convert them you can to the following...

	rlehdr file.rle
		this will tell you if its not an RLE file which means
		its probably a version 1 file.

	If rlehdr does not recognize the rle format.
	than you can convert it by the following
	sequence of commands.


	1> fbcmap 0
	2> orle-fb file.rle
	3> fb-rle file.rle.new
					#verif that it worked.

Since disk space is usually small its best to use a real frame buffer for
conversion.  Version 2 and version 1 files can still be read by the orle-fb
program...

If you have questions regarding this or need help Please send me mail

Although there have been many postings explaining how the SuperBowl
3D effect worked, I thought those of you wondering about the details
may be interested in the following paper just published.  Pulfrich
published his paper in 1922 by the way.

A Physiological Correlate of the Pulfrich Effect
in Cortical Neurons of the Cat
   Thom Carney, Michael Paradiso, Ralph Freeman
   Vision Research (1989), vol29 no2, pp 155-165

The abstract says:
"We found that placing a filter before one of the cat's eyes
produced a temporal delay in the cortical response."

From a quick skim of the paper, the size of the delays they find
are roughly 11 and 29 milliseconds, for 1 and 2 log unit filters.

Subject: Re:  Personal IRIS benchmarks
To: info-iris@@BRL.MIL

We quote 5,900 Z-buffered, Gouraud shaded, 4 sided 100x100 independent
polygons per second on the Personal Iris.  The 100,000 polygons/second
figure you heard is for the GTX products.

Will you get 5,900 polygons per second in your application?  Not if:
1) You spend any time computing the polygons, or spend any time
	re-organizing the vertex data to match the v() commands.
2) You spend any time clearing your window or z-buffer (remember, it
	takes ~10 microseconds to clear the screen, so at 30 frames/second
	~20 percent of your time is spent just clearing the	framebuffer).
3) You have big polygons (bigger than 10 by 10 pixels).
4) You use the old drawing commands.
5) You draw few polygons in double-buffered mode.  Worst case is
	drawing one polygon, then swapping buffers-- the swapbuffers()
	command has to wait for the vertical retrace of the monitor you
	are using, so you will get only ~60 polygons/second.

The benchmark used to get the 5,900 poly/sec number is, of course,
nowhere close to a real application.  It is single-buffered, never
clears the framebuffer or z-buffer, and has almost no CPU overhead,
and draws only 100 pixel polygons.  But it does give you an idea of
maximum drawing speed.

Subject:  Re:  Dials & buttons

Yes, all our SGI's have the dials and buttons. We use them both in MGED
(big program) and in PL-SGI (small program); both are in the CAD
Package.

I'll send a copy of pl-sgi.c under separate cover, although
it has not changed since Release 3.0.

If you say "pl-sgi < /dev/null", press rightmouuse and select the "Axis"
menu item, you can get a simple test.

Turn the Zoom knob five (5) full revolutions clockwise to enlarge
the purple axis display.  Then experiment with the 3 rotation and 3 xlate
knobs.

Press RESET button to return to original (small) view.

As another test, try:

	pixhist3d-pl /unix | pl-sgi

This will give a complex 3-d display. Start by turning the Zoom knob one
revolution counter-clockwise.

	Best,

Subject:  parallel librt usage

If you call LIBRT from a parallel application, and have
your application structure a_resource pointers pointing to
one of an array of resource strutures (rather than using
the default uni-processor resource structure supplied by
rt_shootray), then in Release 3.1 of BRL-CAD, one more line
of code will be required:

	resource[cpu].re_magic = RESOURCE_MAGIC;

This is because each resource structure is given a "magic number" to
check for valid pointers and memory corruption.

If you are concerned about maintaining source for both pre- and post-
Release 3.1 systems, this code can be #ifdef'ed:

#ifdef RESOURCE_MAGIC
        resource[cpu].re_magic = RESOURCE_MAGIC;
#endif

Sorry that an interface change was necessary, but this change allowed
Phil and I to catch a bug in the Gould C compiler that had been
haunting us for many weeks now.  It seems worthwhile that the
magic number protection should be carried forward in new versions.

	 -Mike

PS:  As usual, this only applies to the development version on SPARK.
(Until the release).

Subject:  xxx_prep() change

Internal to LIBRT, I have reduced the number of parameters to
the ft_prep() routines from 6 to 3.  This affected the startoff
of all the geometry routines (eg, g_arb.c, g_sph.c, etc), but
no application code should care.

This should provide a minor performance improvement -- the motivation
was due to some general interface cleanup.

Subject:  Sliders, etc

This evening, I have integrated Bill's slider code into MGED,
with some enhancements;  the sliders seem to work fine both
with and without a button box.

Lee has provided several new programs for the util directory,
including pix-sun, alias-pix, pix-alias, pixcolors.

Pixcolors is the most notable of these -- it gives a list of
all the unique colors used in an image, by maintaining a 2^24 bit
bit-vector in memory.  This is a neat new capability, especially
useful when preparing images for display devices with limited color
resolution (eg, Mac II).

This completes the list of "features pending for Release 3.1", the
next step is to finish the integration and testing phase.

Subject:  Alliant 3.0 cc bug

Integration testing for the latest BRL-CAD release has disclosed a
problem with the C compiler (/bin/cc) on Concentrix 3.0. I have not been
able to check the compiler on later releases.

With these data structure:

struct aface {
	fastf_t	A[3];			/* "A" point */
	fastf_t	N[3];			/* Unit-length Normal (outward) */
	fastf_t	NdotA;			/* Normal dot A */
};
struct arb_specific  {
	int		arb_nmfaces;	/* number of faces */
	struct oface	*arb_opt;	/* pointer to optional info */
	struct aface	arb_face[4];	/* May really be up to [6] faces */
};

This code fragment fails:

              for( i=0; i < pa.pa_faces; i++ )
                      arbp->arb_face[i] = pa.pa_face[i];      /* struct copy */

This is the workaround:

              {
                      register struct aface   *aip, *aop;
                      aip = &pa.pa_face[pa.pa_faces-1];
                      aop = &arbp->arb_face[pa.pa_faces-1];
                      for( i=pa.pa_faces-1; i>=0; i--, aip--, aop-- )  {
                              *aop = *aip;    /* struct copy */
                      }
              }

Gary Moss' earlier remarks that the Alliant sometimes has problems
with structure copies are certainly true.

Since this workaround is more efficient than the earlier version,
I have adopted it as the installed version of the code.
However, we should continue to be vigilant when performing struct
copies on the Alliant.  As 3.0 is very old, I don't want any
response from Alliant -- just wanted others to know.

< When zooming out, fbed should make sure that the displayed image

This is actually intentional.  If you want the image framed WRT the window,
hit <return>, otherwise it is useful to be able to have the border of the

especially while zooming.

Subject:  New libpkg

Yesterday and today, Phil and I have been stalking a mysterious
problem that turned out to be in libpkg!

The program fbframe, when run over a PKG connection to a remote
framebuffer daemon, with the remote /dev/debug specified, caused
a variable number of debugging messages to come back (either 2,
or the expected 6).

It turns out that under conditions of very heavy "burst" traffic,
such as this test generated, PKG messages could be processed out
of order.  This was due to always giving priority to reading new
input over sending output.  In fbframe, what happened was the
packet representing fb_close() wound up getting processed *before*
the last four fb_writerect() messages, and fb_close() cut off
the connection.

This is a rather rare case, but PKG users, especially heavy-duty
users like the ADDCOMPE folks, should retrieve the latest version
from spark:/m/cad/libpkg for inspection.  Now that the bug is known,
I'd hate to learn of it bothering somebody else.

The new version is greatly revampped, and uses significantly fewer
system calls (always 1/2 as many, usually 1/3 as many), and for
a test case of the old single-pixel-I/O "fbgrid" program, this
new bug fixed version of libpkg also provided five times greater
performance (36 seconds -vs- 2:38) for the same high-traffic test.

The new version of libpkg will be included in the upcomming BRL-CAD
release.  For those of you waiting somewhat impatiently, it is finding
and fixing the last little "nits" like this that are taking the extra
time.

Subject:  xmp adb/dbx & multi-tasking

I encountered a series of operand range errors in some multi-tasking
code that I was debugging on the XMP this past evening.  Unfortunately,
debugging proved to be very difficult, as both ADB and DBX were unable
to provide any useful information from the core dump.  It seems that
core dumps from multi-tasking processes cause the debuggers some
trouble, even under UNICOS 4.

I will greatly appreciate all efforts made to find some technique for
extracting information from these multi-tasking core dumps.

The immediate need has passed.  Stumpped by the debuggers, I decided to
display my core dump on a framebuffer.  I was able to visually determine
that the buffer of interest required a file offset of one byte, and a
"pixel" offset of 400 scanlines.  The command line was:

( gencolor -r1 0 ; cat core ) | pix-fb -w512 -n2048 -S 512 -y400

This permitted me to see which pixel was the last one to be added to
the output buffer, and, as it turns out, thus guess the subroutine
which was having the difficulty.  Not the best way to debug, but it worked.
