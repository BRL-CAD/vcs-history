@Some notes on using BRL-CAD on Sun Workstations (Release 3.0):

As of Release 3.0 MGED is much improved on the Suns.  It now opens
its own window which can be resized, iconified, etc., like other
windows under SunTools.

While a generic replacement for knobs and buttons was not completed,
the function keys F1-F7 help somewhat.  Pressing these keys attaches
certain "knob" functions to the mouse X or Y motions:

F#	Function	Mouse
 1	Zoom		y
 2	Z Slew		y
 3	X Slew		x
 4	Y Slew		y
 5	X Rotate	x
 6	Y Rotate	y
 7	Z Rotate	y

These keys can be used as "chords", e.g. pressing F3 and F4 together
will give you X and Y translates on the mouse.

Frame buffer support has also been greatly enhanced, but the released
version does not yet open its own window for display.  Rather, it
covers the window a frame buffer command was invoked from with the
display.  Panning and Zooming are now supported, as is shared memory.
"/dev/sunp" can be used to get private memory.
