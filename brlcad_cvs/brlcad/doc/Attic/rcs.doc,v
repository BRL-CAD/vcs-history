@Per conversation with Lee, old file format specification documents
which can be better found on the Web have been removed from the
distribution.

@Here is the short scoop about using RCS, the Revision Control System:

co -l file.c
	To checkout a file and "lock it" so only you have access to it.
	Standard procedure to keep us from stepping on each others work.

ci -u file.c
	Check it in and "unlock" it so that other people can get at it
	again.  During checkin it asks you for a log message.  Type
	a short description of what you did - anything from two or
	three words to two or three lines.  Just a pointer as to
	what changed.

rlog file.c
	Tells you the state of the file (e.g. is it locked, if so by
	whom, etc.) and gives you all of the revision numbers, how
	many lines were added/deleted on each one, when it happened,
	and the log messages for each of those revisions.

rcsdiff -r# file.c
	Compares (diffs) and older version to the current one, where #
	is a revision number shown by rlog.

rcsdiff -r#1 -r#2 file.c
	Diffs two different revision of a file to each other.

You can check out a complete copy of any of these older revisions
via: "co -r# file.c", or to stdout by "co -p# file.c > output."
See rcs(1), ci(1), co(1), etc. for all the gory details.
