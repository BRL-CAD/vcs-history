@Per conversation with Lee, old file format specification documents
which can be better found on the Web have been removed from the
distribution.

@Here is the sequence you should follow to start learning about
the BRL CAD system -

1)  Get set up with an account on some 231 Sun workstation, some SGI
workstations, and either a Gould or Alliant. Learn about the Sun window
system, including how to do pop-up RLOGIN windows, cut-and-paste text,
etc.

2)  Read my "graphics, networking, workstations, and parallel
processing" paper.  Then read the brlcad(1) manual page.  (The paren
notation signifies what section of the manual it's in, and is useful
when using the MAN command. Ie, to read that page, run "man 1 brlcad".
Most of the manual pages I will refer to are also in the printed CAD
manual -- get a copy). Then read the pix(5) and pix-fb(1) pages.  Then
skim my "Understanding the Preparation and Analysis of Solid Models"
paper;  concentrate on extracting the "big picture" more than the
details.

3)  Get someone to run some of the SGI demos for you, and show you
a little about how the SGI window system ("MEX") works.  Then, have
them show you how to run pix-fb(1), rle-fb(1), and go off on your own and
browse through some of our images.  (spark:/m/cad/phd has some,
vgr:/demo/* has more, spark:/m/cad/pix has the benchmark images).

4)  Experiment with some of the image processing tools.  Using some
of the images you have found, experiment with the pixfilter(1) tool.
Try pixbackgnd(1) and pixmerge(1).  Each of the man pages should have
an example or two to get you started.

5)  Read the "MGED users guide" (in the back of the CAD manual).  Then,
have someone show you how to run MGED.  Do all your initial MGED work
on an SGI, logged in from a SUN window, so that your text commands are
typed on the Sun keyboard, and your graphics appears on the SGI screen.
Go and browse around and view various models (start by making a copy of
spark:/m/cad/db/moss.g to experiment with).  Learn how to run RT (the
ray-tracer) from within MGED, to see a shaded image of your model.
Then, learn how to modify the shapes in your model using MGED.

You should plan on devoting roughly a full day to each item. If you can
get through all that in less than a week, you get a gold star! The list
should help you keep focused.  If something appeals to you along the
way, feel free to take some time and pursue that a bit as well. If you
get stuck, try to look in a manual;  if 10-15 minutes of searching
does not help any, ask for help -- don't spin your wheels for long.

For ACST Team members:

*)  From the very beginning, you will have graphics-group permission, so
you will have write permission in most of our graphics directories.  I'm
sure that you will be careful not to modify things unintentionally -- if
something does happen, don't feel bad, just get help that same day, so
things can be reloaded from backups.
