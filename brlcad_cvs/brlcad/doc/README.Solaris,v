@BRL-CAD on Solaris README
=========================

If while compiling you encounter an error "Text relocation remains
against symbol" along with some number of lines following, it usually
means that the build has attempted to link a static system library
into a shared library being compiled (e.g. attempting to link a system
libz.a into the png library distributed in src/other/libpng being
compiled as libpng.so).

The fix/workaround is pretty simple.  Either install a shared verison
of the system library (e.g. libz.so) or run configure with the
-mimpure-text linker option: ./configure LDFLAGS=-mimpure-text
