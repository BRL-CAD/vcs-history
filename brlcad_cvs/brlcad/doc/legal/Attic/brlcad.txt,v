@BRL-CAD LICENSE AGREEMENT
STATEMENT OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR RELEASE OF THE BRL-CAD PACKAGE

The Federal Government of the United States of America is hereinafter
"THE GOVERNMENT".

The U. S. Army Research Laboratory, hereinafter "ARL", an agency of
THE GOVERNMENT, is the originator of The BRL-CAD Package.

The BRL-CAD Package is a collection of computer programs, data files,
and associated documentation, hereinafter "BRL-CAD". BRL-CAD is
provided in machine-readable form and may be obtained in either
"binary executable" or "source code" editions. This license applies to
both editions.

BRL-CAD and the "BRL-CAD Eagle" are trademarks of the United States
Army.

The DTIC Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center,
hereinafter "SURVIAC", administers the supported BRL-CAD distributions
and information exchange programs on behalf of ARL.

The corporation or private individual requesting BRL-CAD as identified
on page two is hereinafter the "RECIPIENT".

Changes made to any files provided with BRL-CAD are hereinafter
"MODIFICATIONS". New files entirely created by RECIPIENT are
hereinafter "EXTENSIONS".

1.  BRL-CAD is an unpublished work that is not generally available to
    the public, except through the terms of this limited
    distribution. ARL grants RECIPIENT a personal, non-exclusive,
    non-transferable license and right to use BRLCAD. No right is
    granted for any use of BRL-CAD by any third party.

2.  RECIPIENT will be responsible for assuring that BRL-CAD will not
    be released or sold to any other party without the prior written
    approval of ARL.

3. RECIPIENT guarantees that BRL-CAD, and any modified versions
   thereof, will not be published for profit or in any manner offered
   for sale to THE GOVERNMENT. BRL-CAD may be used in contracts with
   THE GOVERNMENT but no development charge may be made as part of its
   use.

4.  If RECIPIENT makes MODIFICATIONS to BRL-CAD, then RECIPIENT agrees
    to provide a copy of all such MODIFICATIONS to ARL in source code
    form. RECIPIENT agrees that such MODIFICATIONS may be used by ARL
    and the entire BRL-CAD user community.

5.  RECIPIENT will own full rights to any EXTENSIONS to BRL-CAD they
    create.

6.  RECIPIENT will own full rights to any data files, databases or
    images created using BRL-CAD.

7.  BRL-CAD is provided "as is", without warranty. Neither THE
    GOVERNMENT nor SURVIAC is liable or responsible for maintenance,
    updating, or correcting any errors in any materials provided. In
    no event shall THE GOVERNMENT or SURVIAC be liable for any loss or
    for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental, or
    consequential damages arising from use, possession, or performance
    of BRL-CAD.

8.  The RECIPIENT shall indemnify and hold harmless THE GOVERNMENT for
    any loss, claim, damage, expense, or liability of any kind
    occurring as a result of the making, using, or selling of a
    product, process, or service by or on behalf of RECIPIENT, its
    assignees and licensees, which was derived from BRL-CAD.

9.  ARL will be credited should BRL-CAD be used in a product or
    written about in any publication. ARL will be referenced as the
    original source for BRL-CAD, however, the RECIPIENT shall not in
    any way imply that THE GOVERNMENT endorses any product or service
    of the RECIPIENT.

10.  RECIPIENT agrees that when bugs or problems are found with
     BRL-CAD, a reasonable attempt will be made to report them to
     SURVIAC or ARL.

11.  RECIPIENT agrees to complete and return the "Recipient Survey
     Form" attached below.

conditions of the BRL-CAD distribution license agreement as detailed
