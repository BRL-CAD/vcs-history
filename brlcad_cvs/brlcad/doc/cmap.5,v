.SH NAME
cmap \- Framebuffer colormap file format and utilities
.SH FORMAT
A
.I cmap
file is a storage format for framebuffer colormaps.
It is an ascii file with one line per colormap entry.
In order to accommodate colormaps of any "depth" (number
of bits per entry), 16 bit unsigned integers were selected
(see
.IR libfb (3)
for a discussion of the C program interface to colormaps).
A value of zero corresponds to full off, or black, a
value of 65535 decimal or ffff hexidecimal corresponds to
full on, or white.  A given device will use as many of
the "leftmost" bits as it can support.
.PP
Each line of the file has a decimal colormap index, followed
by a tab character, and then three 4 digit
hexadecimal values, separated by spaces, which correspond to
the red, green, and blue, channels.  Any blank lines or lines
beginning with non-numeric characters are ignored, and can thus
be used for comments.
.PP
There is no requirement for all 256 entries to be specified.
What is done with any unspecified entries is up to the individual
programs using the colormap.
.SH EXAMPLE
The beginning of an eight bit inverse video colormap might look
as follows:
.sp 1
.nf
	# Inverse video colormap
	0       ff00 ff00 ff00
	1       fe00 fe00 fe00
	2       fd00 fd00 fd00
	3       fc00 fc00 fc00
	4       fb00 fb00 fb00
.sp 1
.SH UTILITIES
.B fb-cmap
save a colormap from a framebuffer.
.br
.B cmap-fb
load a saved colormap into a framebuffer.
.br
.B fbcmap
loads one of several "standard" colormaps.
.br
.B fbgamma
loads gamma correcting colormaps.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
