@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@BRL-CAD Copying and Distribution
================================

BRL-CAD is Open Source software with copyright primarily held by the
U.S. Government.  The source code is controlled and maintained by a
core team of Open Source developers working around the world.  Those
core developers operate under a meritocracy organizational structure
adhering to developer guidelines outlined in the HACKING developer's
guide and to the legal conventions and requirements outlined in this
document.

As a unified work, BRL-CAD is made available under the terms of the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) as published by the Free
Software Foundation.

As distinctly organized and separate components, parts of BRL-CAD are
made available under different licenses for different portions
including the BSD license and files in the public domain The Overview
below describes how the various licenses apply to the different
portions of BRL-CAD.

BRL-CAD is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public
License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this file.  If you did not, please contact one of
the BRL-CAD project administrators listed at the SourceForge project
site http://sf.net/projects/brlcad/ or listed in the AUTHORS file
included as part of the distribution.

Overview
--------

BRL-CAD consists primarily of libraries, applications, scripts,
documentation, geometric models, images, data resources, and build
infrastructure.  The BRL-CAD libraries include the headers in the
include/ directory as well as all of the directories that begin with
the prefix "lib" in the src/ directory (e.g. src/librt/).  All of
BRL-CAD's libraries, applications, and any content lacking a library
specification are covered by the terms of the LGPL.

Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure including files required by the
GNU Build System (such as the configure.ac and all Makefile.am files),
a variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/ directories, and the
testing infrastructure (scripts and resources) are provided either
under the BSD license or are in the public domain.  Similarly, most of
the geometric models, images, and other data resources are also
provided under the BSD license.  Refer to each individual file for
specific terms.

BRL-CAD's documentation consists of manual pages located throughout
the package, most of the files in the doc/ directory, and the
top-level administrative project text files (e.g. README & AUTHORS).
Unless otherwise denoted, all of BRL-CAD's documentation is made
available under the terms of the BSD Documentation License (BDL) or
are in the public domain.  Refer to each document for specific terms.

The full text of the LGPL, BDL, and BSD license should be included in
the source distribution of BRL-CAD in the doc/legal/ directory.  Refer
to the full license text for more details, information, requirements,
and implications of each license.

3rd-Party Components
--------------------

The BRL-CAD package utilizes and redistributes several 3rd party
source codes, libraries, and applications.  Said 3rd party source
code, libraries, and applications all retain their respective
agreements, licenses, and copyrights and should be referred to
individually for their specific terms.  For the purposes of
redistribution and legal compatibility for all of BRL-CAD's existing
user base, NO 3RD PARTY LIBRARIES SHALL BE INCLUDED THAT ARE UNDER THE
TERMS OF THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE or any other license with
similar legal implications that would impose legal obligations on
external codes that utilize BRL-CAD as a library.

When referring to BRL-CAD, its source code, documentation, and
libraries, the reference is not meant to include or imply 3rd party
source code, libraries, and/or applications unless specifically stated
otherwise.  No endorsement or claim of authorship is implied to any
3rd party asset that is included with BRL-CAD.  The majority of the
3rd party source code, libraries, and applications included with
BRL-CAD are located in the src/other/ directory of the source code
distribution.

Copyright
---------

All contributions to BRL-CAD have been provided under agreement.  By
requiring all contributions be given back to the BRL-CAD developers,
this agreement allows the BRL-CAD project to continue to grow
unhindered.  As such, a majority of the source code is copyright by
the United States Government as represented by the United States Army
Research Laboratory.

Authors and other BRL-CAD contributors must comply with the copyright
terms for their respective contributions unless otherwise noted or
arranged.  This includes an implicit assignment of copyright for any
and all contributions being made.  The following notice should be
prominent in the BRL-CAD sources:

  Copyright (c) 2007 United States Government as represented by
  the U.S. Army Research Laboratory.

Trademark
---------

The word mark "BRL-CAD" and the "BRL-CAD Eagle" image are registered

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

BRL-CAD Copying and Distribution
================================
d4 337
a340 125
BRL-CAD is Open Source software with copyright primarily held by the
U.S. Government.  The source code is controlled and maintained by a
core team of Open Source developers working around the world.  Those
core developers operate under a meritocracy organizational structure
adhering to developer guidelines outlined in the HACKING developer's
guide and to the legal conventions and requirements outlined in this
document.

As a unified work, BRL-CAD is made available under the terms of the
GNU General Public License (GPL) as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

As distinctly organized and separate components, parts of BRL-CAD are
made available under different licenses for different portions.  These
licenses include but are not necessarily limited to the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL), the GNU Free Documentation License
(GFDL), and the BSD license.  The Overview below describes how the
various licenses apply to the different portions of BRL-CAD.

BRL-CAD is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License
for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this file.  If you did not, please contact one of the
BRL-CAD project administrators listed at the SourceForge project site
http://sf.net/projects/brlcad/ or in the AUTHORS file included as part
of the distribution.

Overview
--------

BRL-CAD consists primarily of libraries, applications, scripts,
documentation, geometric models, images, and build infrastructure.
The BRL-CAD libraries include the headers in the include/ directory as
well as all of the directories that begin with the prefix "lib" in the
src/ directory (e.g. src/librt/).  All of BRL-CAD's libraries are
covered by the terms of the LGPL as published by the Free Software
Foundation unless noted otherwise in the source files.

Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure (i.e. files required by the GNU
Build System such as the configure.ac and all Makefile.am files), a
variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/ directories, and the
testing infrastructure (scripts and resources) are provided either
under the BSD license or are in the public domain.  Refer to each
individual file for specific terms.

BRL-CAD's documentation consists of manual pages located throughout
the package, most of the files in the doc/ directory, and the
top-level administrative project text files (e.g. README & AUTHORS).
Unless otherwise denoted, all of BRL-CAD's documentation is made
available under the terms of the GFDL or, at your option, under the
terms of the GPL as published by the Free Software Foundation.  Refer
to each document individually for specific terms.

Unless previously described or otherwise already covered by another
license, the BRL-CAD package is covered under the terms of the GPL as
published by the Free Software Foundation.  This includes but is not
limited to the applications, geometric models, images, and other
resource data included in the BRL-CAD distribution.

The full text of the GPL, LGPL, GFDL, and BSD license should be
included in the source distribution of BRL-CAD in the doc/legal/
directory.  Refer to the full license text for more details,
information, requirements, and implications of each license.

3rd-Party Components
--------------------

The BRL-CAD package utilizes and redistributes copies of several 3rd
party source code, libraries, and/or applications.  Said 3rd party
source code, libraries, and/or applications all retain their
respective agreements, licenses, and copyrights and should be referred
to individually for their specific terms.  For purposes of
redistribution and legal compatibility, external component libraries
should not be under the terms of the GPL or any other license with
similar legal implications.

When referring to BRL-CAD, its source code, documentation, and/or
libraries, this is not meant to include or imply 3rd party source
code, libraries, and/or applications unless specifically stated
otherwise.  The majority of the 3rd party source code, libraries, and
applications included with BRL-CAD are located in the src/other/
directory of the source code distribution.

Copyright
---------

All contributions to BRL-CAD have been provided under agreement.  By
requiring all contributions be given back to the BRL-CAD developers,
this agreement allows the BRL-CAD project to continue to grow
unhindered.  As such, a majority of the source code is copyright by
the United States Government as represented by the United States Army
Research Laboratory.

Authors and other BRL-CAD contributors must comply with the copyright
terms for their respective contributions unless otherwise noted or
arranged.  The following notice should be prominent in the BRL-CAD
sources:

  Copyright (c) 2005-2006 United States Government as represented by
  the U.S. Army Research Laboratory.  All Rights Reserved.

Trademark
---------

The word mark "BRL-CAD" and the "BRL-CAD Eagle" image are registered
trademarks of the Department of the Army, United States Government.
All rights are reserved.

@the BRL-CAD documentation is available under a dual-license strategy allowing for recepients to choose between the GFDL and GPL.  this allows for the documentation to be included on otherwise opaque distribution mediums and over-zealous packaging distributions that don't seem to agree with allowing minor invariant sections (which none of brl-cad's docs have anyways).
