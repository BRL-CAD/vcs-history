@.TH SECPASS 1 BRL/CAD
.SH NAME
secpass \- interrogates an mged file to obtain the conductivity table
of the PRISM-ready input file or a generic thermal data file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B secpass
model.g objects...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Secpass is an interactive program used to create a conductivity
table for the PRISM-ready input file (when used in conjunction
with firpass) or a generic thermal data file.  The conduction approximation
is based on the following formula from the PRISM manual.
.nf

	RK(i,j) =             1
		    ---------------------------
		      L(i)/K(i)A + L(j)/K(j)A 

	RK(i,j) - conductivity between region i and j
	L(i)    - conduction path length of region i
	L(j)    - conduction path length of region j
	K(i)    - conductivity of material of region i
	K(j)    - conductivity of material of region j
	A       - shared surface area

.fi
The conduction path length is a distance between the centroid of
the region and the shared surface.  The user may select the average,
root mean squared (rms), minimum, or maximum distance for the length.
.sp
The following information about each region is obtained from
secpass when creating a PRISM ready file.
.nf

	number (same scheme as in firpass)
	number of region there is conduction between
	conduction

.fi
The following information about each region is obtained when creating
a generic thermal data file
.nf

	number
	number of adjacent regions
	shared area of each adjacent region (m**2)
	conduction distance (m)
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example from an interactive session.
.nf

in it (15 char max).  veh.f.2nd

computing conduction
between regions?
	1 - average length

.SH CHANGES SINCE BRL-CAD RELEASE 4.0
1.  Made the numbering scheme for regions the same throughout all
irprep programs, i.e. region numbers start at one not zero.  This
affects the format of the diagnostic and error files.
.sp
.sp -1
2.  Correct the format of the conductivity file for PRISM.  The
larger region number must come first.
.sp
.sp -1
3.  The user is given a choice of a 2.0 PRISM format or a 3.0 PRISM
format.
.sp
.sp -1
4.  Some diagnostic information is no longer printed out.
.sp
.sp -1
5.  The user is given a choice of firing one set of rays or three
sets of orthogonal rays.
