.SH NAME
firpass \- interrogates an mged file to obtain the facet records of
a PRISM-ready input file, a generic thermal data file, or a geometric properties file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B firpass
model.g objects...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Firpass is an interactive program used to create a PRISM ready input
file (when used in conjunction with secpass), a generic thermal data
file, or a
geometric properties file.  The following information about each region
of the mged description may be obtained from firpass when creating a
PRISM ready file.
.nf

	number (arbitrarily assigned by rt_shootray plus one)
	name (25 right most characters of region name)
	type (set to 1)
	exterior surface area (m**2) (surface bounding exterior air)
	mass (kg)
	specific heat (J/kg degree C)
	emissivity
	surface normal unit vector (averaged over free surface of region)
	convection coefficient (set to 1)
	region number seen by back surface (set to 0)
	region number seen by front surface (set to 0)
	shape factor (set to 0)
	hub radius (set to 0)
	bearing friction constant (set to 0)

.fi
The variables set to 0 or 1 need to be changed by the user for special
cases.
.sp
The following information about each region is obtained when creating
a generic thermal data file.
.nf

	number (arbitrarily assigned by rt_shootray plus one)
	name (25 right most characters of region name)
	volume (m**3)
	density (kg/m3)
	thermal conductivity
	specific heat
	material
	number of external convection surfaces and areas (m**2)
	number of internal convection surfaces and areas (m**2)
	number of solar loaded surfaces and areas (m**2)
	external surface area
	surface normal unit vector (averaged over free surface of region)
	absorptivity

.fi
The following information about each region is obtained when creating
a geometric properties file.
.nf

	number (arbitrarily assigned by rt_shootray plus one)
	name (25 right most characters of region name)
	centroid
	volume (m**3)
	mass (kg)
	external surface area (m**2)
	engine surface area (m**2)
	crew surface area (m**2)
	closed compartment surface area (m**2)
	material code
	density (kg/m3)
	specific heat
	absorptivity
	emissivity
	thermal conductivity (W/mK)
	material
	all adjacent regions (up to 20)

.SH CHANGES SINCE BRL-CAD RELEASE 4.0
1.  Region number and name file is created for use with shapefact and
showtherm.
.sp
.sp -1
2.  The region number is the same across all irprep files, i.e.
region numbers start at one not zero.  This affects the diagnostic
file, the second pass file, and the error file.
.sp
.sp -1
3.  When there is engine air area it is printed in the the radius
field of the PRISM facet file.
.sp
.sp -1
4.  The user is given a choice of a PRISM format of PRISM 2.0 or
PRISM 3.0 for the facet file.
.sp
.sp -1
5.  Addition air types have been added:  closed compartment air,
exhaust air, generic air 1, and generic air 2.
.sp
.sp -1
6.  An additional line was added to the end of the PRISM facet
file to indicate the end of the file.  This line is required by
PRISM.
.sp
.sp -1
7.  If the exterior surface area is zero
the total surface area is written out in the exterior surface
area field in the PRISM facet file.  PRISM will not accept zero in
this field.
.sp
.sp -1
8.  The user is given a choice of firing one set of rays or three
sets of orthogonal rays.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
