.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR repos
repositions an RLE image.  Repos just changes the coordinates stored in
the RLE header (see

.B \-p
0 0 is assumed.
.TP
.BI \-p " xpos ypos"
Reposition the image to the absolute coordinates
.I xpos ypos.
.TP
.BI \-P " xinc yinc"
Move the image by 
.I xinc yinc
pixels from where it currently is (relative movement).
.TP
.I infile
The input will be read from this file, otherwise, input will
be taken from stdin.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
If specified, output will be written to this file, otherwise it will
go to stdout.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IR Repos
does not allow the image origin to have negative coordinates.
