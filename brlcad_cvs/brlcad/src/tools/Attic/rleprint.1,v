Each pixel is printed on a single line.  For example, a count of all
the unique pixel values in the file could be obtained by
.br
rleprint pic.rle | sort \-u | wc
.TP

The input will be read from this file.  If
.I infile
is "\-" or is not specified, the input will be read from the standard
input stream.
