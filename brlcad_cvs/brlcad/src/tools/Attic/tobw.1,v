.SH NAME
tobw \- Convert a 24 bit RLE file to eight bits of gray scale value.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tobw
[
.B \-t
] [
.B \-o
.I outfile
] [
.I infile
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR Tobw
converts an image with 24 bit pixel values (eight bits each of red,
green and blue) to eight bits of grayscale information.  The 
.I NTSC Y
transform is used.  If the
.B \-t
flag is given, then the monochrome pixel values are replicated on all three
output channels (otherwise, just one channel of eight bit data is produced).
If no input file is specified, 
.IR tobw
reads from stdin.  If no output file is specified with
.B \-o,
it writes the result to stdout.
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR to8 (1),
.IR urt (1),
.IR rgb_to_bw (3),
.IR RLE (5).
