.SH NAME
into \- copy into a file without destroying it
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B into
[
.B \-f
] 
.I outfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Into
copies its standard input into the specified
.I outfile,
but doesn't actually modify the file
until it gets EOF.
This is useful in a pipeline for putting stuff back in the "same place."
The
.I outfile
is not overwritten if that would make it zero length, unless
the
.B \-f
option is given.  That option also
forces overwriting of the
.I outfile
even if it is not directly writable (as long as the directory is writable).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
pipe(2)
.SH BUGS
For efficiency reasons, the directory containing the
.I outfile
must be writable by the invoker.
.br
The original
.I outfile's
owner is not preserved.
