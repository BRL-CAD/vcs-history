@since adrt uses malloc, add checks on use for a null return value.  this probably would be a good reason to being associating with libbu.. (this fixes sf bug 1680679 - Check return codes everywhere; submitted by Markus Elfring (elfring))

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@The project directory now has a single project file that lists the file names
for properties, textures, frames, geometry, and geometry arguments.  The
application no longer requires the -g and -a options.  IGVT has been updated
to reflect these changes, RISE is next.
