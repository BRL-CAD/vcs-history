@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@* Fixed the rendering weirdness on the slave start-up
  Slaves were requesting a work unit right after prep begins
  so that slaves were holding onto a work unit for a lengthy time
  until prep finished and causing the units to not get done until
  prep finished.
* Added compute nodes status to observer.
* Added Scale Factor status to observer.
* Changed bytes transfered to mibi bytes instead of kilobytes.
