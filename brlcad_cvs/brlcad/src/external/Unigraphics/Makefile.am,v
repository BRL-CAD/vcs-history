@remove the MAINTAINERCLEAN rules, they're never really used regardless of the debate over whether the Makefile.in files belong there or not

@restructure library linkages so that brl-cad libraries no longer list their dependencies as a LIBADD.  dependencies are moved into configure.ac and provided via _LIBS variables so that they are specified at link time.  this supports hybrid static library compilation as well as other more varied mixture configurations.  use the new _LIBS variables throughout.  probably want to re-combine them later into a single symbol name per library but this will suffice for now.

@update the usage of LIBRT from configure to be RT instead so that it is consistent with the other BU, BN, WDB etc library defines, using the LIB prefix mostly on third party or external libraries instead.

@moved the Unigraphics importer from src/conv/unigraphics to src/external/Unigraphics since it requires the external UGOPEN library api.
