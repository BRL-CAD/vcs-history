.SH NAME
ug-g \- Unigraphics Translator (Unigraphics to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ug-g
[-d level] [-i starting_ident_number] [-n part_no_to_part_name_mapping_file] [-t surface_tolerance] [-a surface_normal_tolerance] [-R use_refset_name] [-c min_chamfer] [-r min_round] [-f] [-s] [-u] -o database.g part_filename [subpart1 subpart2 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ug-g\^
converts the specified
.I part_filename
model to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file. The
.I part_filename
is expected to be a Unigraphics part file.
The
.I -d
specifies a debug
.I level.
Currently this is either on or off for levels 0 or 1.
The
.I -i
option specifies a starting ident number for the conversion. Each part converted will be assigned an ident
number, starting with the one specified. The
.I -n
option provides a part number to name mapping file. This can be provided if the Unigraphics model
uses part numbers instead of part names. If provided, the mapping file will be consulted for
part names during the conversion, and the BRL-CAD model will use the names rather than the part numbers.
The
.I -t
option specifies the surface error tolerance for tesellation (in mm). The
.I -a
option specifies an surface normal tolerance for tesellation (in degrees). The
.I -R
option specifies a Unigraphics reference set name. If supplied, only the specified reference set will be converted. The
.I -c
option specifies a minimum chamfer dimension. Any chamfers with dimensions of this minimum or less will be ignored. The
.I -r
option specifies a minimum round radius. Any rounds or blends with radii of curvature of this minimum or
less will be ignored. The
.I -f
option requests that no CSG conversion be attempted, so that all BRL-CAD geometry will be Bot primitives. The
.I -s
option requests that all features get listed rather than only those successfully converted to CSG. This option has no effect if the
.I -f
option is specified. The
.I -u
option requests surface normals to be extracted from the Unigraphics model and assigned to Bot primitives.
The
.I -o
option specifies a BRL-CAD output file for the conversion. If a list of optional
.I subparts
is specified on the command line, only those subparts of the Unigraphics
.I part_filename
are converted.
.PP
Note that this converter requires the Unigraphics
.I ugopen
module. This may be obtained from Unigraphics.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@moved the Unigraphics importer from src/conv/unigraphics to src/external/Unigraphics since it requires the external UGOPEN library api.
