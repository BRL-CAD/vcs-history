@Added Cubit
@
text
@Contained in this directory are codes that are written to work with
and/or link against external packages.  These codes are often written
as plugins, modules, or libraries to to some external package and
generally may not even attempt to compile if the optional codes are
not enabled during configure.  Even after being enabled, some manual
setup may be required so that these codes may find requisite external
headers or libraries that are needed for compilation.

Contents
--------

Cubit
	This code is a CUBIT translator that will read a given BRL-CAD
geometry file and convert the included 3D geometry to a CUBIT readable
representation (.sat).  This code utilizes the CUBIT's CGM API and must be
linked against CUBIT's CGM libraries and the ACIS CAD kernel.

EndgameFramework
	This code is a "Simulation Module" for the Endgame Framework
that provides BRL-CAD import functionality for v4/v5 binary geometry
database files.

ProEngineer
	This code is a Pro/Engineer exporter plugin module intended to
be used directly within the Pro/Engineer environment (e.g. Wildfire).
Compilation of this code requires Pro/Toolkit, a separately licensed
module from PTC.

Unigraphics
	This code is a Unigraphics (now called NX) importer that will
parse a given Unigraphics geometry file and convert the included 3D
geometry to a BRL-CAD representation.  This code utilizes the UGOPEN
API and must be linked against the UGOPEN libraries.
