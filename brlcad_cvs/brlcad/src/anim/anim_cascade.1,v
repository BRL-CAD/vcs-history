.SH NAME
anim_cascade - evaluate movement of an object relative to a moving frame of
reference
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anim_cascade [-s][-o(f|r|a)] [-(f|r|a)(c|y) # # #] <
.B input.table >
.B output.table
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Anim_cascade
is designed to enable the user to control the movement of objects relative to
other objects. In the normal mode of operation, the user supplies
the position and orientation of a (possibly moving) frame of reference and
the position
and orientation of an object relative to the frame of reference,
and
.I anim_cascade
produces the absolute position and orientation of the object at each
point in time.
All orientations are specified as yaw, pitch, and roll.
The columns of the input table are:
.sp
time fx fy fz fyaw fpitch froll rx ry rz ryaw rpitch rroll
.sp
and the columns of the output table are:
.sp
time ax ay az ayaw apitch aroll
.sp
Here "f" refers to the frame of reference, "r" refers to the position
and orientation of the object relative to the frame, and "a"
refers to the absolute position and orientation of the object.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-or
Output the relative position and orientation.
If this option is specified,
.I anim_cascade
will expect the absolute position and orientation of the frame of
reference and the object as input,
and will produce the position and orientation or the object relative to
the frame as output. The
input columns should be:
.sp
time fx fy fz fyaw fpitch froll ax ay az ayaw apitch aroll
.sp
and the output columns will be:
.sp
time rx ry rz ryaw rpitch rroll
.sp
.TP
.B \-of
Output the frame of reference.
If this option is specified,
.I anim_cascade
will expect the absolute and relative positions and orientations of the
object as input,
and will produce the corresponding frame of reference as output.
The input columns should be:
.sp
time ax ay az ayaw apitch aroll rx ry rz ryaw rpitch rroll
.sp
and the output columns will be:
.sp
time fx fy fz fyaw fpitch froll
.sp
.TP
.B \-fc # # #
Specify a constant position for the frame of reference. The
columns fx, fy, and fz should be omitted from the input table, and the
command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect if used
in conjunction with
.B -of
.TP
.B \-fy # # #
Specify a constant orientation for the frame of reference. The
columns fyaw, fpitch, and froll should be omitted from the input table,
and the command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect if used
in conjunction with
.BR -of .
.TP
.B \-rc # # #
Specify a constant position of the object relative to the frame
of reference. The
columns rx, ry, and rz should be omitted from the input table, and the
command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect if used
in conjunction with
.BR -or .
.TP
.B \-ry # # #
Specify a constant orientation of the object relative to the
frame of reference. The
columns ryaw,  rpitch, and rroll should be omitted from the input table,
and the command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect if used
in conjunction with
.BR -or .
.TP
.B \-ac # # #
Specify a constant absolute position for the object. The
columns ax, ay, and az should be omitted from the input table, and the
command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect unless used
in conjunction with
.B -or
or
.BR -of .
.TP
.B \-ay # # #
Specify a constant absolute orientation for the object. The
columns ayaw, apitch, and aroll should be omitted from the input table,
and the
command-line arguments will be used instead.
This has no effect unless used
in conjunction with
.B -or
or
.BR -of .
.TP
.B \-s
Suppress time column. No time column is read or written.
.sp
Note: When all of the input columns are specified with command-line arguments,
then standard input is not read and
only one line of output is produced. The time value will be set to zero,
unless it is suppressed.

.SH EXAMPLES
1. Suppose that you want the virtual camera to pan in a circle around a
moving vehicle, always staying a fixed distance from the vehicle.
There should already exist an animation table with the time, position,
and orientation of the vehicle in each frame. This will be the moving
frame of reference. Next, you should create an animation table which
describes how the camera would need to move if the vehicle stood still
at the origin. The columns of the second animation table should be
appended to the columns of the first table
(using
.IR paste ,
for example), to create the
input table.
.I Anim_cascade
will produce an absolute animation table for
the camera, suitable to use as input to
.IR anim_script :
.sp
anim_cascade < input.table | anim_script -v500 > view.script
.sp
2. Suppose that you have an animation path for an object and you want to
know when it crosses a given oblique plane. You can use the
.B -or
option to
find out what the position of the object is relative to the frame of
reference of the plane. Suppose that the plane is defined by the
equation:
.sp
 x + z = 0
.sp
In a frame of reference located at the origin with a pitch of 45
degrees, the x-axis is perpendicular to the given plane.
To convert the absolute animation path into this frame of reference, the command
would be:
.sp
anim_cascade -or -fc 0 0 0 -fy 0 45 0 < absolute.table > relative.table
.sp
Wherever the x coordinate in the output table is positive, the object
lies above the plane.
.sp
3. Suppose that one object is situated at the point (1,2,3) with a yaw,
pitch, and roll of (45, 25, 10). Suppose further that you want to
position a camera so that to the camera, the first object seems to be 10
units straight ahead, facing to the right. You could find the required
position and orientation of the camera with the following command:
.sp
anim_cascade -s -of -ac 1 2 3 -ay 45 25 10 -rc 10 0 0 -ry -90 0 0
.sp

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
