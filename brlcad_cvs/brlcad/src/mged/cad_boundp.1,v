.SH NAME
cad_boundp \- find bounding polygon of two-dimensional view
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cad_boundp
[
.B \-i
input
] [
.B \-o
output
] [
.B \-t
tolerance
] [
.B \-v
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I cad_boundp\^
reads from
.I input\^
(standard input if not specified)
a series of line segment endpoint
.RI ( x\^ , y\^ )
coordinate values
describing a two-dimensional view
of the edges of a
(possibly transparent)
three-dimensional object
and writes to
.I output\^
(standard output if not specified)
the
.RI ( x\^ , y\^ )
coordinates
of vertices of the bounding polygon
in counter-clockwise order,
starting with the vertex
having the smallest
.I y\^
coordinate.
If the
.B \-v
argument is used,
instead of points
the output will consist of
line segment data
suitable for input into
another invocation of
.IR cad_boundp\^ .
.P
Input lines not beginning with a number
are silently skipped.
This feature can be used to
accommodate comments or
additional control information
in the data stream.
.P
When a
.I tolerance\^
is specified,
a point is considered to be identical
to a previously-input point
if its
.I x\^
and
.I y\^
coordinates are both within
.I tolerance\^
of the first point encountered
within a group passing the tolerance test.
Otherwise,
point coordinates must match precisely
or the algorithm will produce
erroneous results.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.I cad_boundp\^
may output a polygon
smaller than desired
or produce a
``degenerate input''
message
if the
.I tolerance\^
is too tight
or if input is incomplete.
It may be wise to specify
double the expected
.IR tolerance\^ .
.P
Holes within the view
cannot be recognized.
.P
Silhouette thickness must everywhere exceed
.I tolerance\^
(no narrow necking-down)
or a portion of the silhouette
will be ``lost'';
in particular,
the view should not consist of
disjoint parts.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Any error condition causes
.I cad_boundp\^
to terminate
with non-zero exit status
after it prints an error message
on the standard error output.
.P
An illegal argument
or improperly formatted input
produces an appropriate message.
.P
If a vertex
having only one line segment
connected to it
is found on the perimeter,
.I cad_boundp\^
produces the message
``degenerate input''.
.P
If there is too much data for
.I cad_boundp\^
to handle,
the message
``out of memory''
is produced.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
