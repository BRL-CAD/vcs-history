.SH NAME
mged \- multi-display interactive combinatorial solid geometry editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mged
[-r] [-c] [-f] database.g [mged_command]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mged\^
interactively edits the specified database file
.I database.g
on any one of a number of display devices, including
any UNIX-plot device,
a Vector General 3300,
a Megatek 7250,
a Tektronix 4014 or compatable display,
a Tektronix 4109 or compatable display,
a Raster Technologies One/80,
an Evans and Sutherland Picture System 300,
a Silicon Graphics IRIS 2400 or 3030 workstation,
a Silicon Graphics IRIS 4D workstation,
or any workstation which supports the MIT X-Window System (X11).
.PP
For detailed documentation,
obtain a copy of
the guide ``\fIComputer Graphics for Target Descriptions\fR'',
BRL Technical Report ARBRL-TR-02480,
``\fIGED:  An Interactive
Solid Modeling System for Vulnerability Assessments\fR'',
or refer to the ``\fIUsers Manual for BRL-CAD Graphics Editor MGED\fR''
which is included in the full BRL-CAD manual set.
.SH HINTS
.I mged\^
database names conventionally end with
.BR .g .
.PP
SIGINT aborts the current command.
.PP
"q" or EOF exits the program.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS
$ \|\fImged \|tank.g\fP
.RE
.SH "STARTUP"
.I mged\^
may be run in one of three modes.
(a) single-shot command.  One command is given on the command line,
after the database name.
(b) multiple commands from a file.
The input is not from a terminal, but instead from a file or
shell-script ``here document''.
No display manager is attached to.
(c)  interactive mode.
.br
The ".mgedrc" file is processed and then either a multiple window
graphical user interface (GUI) is presented or the user is prompted
for which display manager they wish to attach to, with a question
like:
.br
  attach (nu|tek|tek4109|ps|plot|sgi|X)[nu]?
.PP
The ".mgedrc" file is searched for in three places.
The first one found is used, and any others are ignored.
(a) If the environment variable MGED_RCFILE is set, it is used
as a path name for the file to be used.
(b) If the environment variable HOME is set, then HOME/.mgedrc
is used.
(c) If the file ".mgedrc" exists in the current directory, it is used.
.PP
Whether or not mged presents a multiple window GUI depends on whether
or not it is running in "classic" mode.  By default, it will create a
multiple window GUI and automatically detach from the executing
terminal so it may run as a background process.
.SH MODES
The "set" command can be used to select various operating modes for
.I mged\^.
This is most useful in conjunction with the ".mgedrc" file, to
establish per-user preferences.
.br
  set autosize=0
.br
will defeat the automatic resizing of the view when the screen is empty.
.sp
  set sgi_win_size=1024
.br
  set sgi_win_origin=200,0
.br
can be used (\fIbefore\fR attaching to the SGI display manager) to
establish a preference for the size and location of the window to be opened.
.PP
The
.I -r
option to
.I mged
opens the database in a read-only mode.
.PP
The
.I -c
option to
.I mged
will run in "classic" mode.
.PP
The
.I -f
option to
.I mged
will prevent the application from automatically detaching and running
in the background.
.SH "X11 NOTES"
When using
.I mged\^
with the X11 display manager
(or the SGI display manager on an SGI 4D running IRIX 4.0),
be certain that the shell variable DISPLAY is set to indicate the host
that you wish to have your window opened on.
Failure to set the DISPLAY variable, or setting it improperly,
can cause bemusing error messages from the X window system.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
