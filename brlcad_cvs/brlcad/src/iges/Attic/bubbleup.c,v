/*	This routine finds union operators in the boolean tree
	that cannot be handled by BRL-CAD (due to BRLCAD's odd
	way of handling the union operator), and moves them
	toward the root of the tree.  To get the tree into
	a BRLCAD-acceptable format, no intersection or
	subtraction operators can be above any union operator
	in the tree.  Traverses the tree in LRN order.  Returns 1
	if no change was made to the tree, 0 otherwise.	*/
