.SH NAME
fbserv \- Frame-buffer Server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fbserv
[-h] [-s|S square_size] [-w|W width] [-n|N height] [-p port_number] [-F frame_buffer] [port_number] [frame_buffer]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fbserv
opens a framebuffer that may be used by any BRL-CAD routine accessing a framebuffer.
The
.B \-s or \-S
options specify that a square framebuffer of the specified size (in pixels) is desired. The
.B \-n or \-N
options may be used to indicated the height of the desired framebuffer.
The
.B \-w or \-W
options indicate the framebuffer width, and the
.B \-h
option indicates a 1024 X 1024 pixel framebuffer.
The
.B \-p
option supplies a port number and the
.B \-F
option indicates what framebuffer device to use.
The framebuffer device may be included on the command line without the
.B \-F
option if it is the last token on the command line. The port number may
also be specified without the
.B \-p
option. If both the
.B \-F and \-p
options are not used, the port number must be followed by the framebuffer
device on the command line. While
.I fbserv
is running, its port number may then be used in other commands
that access a framebuffer by supplying that port number with the
.B \-F
option for that command. The
.I fbserv
command may be executed by users at a shell prompt, or it may be used as
an inetd remote framebuffer server by specifying
.I fbserv
as a server program in
.B inetd.conf.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.ce
fbserv 0 &
.fi
This command will start a standalone fbserv daemon. Any access of a framebuffer
specifying port 0 will result in opening a new framebuffer.
.nf
.ce
fbserv -h 0 /dev/sgil &
.fi
The above command will open a 1024 X 1024 '/dev/sgil' framebuffer and associate port number 0
with it. Any access of a framebuffer specifying port 0 will use the already opened '/dev/sgil' framebuffer.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
