@gah, pick up where someone left off over half a decade ago.  finish updating all of the compat4 symbols throughout the code to their new names.  finally. it's done.  make the deprecated headers obsolete -- make compat4.h obsolete too so we can be sure that all of the changes are now picked up by the compiler as errors.  this change will likely impact muves if they've similarly not updated to the new names too, so the headers are kept with a #warning for now (though will likely disappear down the road entirely).

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
