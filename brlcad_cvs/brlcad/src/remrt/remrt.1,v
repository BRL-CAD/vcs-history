.SH NAME
remrt \- network distributed (remote) ray-trace dispatcher
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B remrt
[ options ... ]
model.g
objects ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I remrt
is intended to be an entirely plug-compatible replacement for
the
.IR rt (1)
program.
While
.I rt
can operate on more than one processor of a shared memory MIMD style
multi-processor, it can not spread the work out across the network.
.I remrt
and it's companion program
.IR rtsrv (1)
implement a
.IR libpkg (3)-based
protocol for distributing the task of ray-traced rendering out
to an arbitrary number of processors on the network.
Those processors can be from an arbitrary mix of vendors,
with differing instruction sets and data representations,
operating at widely different speeds.
.P
.I remrt
provides two levels of fault-tolerance in it's distributed computation.
First, any
.I rtsrv
processor which fails (or whose network link fails) will have it's work
reassigned automaticly by
.I remrt
to other processors, so that the failure of that processor does not
hold up the progress of the computation.
On a regular interval
.I remrt
attempts to restart computation on failed processors marked ``active'',
so that when failed systems become available again they are
put back to work.
Second,
.I remrt
offers a form of ``checkpoint-restart'' by carefully writing all
received pixel data immediately to disk.  If the machine running
.I remrt
should fail, when
.I remrt
is restarted, it will determine what work remains to be done and
restart all the
.I rtsrv
processes on the remote machines.
.P
.I remrt
takes exactly the same set of command line arguments as
.IR rt (1).
For a full discussion of those options, consult the
.IR rt (1)
manual page.
From within
.IR mged (1)
the
.I remrt
program can be run from the current
.I mged
view by giving the
.I mged
command
.sp .5
.ft B
     rrt remrt -M -s###
.ft R
.sp .5
where ``###'' is the image resolution desired.
.P
.I remrt
depends on the Berkeley
.I rsh (1)
remote shell command and the user's corresponding ``.rhosts'' file
to automaticly initiate remote computation.
.P
.I remrt
requires a control file called ``.remrtrc'' which specifies
a few essential parameters of the server machines (network hosts)
that are to participate in the distributed computation.
The ``.remrtrc'' file contains a list of normal
.I remrt
commands which are to be executed before distributed processing
is to begin.
This can be useful for establishing a variety of user-specific
defaults.
However, the most important command to provide is a ``host''
command to describe each of the remote hosts that will (or may)
participate in the distributed computation.
Here is a sample ``.remrt'' file:
.sp .5
.ft B
.in +5
.nf
host wolf	passive cd /tmp/cad/.remrt.4d
host voyage	always cd /tmp/cad/.remrt.4d
host whiz	hacknight convert /tmp
.fi
.in
.ft R
.sp .5
The first argument to the ``host'' command is the name of the
server machine.
It will be converted to a fully qualified name by calling
.IR gethostbyname (3)
and
.IR gethostbyaddr (3).
.P
The second argument to the ``host'' command describes ``when'' this
machine should be used.
.TP
.B always
says that whenever this host is not participating in the computation,
repeated attempts should be made (every 5 minutes) to start an
.I rtsrv
process on that machine.
This option is most useful for machines where the system administrator
and/or owner of the machine won't mind your using the machine at any
time.  (Note that
.I rtsrv
runs at the lowest priority by default, so this isn't too terribly
uncivilized.  But be polite and ask first.)
.TP
.B night
indicates that the machine should only be used during
the night and on weekends.
Night extends from 1800 through 0000 to 0800.
Saturday and Sunday are considered to be in night time for the entire day.
.TP
.B hacknight
indicates that the machine is owned by a late-night ``hacker'',
and can be used while that hacker is likely to be asleep.
Hacking tends to run from 1300 through 0000 to 0400, so
.B hacknight
is the time period from 0400 to 1300.
.TP
.B passive
indicates that
.I remrt
should never attempt to initiate an
.I rtsrv
process on this machine, but if the user should happen to start
.I rtsrv
manually on the machine and direct it to join the computational fray,
then the necessary information will be available.
.TP
If an unlisted machine should join the fray, it will be added
with a ``when'' value of
.B passive
and a ``where'' value of
.BR convert .
When an
.I rtsrv
passes from night into day, it is automaticly terminated by
.I remrt
at the appointed time.
.P
The third argument to the ``host'' command is the ``where'' parameter,
which indicates where the BRL-CAD ``.g'' file (and any related texture
maps) can be found.
.TP
.B cd
indicates that the
.I rtsrv
program should change directory
.IR cd (2)
to the indicated directory path, and should just read the
data files in that directory as
.I rt
normally would.
This can be used to specify NFS or RFS mounted remote directories,
or static copies of the binary database file(s) needed to perform
the ray-tracing.
This is the most efficient way of operating
.IR rtsrv ,
but it also requires some manual preparation on the part of the user
to install all the required files in the designated location.
.TP
.B convert
indicates that
.I remrt
should send across an ASCII machine-independent version of the
``.g'' database file using the command:
.sp .5
.ti +5
.ft B
asc2g < file.g | rsh host 'cd directory; g2asc > file.g'
.ft R
.sp .5
before starting up the
.I rtsrv
program in that same directory.
This relieves the user of the burden of setting up the ``.g''
database file, but suffers from several drawbacks.
First, the transmission of a large database can take a noticeable
amount of time.
Second, should the server host go down and then re-join the fray,
the database will be sent again, because
.I remrt
has no easy way to tell if the previous ``.g'' file is still intact
after the crash/restart.
Third,
.I remrt
has no way to tell what auxiliary files might be needed for this ``.g''
file, and thus can not send them automaticly.
If the ``.g'' file references height field, extruded bit-map, or volumetric
solids, the associated data files will not be present on a
.B convert
mode server.  The same applies for texture map and bump map files.
.P
.I remrt
uses several different strategies for optimizing the dispatching of work.
These can be controlled by the ``allocate'' command.
If the
.B \-I
(interactive) flag is given or ``allocate frame'' has been specified,
then the work allocation method is
a ``free for all'', allocating work from one frame at a time
to all servers as they become ready for more.
This maximizes the CPU overhead for prepping (because all CPUs will
prep all frames), but it also provides the shortest wall-clock time
to getting the first frame finished.
This mode is recommended for demonstrations, and other situations
where people are sitting around waiting for results to appear on the screen.
.P
If the
``allocate load'' command has been given, then new servers
will not be assigned to a given frame unless there is at least
enough work remaining on that frame to require
10 percent of that server's measured performance capacity.
Otherwise the server is started on a subsequent frame.
.P
If the ``allocate movie'' command is given, then each server is
allocated a whole frame to do.  This minimizes the CPU time
spent in the overhead of prepping the frame, and tends to maximize overall
throughput, at the price of making you wait a long time for the first
frame to finish.
This mode is best used when crunching out large numbers of frames
for an animation.
(See also the
.IR scriptsort (1)
command for a clever power-of-two script rearrangement technique first
proposed by Jim Blinn).
.P
The output can be stored either in a file, or sent to the current
framebuffer, the same as with
.IR rt (1).
.P
When
.I remrt
is run without command line arguments, it enters an interactive
mode.  In this mode, the current framebuffer can be assigned and
released, frames can be added to the list of pending work, and
many other control and status commands can be used.
.P
Normally
.I remrt
runs in a batch mode, taking all it's information from the
command line, the script file on stdin, and the ``.remrtrc'' file.
If you wish to issue an interactive-style command to
.I remrt
while it is running in batch mode, this can be accomplished by
giving an extra argument to
.IR rtsrv ,
which will simply pass on the command and exit.
For example:
.sp .5
.ft B
.ti +5
rtsrv server_host 4446 status
.ft R
.sp .5
would send the command ``status'' to the
.I remrt
process running on the machine called ``server_host'' and listening
at port 4446.
4446 is the port used by the first copy of
.I remrt
running on a machine.  If a second copy of
.I remrt
is started while the first one continues to run, it
will be assigned port 4447.  One is added to the port number
repeatedly until an available port is found.
Normally you do not need to worry about which port is being used,
unless you wish to send commands there directly.
The
.IR netstat (1)
command can sometimes be useful to track down which ports are being used.

.SH BUGS
Most deficiencies observed while using the
.B remrt
program are usually with the
.IR rt (1)
program, with which it shares a substantial amount of common code,
or with the
.IR librt (3)
library.
If a frame fails to render properly, try processing it on a single
machine using
.IR rt (1)
to determine if the problem is in the ray-tracing side of things,
or the distributed computation side of things.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
