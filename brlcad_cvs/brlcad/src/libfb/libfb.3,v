.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines are designed to provide a device-independent
method of using frame buffers or files containing frame buffer
images.
The coordinate system used is first-quadrant (0..width-1, 0..height-1),
with integer addressing.  Translation to hardware coordinate systems
is handled by the library.
.PP
This version of the library assumes that red, green, and blue
intensities are described by unsigned 8-bit bytes in the range (0..255).
The library interface uses arrays of
.BR RGBpixel s,
which is a typedef for an array of three unsigned chars (this was
done to avoid structure padding).  Note that a pointer to an
.B RGBpixel
is thus the name of the
.B RGBpixel
itself, i.e. no ampersand is needed.
.PP
The exact interpretation of color maps tends to be somewhat device
specific.
The three ColorMap arrays each have 256 entries of unsigned 16-bit values.
In order to accomodate color maps with differing amounts of output
resolution, the color map entries are fixed-point fractions
in the range (0.0..1.0).  In integer notation, the range is (0..65525).
For devices with less than 16 bits of output from their color maps,
the left-most portion of each entry is used.
.PP
.I Fb_open\^
is used to open a frame buffer file
.IR fbfile\^ .
The file may be either the name of a supported frame buffer interface,
referenced as "/dev/interface",
or the name of a UNIX file.
The routine will try to determine if the file opened was
a real frame buffer by examining the name,
and if so will perform
whatever initialization actions are necessary.
If the value of
.I fbfile\^
is
.B
.SM NULL
and the environment variable
.B
.SM FB_FILE
is set, then the value of
.SM FB_FILE
is used;
otherwise the default frame buffer device for the system is used.
See below for more details.
The
.I width\^
and
.I height\^
parameters specify the initial size of display desired.
If these are zero the default sizes for that device will be used.
On a successful open,
the frame buffer I/O (FBIO) structure pointer is returned.
This structure contains size you were actually given, as well
as the maximum possible size for the selected device.
A return of FBIO_NULL indicates failure.
.PP
.I Fb_close\^
simply closes the frame buffer.
.PP
.I Fb_read\^
reads
.I count\^
pixels from the frame buffer starting at the location specified by
.I x\^
and
.IR y\^ ,
and places them at program memory address specified
by
.IR addr\^ .
.I Fb_read\^
returns the number of pixels actually read, or -1 on error.
.PP
.I Fb_write\^
writes
.I count\^
pixels from program address
.I addr\^
into the frame buffer starting at the location
specified
by
.I x\^
and
.IR y\^ .
.I Fb_write\^
returns the number of pixels actually written, or
-1 on error.
.PP
.I Fb_rmap\^
reads in the color map from the frame buffer and
leaves at the location pointed to by
.IR cmap\^ .
.PP
.I Fb_wmap\^
writes the color map pointed to by
.I cmap\^
into the frame buffer.  If the value of
.I cmap\^
is
.B
.SM NULL
then a linear color map is used as the default.
.PP
.I Fb_clear\^
erases the frame buffer by setting all pixels to the given
color.
If the color pointer is NULL, black will be used.
On a UNIX file, this entails writing the entire file,
which is an expensive operation, whereas on most
frame buffer displays
this can be done in less than a second by a special command.
.PP
.I Fb_gettype\^
returns a pointer to a string describing the frame buffer
specified by the FBIO pointer.
.PP
.I Fb_getwidth\^
and
.I Fb_getheight\^
returns the current size of the FBIO frame buffer.
.PP
The following routines work in conjunction with those described above
to provide functions which only apply if the frame buffer
file is actually a hardware frame buffer display.
.PP
.I Fb_cursor\^
places the cursor at the image space coordinates given by
.I x\^
and
.IR y\^ .
If the mode is non-zero, the cursor is made visible, and
if mode is zero, the cursor is turned off.
.PP
.I Fb_scursor\^
is the same as
.I fb_cursor\^
except that it
places the cursor at the
.B screen
space coordinates given by
.I x\^
and
.IR y\^ .
.PP
.I Fb_setcursor\^
allows the user to set the bitmap used to represent the cursor,
thereby changing the cursor shape.
This is not necessarily supported
by all hardware.
The argument
.I bits\^
is a pointer to an array
of unsigned chars containing the bits of the cursor.
The arguments
.I xbits
and
.I ybits
specify the size of the cursor bitmap.  The number of bytes in the
.I bits
array will be the width rounded up to a mutiple of
eight (so that the cursor "scanlines" are byte aligned) times the
height.
.IR bits [0]
is the lower left corner,
.IR bits [1]
is to the right of it, etc.  The next line of the
.I bits
array goes above the current one.  Within a byte the most significant
bit is the leftmost.  The values
.I xorig
and
.I yorig
specify which bit in the bitmap actually gets placed at the location
specified in the cursor move routines.  Again, a first quadrant coordinate
system is used.
.PP
.I Fb_window\^
sets the frame buffer window center position to the image space coordinates
given by
.I x\^
and
.IR y\^ .
This command is usually used in conjunction with the
.I fb_zoom\^
routine.
.PP
.I Fb_zoom\^
sets the zoom factor for the X coordinate
to
.I x\^
and the zoom factor for the Y coordinate
to
.IR y\^ .
Zooming is generally done
by pixel replication in hardware.
.PP
The following routines work in conjunction with those described above
to provide buffered reading and writing of frame buffer images
either to a real frame buffer or a UNIX file.
The routines use a simple paging strategy to hold ``bands'' of
the image in core.
Since horizontal bands are buffered, the
ideal motion is to scan left to right, then bottom to top.
.PP
.I Fb_ioinit\^
should be called before using any of the other buffered I/O routines and
repeated whenever the frame buffer is reopened.
.PP
.I Fb_seek\^
is used to position the current read/write pointer to
the location to the next position to be read or written.
It is not necessary to do a
.I fb_seek\^
after every read or write since both
.I fb_rpixel\^
and
.I fb_wpixel\^
imply an automatic move to the next pixel.
If you read or write the last pixel on a scan line,
the pointer will automatically move to the beginning
of the following scan line.
.PP
.I Fb_tell\^
returns the current location of the read write pointer
in terms of (X,Y) coordinates on the frame buffer.
The X and Y values are returned into the integers pointed to
by
.I xp\^
and
.IR yp\^ .
.PP
.I Fb_rpixel\^
reads the pixel at the current frame buffer location
and returns it into the location specifed
by
.IR pixelp\^ .
.PP
.I Fb_wpixel\^
writes the pixel pointed to by
.I pixelp\^
at the current frame buffer location.
.PP
.I Fb_flush\^
caused any current buffered frame buffer pages to be written out.
Unnecessary writes are avoided by the use of page reference bits.
.PP
The following is a printing routine which this library uses to
indicate errors.
.PP
.I Fb_log\^
will convert, format and print its
.I args\^
under control of
.I format\^
to the standard error output.
For more detailed information on the specification of the control string,
see
.IR printf\^ (3S).
This function may be supplied by the application if different behavior
is desired.
.SH "FB_FILE DEVICES"
The following devices are supported by the library; not all may
be available on any given system.  New device support can be
incorporated by the addition of a single module to the library.
.TP
.BI /dev/debug [num]
The "/dev/debug" interface prints one line to logs each call
to the frame buffer library.
.br
.I num
is a bitvector indicating the levels of verbosity of the output.  See
.B fb.h
for the bit definitions.
.TP
.I filename
Disk file interface
.TP
.BI /dev/ik [num] [opt]
Adage RDS-3000 ("Ikonas")
.br
.I Num
indicates the device number.
.br
.I Opt
is a single character which indicates optional mode modification.
The letter ``v'' is to select NTSC video with internal sync.
The letter ``e'' is to select NTSC video with external sync.
The letter ``n'' is to select no frame-buffer controller (FBC) re-init
upon open;  the default is to reprogram the FBC on each open.
.TP
.BI /dev/sgi [num]
Silicon Graphics IRIS Workstation
.br
When the display is running the window-manager MEX, the default
is to open a window in 12-bit mode, with RGB converted to
a 10x10x10 color-cube approximation.
A non-zero
.I num
will select a dynamically allocated colormap, which is slower but sometimes of
higher quality.
When MEX is not running, the full 24-bits of color are used
on systems with that deep a display.
Regardless of mode, the full 24-bits of color are
stored in a shared memory segment, allowing it to be operated on in
the "frame buffer" in MEX mode without loss of color accuracy when
the image is read back.
To release the shared memory segment, open /dev/sgi99.
.TP
.B /dev/rat
RasterTek 1/80 (untested)
.B /dev/sun
Sun PixWin interface.  On monochrome displays, a dither pattern is used
to create the impression of shading.  On 8-bit color displays, a simple
3x3x2 color-cube approximation is used.  At present, there is no ability
to read back pixels from the Sun display, making it less useful for
serious image manipulation, but being able to ``brouse'' through
images even on a monochrome workstation makes this still a very
useful capability.
.TP
.BI hostname: [devicename]
TCP-based network links to a remote framebuffer, where
.I devicename
is any from this list, for example,
fictitious.brlcad.org:/dev/ik0 or fictitious.brlcad.org:/dev/sgi.
A
.B hostname
with a null
.I devicename
will select the default display device on that host.
If explicitly specifying a remote device,
be careful not to omit the colon between the host and device name,
or you will be specifying a local disk file as the result.
Note that for security reasons, it is not permitted to access a
disk file via the remote interface.
.SH EXAMPLE
.I Libfb\^
can be loaded with any
C
program:
.PP
.RS
$ \|\fI/bin/cc \|program.c \|-lfb -l\<system-library...\>\fP
.RE
.sp
where
.I <system-library>
denotes specific libraries necesary on a particular machine.  All machines
with networking will require the "-lpkg" option.  Machines which support the
X Windows(tm) system will require the "-lX11" option. In addition, the following
table lists architectures and libraries above and beyond the pkg and X11
libraries.

Vertical scanning will incur the most overhead, making it almost
impractical.
Due to the way memory is organized
in frame buffers and UNIX files, vertical scanning will never
be easy unless the image can be rotated.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
