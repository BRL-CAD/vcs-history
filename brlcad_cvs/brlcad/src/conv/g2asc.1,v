.SH NAME
g2asc,
asc2g \- convert between binary and ASCII \fBmged\fP geometry databases.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g2asc
file.g file.asc
.br
.B asc2g
file.asc file.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
The local machine binary representation
of an
.IR mged (1)
database is inherently non-portable.
.I g2asc
and
.I asc2g
are simple filters which convert between
the binary form and an ASCII representation.
Any warning messages are written to standard error.
.PP
The ASCII representation of BRL-CAD geometry databases is not a fixed
format and is allowed to change without deprecation notice.  In
general, this will not occur any more frequently than the binary
geometry database format changes, though both are open specifications.
Regardless, the ASCII representation is subject to change without
notice and should not be relied upon by external codes.  Currently,
the ASCII representation is a Tcl script that is parsed by a
simplified geometry command interpreter.
.PP
.I g2asc
and
.I asc2g
are typically used to convert binary
.IR mged (1)
files to an ASCII format.  This was traditionally performed so the
files could be transferred to another machine in a portable format.
Although no longer necessary for the current binary geometry database
files that are created by mged ("v5" format), the g2asc conversion
process is still necessary if manipulating older ("v4" format)
geometry database files.  On the local machine, files are converted to
ASCII using
.IR g2asc (1),
then transferred to the remote machine.  On the remote machine, the files
are then converted back to the binary representation for that machine using
.IR asc2g (1).
.SH EXAMPLE
.I
g2asc  file.g  file.asc
.br
scp file.asc remote:file.asc
.br
rsh remote "asc2g  file.asc  file.g"
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics are intended to be self-explanatory.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@update the manpage with more up-to-date information and details.  mention that current format is a tcl script, that the conversion to ascii isn't strictly necessary any longer since v5 format is portable, and that the ascii format should not be used by external codes.
