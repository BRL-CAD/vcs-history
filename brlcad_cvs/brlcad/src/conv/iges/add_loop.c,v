@whoosh, another 10% complete on the bu_bomb to bu_exit conversion review.  also includes a slew of custom exit() calls that can use bu_exit() as well as toning down a slew of overzealous exclamation point use.  (20% complete overall)

@rt_bomb() has been deprecated since before 7.0, but even our sources weren't properly updated to reflect this change.  update all of our sources to use bu_bomb() now.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
