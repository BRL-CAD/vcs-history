.SH NAME
iges-g \- IGES Translator (IGES CSG to BRL-CAD)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iges-g
[-X NMG_debug_flag] [-x rt_debug_flag] [-N solid_name] [-b] [-n|d|3|t] -o database.g file.iges
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I iges-g\^
converts the specified
.I file.iges
to a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file. The IGES file is expected to conform to IGES 5.1.
The
.I -n
option specifies that all rational B-spline surfaces in the IGES file should be
combined into one BRL-CAD spline solid.
The
.I -d
option indicates that IGES drawings should be converted to BRL-CAD NMG objects.
Theses objects will be two-dimensional drawings, not solids.
The
.I -3
option is the same as the
.I -d
option except the final projection into 2D is not performed. This may produce 3D drawings
in cases where the drawings have been produced from a 3D model.
The
.I -t
option requests all the trimmed surfaces in the IGES file be converted to
a single BRL-CAD NMG solid.
The
.I -N
option provides a name to be used for the single solid created under the
.I -n
or
.I -t
options, and is ignored for other options.
The
.I -p
option indicates that BREP objects should be converted to NMG solids rather than the default BOT solids.
The
.I -X
and
.I -x
options allow the setting of debug flags for the NMG routines and the rt library
respectively. See
.I nmg.h
and
.I debug.h
for details.
The
.I -b
option indicates that BREP solids should be written to the BRL-CAD model as NMG solids rather than
the default BOT solids.
The absence of any of the
.I -n
,
.I -d
, or
.I -t
options results in the default behavior where
all IGES CSG and planar face BREP objects are converted to BRL-CAD
equivalents. Most conversions are exact, with the exceptions of the solid of
revolution and the solid of linear extrusion. These solids do not exist in BRL-CAD
and are therefore approximated. The solid of revolution is built from a series of
truncated right cones developed by approximating the curve to be revolved with a series
of straight line segments. The extrusion is similarly handled by approximating the
curve to be extruded with straight line segments and using that to build a BRL-CAD
.I polysolid.
Planar faced IGES BREP objects are converted to BRL-CAD NMG structures.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
