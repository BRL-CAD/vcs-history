.SH NAME
dbupgrade \(em a program to upgrade BRL-CAD \fBmged\fR geometry databases files to the current version.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbupgrade
input.g
output.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dbupgrade
operates on the indicated input geometry database
.I input.g
recognizing the version of the BRL-CAD database provided as input and
then converting it to the current database version.  Output is then saved to the specified
.I output.g
file.
.LP
Note that this tool does not automatically ``fix'' an existing (v4
format) binary database that was transferred from a
binary-incompatible platform.  However, if you run
.B dbupgrade
on the file before transferring from that platform, the upgraded
output file will be platform independent.
.PP
Running
.B dbupgrade
removes the need to run
.IR g2asc (1)
and
.IR asc2g (1)
on a database.  The latest BRL-CAD geometry database format is
platform independent.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
mged(1), g2asc(1), asc2g(1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Numerous error conditions are possible, usually due to errors in
the geometry database.
Descriptive messages are printed on standard error (file descriptor 2).

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
