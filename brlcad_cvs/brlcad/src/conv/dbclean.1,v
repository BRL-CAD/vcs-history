.SH NAME
dbclean \(em a shell script for compacting \fBmged\fR databases.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbclean
in_model.g
out_model.g
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dbclean
operates on the indicated input database
.I in_model.g
and produces a compacter version of the same
.I out_model.g.
.LP
The objective is to remove ``holes" left in the original database by using
the \fIkill/killall\fR command in
.IR mged (1).
Note that when a database is compacted in this manner, the compacting is
dependent on the successful completion of the converters
.IR g2asc (1)
and
.IR asc2g (1).
The compacting will only be aborted if one of the conversions fails.  Thus,
when either converter ``skips" solids, \fBdbclean\fR will continue, and
.I out_model.g
will be written, albeit, without the skipped solids.  This will also
result in a smaller database.
.SH EXAMPLE
This section will acquaint the user with the ordinary usage of \fIdbclean\fR.

.nf
.ce
\fIdbclean in_model.g out_model.g\fR
.fi

This will result in a compacted version of the input.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
mged(1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Numerous error conditions are possible, usually due to errors in
the geometry database.
Descriptive messages are printed on standard error (file descriptor 2).

.SH BUGS
.LP
Most deficiencies observed while using the
.B dbclean
program are usually with the
.IR g2asc (1)
and
.IR asc2g (1)
packages instead.
.SH "BUG REPORTS"
Reports of bugs or problems should be submitted via electronic

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
