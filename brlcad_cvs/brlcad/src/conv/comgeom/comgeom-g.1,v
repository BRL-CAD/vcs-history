.SH NAME
comgeom-g \- convert GIFT COMGEOM model into MGED database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B comgeom-g
.RB [ \-d\  debug_lvl]
.RB [ \-v\  version_num]
.RB [ \-s\  name_suffix]
file.cg file.g
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Read a COMGEOM version 4 or version 5 format model from
a GIFT-style input file, convert the geometry into
the internal form used by the BRL-CAD package,
and write an MGED-style binary database.
.PP
Each solid is given the name ``s###'', retaining the COMGEOM solid number.
Each region is given the name ``r###'', retaining the COMGEOM region number.
Regions are grouped together into various groups ``g###'' based
on the region-id numbers.  Group ``g00'' gets all regions with region-id
of zero, ``g0'' gets ids one through 99, ``g1'' gets ids 100 through 199, etc.
.PP
The default input is COMGEOM version 5.
Version 4 can be converted by specifying the
.B \-v4
flag.
For the time being, the DoE MORSE/RAFFLE format (believed to be the
original MAGIC format) can be converted by specifying the
.B \-v1
flag.
.PP
By default, the program
.I comgeom-g
operates silently.
Because the program may require a minute or two to convert a large
database, some users prefer to have various status reports that
indicate the progress of the conversion.
This can be selected by specifying the
.B \-d1
flag (debug level 1).
.PP
The units used in a COMGEOM file are specified on a header record.
The units of an MGED database are always milimeters.
.I comgeom-g
performs automatic units conversion using the built-in units conversion
feature of
\fIlibwdb\fR(3).
.SH EXAMPLE
.I
comgeom-g < file.cg > file.g
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics are intended to be self-explanatory.
Familiarity with GIFT COMGEOM terminology will be helpful.
.SH BUGS
It is expected that the input file should be a valid COMGEOM model.
While quite a bit of input checking is performed, wildly incorrect
input may produce amusing results.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
