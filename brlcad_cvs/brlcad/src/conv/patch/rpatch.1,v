.SH NAME
rpatch \- convert FASTGEN ASCII databases into a format suitable for
.I patch-g.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I rpatch
[-D] [-3] < FASTGEN_FILE > OUTPUT_FILE
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program reformats FASTGEN files to a form usable by
.I patch-g.
The
.I -D
option handles type 3 components as donuts rather than triangles. The
.I -3
option reads FASTGEN3 format files (coordinates are each 10 columns wide).
.SH EXAMPLE
.I
rpatch < fastgen_file > file.rpatch
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics are intended to be self-explanatory.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
