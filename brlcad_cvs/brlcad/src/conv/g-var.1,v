.SH NAME
g-var \- Produce (OpenGL) Vertex Arrays from BOT BRL-CAD geometry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-var
[-v] [-y] [-s scale] [-f] [-o outfile] infile.g object
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-var
writes the bag of triangle (BOT) primitives of the specified
.I object
in a binary array format to
.I outfile
or to
.I stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Request verbose output.
.TP
.B \-y
Transform the coordinate system from xyz to xzy.
.TP
.B \-s scale
Scale the output geometry by factor
.B scale
\. By default the scale factor is 0.001 (standard transformation
from meters to millimeters.)
.TP
.B \-f
Flip face normals. This changes both the vertex order and the output normals.
.TP
.B \-o outfile
The output will be written to
.B outfile
\. By default the output is written to stdout.
.SH FILE FORMAT
.I TODO
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS
$ \|\fIg-var \|-o sample.mesh \|sample.g \|sample_object\fP
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
