.SH NAME
g-nmg \- Perform Boolean evaluations to produce NMG objects
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-nmg
[-v] [-b] [-t calc_dist_tol] [-a abs_tess_tol] [-n norm_tess_tol] [-r rel_tess_tol]
[-o outfile.g] infile.g object(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-nmg
performs the Boolean operations in the specified
.I object(s)
and writes the resulting NMG primitives (or BOT primitives, if the
.I
-b
option is specified) to
.I outfile.g
or to
.I stdout
if the
.I -o
option is not used.

The following options are available:
.TP
.B \-a abs_tess_tol
Specify an absolute tessellation tolerance (in millimeters).
This requires that the maximum absolute error from the tessellated surface to the actual
surface must not be greater than
.I abs_tess_tol.
.TP
.B \-b
Convert the results to a BOT primitive (triangle representation) instead of leaving it as an NMG.
.TP
.B \-n norm_tess_tol
Specify a surface normal error tolerance (in degrees) for the tessellation.
.TP
.B \-o outfile.g
Specify the name of the file to be created.  This should not be the same as the input file.
.TP
.B \-r rel_tess_tol
Specify a relative error tolerance. This effectively
sets an absolute tolerance for each primitive solid by multiplying the
overall size of the solid by
.I rel_tess_tol.
This allows small objects to be tessellated with small tolerances, while large objects are tessellated with large tolerances.
For example, specifying
.I \-r 0.1
when tesselating an object 2m in size, will result in a tolerance of .2m (2.0 * 0.1).
The same option will cause a 5cm object to be tesselated with a tolerance of 0.5cm.
.TP
.B \-t calc_dist_tol
Specify a calculational distance tolerance (in millimeters).
This tolerance is used to distinguish neighboring vertices.
Any two vertices less than this tolerance distance apart will be considered the same vertex.
The default value is 0.005mm.
Prior to performing the Boolean operations for each region, the involved primitive solids
are converted to a planar facetted approximation and stored as NMG solids. This tessellation
can be controlled using the tessellation tolerances.
.TP
.B \-v
Produce copious progress information.
.TP
.B \-x
Set librt debug flags.
The definitions of these flags may be found in
.I librt/debug.h
.TP
.B \-X
Set NMG routines debug flags.
The definitions of these flags may be found in
.I h/nmg.h.
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS
$ \|\fIg-nmg \|-o shell.g \|sample.g \|sample_object\fP
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.
.SH BUGS
Boolean operations under finite precision arithmetic are not guaranteed to be solvable.  As a result this command can fail.  Scaling geometry adjusting tolerance values, and restructuring the boolean tree will often result in a successful tesselation.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
