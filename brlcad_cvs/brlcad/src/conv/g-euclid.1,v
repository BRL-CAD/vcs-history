.SH NAME
g-euclid \- EUCLID Translator (BRL-CAD to EUCLID)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-euclid [-v] [-xX lvl]
[-a abs_tol] [-r rel_tol] [-n norm_tol] [-o euclid_file] database.g object(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-euclid\^
converts the specified
.I object(s)
from a BRL-CAD
.I database.g
file to the "decoded"
.I EUCLID
format.
The decoded file represents each object as a series
of polygonal faces. Each face may be one of either a simple face (no holes),
a complex face (contains at least one hole), or a simple hole.
This converter creates a region for each object ID number by unioning
together all the objects with the same ID number. The
.I -x
option specifies an RT debug flag and the
.I -X
option specifies an NMG debug flag. The
.I -a
,
.I -r
, and
.I -n
options specifiy tesselation tolerances. The
.I -o
option specifies the mame of the file to receive the output
(stdout is the default).
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS
$ \|\fIg-euclid \|-o sample.euclid \|sample.g \|sample_object\fP
.RE
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
