.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These subroutines
generate
graphic output commands for processing
with the
.B plot(1)
plotting filters.
They are slightly more general than those in
.B libplot
as these take a file pointer.   They also include
the BRL 3-D extensions to the plot intermediate code.
.PP
.I Pl_space\^
or
.I pl_3space\^
must be used before any of the graphic primitives to declare the
amount of space necessary.
See
.IR plot3(5) .
.PP
.I Pl_box\^
or
.I pl_3box\^
draws a box between the two given opposite points.
The ''pen'' will be left at the second point.
.PP
.I Pl_circle\^
draws a circle of radius
.I r\^
with center at the point
.RI ( x ,
.IR y ).
Note that
.I circle
and
.I arc
cannot be transformed in three space if one is using a
filter to do that.
.PP
.I Pl_arc\^
draws an arc of a circle with center at the point
.RI ( x ,
.IR y )
between the points
.RI ( x0 ,
.IR y0 )
and
.RI ( x1 ,
.IR y1 ).
.PP
String arguments to
.I pl_label\^
and
.I pl_linmod\^
are terminated by nulls and do not contain new-lines.
.PP
There are also 2-D and 3_D double-precision versions, with arguments
identical to their counterparts above.  The naming conventions are to
change the prefix to ``pd''; examples are thus
.I pd_point\^
and
.I pd_3point\^.
Vector versions for 3_D (also double-precision) are prefixed ``pdv'', as in
.I pdv_3point\^.
.PP
See
.I plot3(5)
and
.I plot(5)
for a description
of the effect of the remaining functions.
.PP
.SH FILES
/usr/brlcad/lib/libplot3\f3.\fPa	produces output for
.IR plot\^ (1G)
filters
.br
.SH WARNINGS
In order to compile a program containing these functions
in
.I file.c\^
it is necessary to use
``cc
.I file.c\^
\-lplot3''.
.PP
.I Color\^
specification and
three-dimensional primitives
are BRL extensions to the "unix plot" language
that are not generally found on other systems.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
