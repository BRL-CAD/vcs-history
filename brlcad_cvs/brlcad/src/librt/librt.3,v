.SH DESCRIPTION
.I rt_dirbuild\^
opens
.I mged_file_name
and builds a directory for quick lookup of objects.
.I rt_dirbuild\^
returns a pointer to a
.I "struct rt_i"
on success (often called ``\fIrtip\fP''),
or
.I RTI_NULL
on failure (such as being unable to open the named database).
This pointer must be saved, as it is a required parameter to
.IR rt_gettree .
The user-supplied buffer
.I buf\^
is filled with up to
.I len
characters
of information from the first title record in the database.
If it is desired for ``air'' objects to be reported as ``hits''
during ray-tracing, then the
.I useair
member of the
.I "struct rt_i"
must be set before the first call to
.IR rt_gettree .
.P
All objects (groups and regions) which are to be included in the description
to be raytraced must be preprocessed with
.IR rt_gettree ,
which returns \-1 for failure and 0 for success.
This function can be called as many times as required.
Be certain to pass the
.I "struct rt_i"
pointer from
.I rt_dirbuild\^
each time.
.P
After the last
.I rt_gettree
call,
.I rt_prep
can be called to complete the preparation of internal data structures.
If
.I rt_prep
is not explicitly called, it will be indirectly invoked by the first use of
.IR rt_shootray .
.P
To fire a ray at the model, an
.I application
structure must be
prepared and its address passed to
.IR rt_shootray .
Note that it is mandatory that you provide values for
.I a_ray.r_pt
(the starting point of the ray to be fired),
.I a_ray.r_dir
(a unit-length direction vector),
.I a_hit
(address of user-supplied hit routine),
.I a_miss
(address of user-supplied miss routine),
.I a_overlap
(address of user-supplied overlap routine; may be null),
.I a_rt_i
(\fIstruct rt_i\fP pointer, from
.IR rt_dirbuild ),
.I a_onehit
(flag controlling stop after first hit),
.I a_level\^
(recursion level, just for diagnostic printing),
and
.I a_resource
(address of
.I resource
structure; may be null).
.P
To obtain a report of CPU usage for a portion or portions of your program,
frame the statements with calls to
.I rt_prep_timer
and
.IR rt_read_timer .
Each call to
.I rt_prep_timer
resets the timing process, after which
.I rt_read_timer
can be called to get
a double which is the elapsed CPU time in seconds since
.I rt_prep_timer
was last called.
In addition, up to
.I len
bytes of
system-specific detailing of resource consumption
is placed in the user-supplied buffer
.IR buf .
.P
.I bu_bomb
can be used to exit your program with
.I msg
printed on the standard error output.
.SH WARNING
.I Librt
is designed to run in parallel on some multiprocessor machines.
On some such machines
system calls must be semaphore protected.
.P
Dynamic memory handling in applications using
.I librt
should use
the functions provided by
.I libbu
instead of the usual system runtime library
routines.  The
.I libbu
versions do not return to the caller unless they succeed.  If they fail,
they call
.I bu_bomb
with their last argument (str) as the parameter.  The string parameter
usually indicates the purpose of the memory being allocated.
.P
.SH "EXIT CODE"
All truly fatal errors detected by the library use
.I bu_bomb
to exit with a status of 12.
.SH DEFINITION
RPP \- Rectangular ParallelePiped.
A region of space defined by minimum and maximum values in X, Y, and Z.
RPPs are used by
.I librt
as bounding volumes for solids.
.SH DISCUSSION
You should study the structures in
.IR raytrace.h ,
in particular, the
.I application
structure,
the
.I partition
structure and its component structures to get an idea of what information
is handed to/from
.IR rt_shootray .
.I rt_shootray
may be called recursively from your
.I a_hit
routine (good for doing bounced rays).
If you only care about the first
object hit along the path of the ray, set the
.I a_onehit
flag in the application structure before calling
.IR rt_shootray .
.I rt_shootray
returns the return value of the user-supplied hit or miss function
that it called.
.P
If the ray intersects the model, the
.I a_hit
routine is called
with a pointer to the application structure and a pointer to a
linked list of ray partitions
(\fIstruct partition\fP).
Within each partition are
.I seg
(solid segment)
and
.I hit
(intersection with evaluated region)
structure pointers
for the places where the ray enters and leaves this partition of space.
.I pt_inhit.hit_dist
is the parametric distance at which the ray enters
the partition, and
.I pt_outhit.hit_dist
is the parametric distance at which the ray leaves.
Note that while the
.I hit
structure contains
.I hit_point
and
.I hit_norm
elements, they are not computed by
.IR rt_shootray .
If these are needed, they can be filled in by using the
.I RT_HIT_NORM\^
macro;
if surface curvature information is needed,
it can be obtained by using the
.I RT_CURVE\^
macro after
.IR RT_HIT_NORM ;
if only the
.I hit_point
is needed,
it can be filled in by using the
.I VJOIN1\^
macro (see the following example).
.P
If the ray contains any overlaps
(partitions claimed by two or more regions) the
.I a_overlap
routine is called for each such partition
with pointers to the application structure,
the overlap partition,
two regions,
and the remaining partitions along the ray.
If the
.I a_overlap
member is null,
.I librt
uses a default overlap handler.
Additionally,
.I librt
provides the routine
.P
If the ray does not intersect the model, the
.I a_miss
routine is called
with a pointer to the application structure.
.P
Helpful in generating a grid of ray origins, the bounding RPP of the
model is computed by
.I rt_gettree
and is stored in
.I rtip\->mdl_min
and
.IR rtip\->mdl_max .
.SH EXAMPLE

mged(1B), rt(1B).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
``rt_malloc: malloc failure'',
if
.I librt
is unable to allocate memory with
.IR malloc .
``rt_\fI???\fP: read error'', if an error or EOF occurs while
reading from the model database.
``unexpected SIGFPE!'' when a floating point error occurs.
(The rootfinder traps SIGFPE, but SIGFPE elsewhere is unexpected.)
``rt_shootray: zero length dir vector'' when the
.I a_ray.r_dir
vector is not unit length.
``rt_gettree called again after rt_prep!'' when an attempt is made
to add more sub-trees to the active model after calling
.I rt_prep
(or after firing the first ray).
``rt_prep: re-invocation'' when
.I rt_prep
is called more than once.
``rt_prep: no solids to prep'' when there are no valid solids
in the model.
.SH AUTHOR(S)
Michael John Muuss
.SH BUGS
On a VAX, the rootfinder detects ``hard'' cases by taking a SIGFPE
and retrying
with a slower but more stable algorithm.
This is unfortunate.

@gah, pick up where someone left off over half a decade ago.  finish updating all of the compat4 symbols throughout the code to their new names.  finally. it's done.  make the deprecated headers obsolete -- make compat4.h obsolete too so we can be sure that all of the changes are now picked up by the compiler as errors.  this change will likely impact muves if they've similarly not updated to the new names too, so the headers are kept with a #warning for now (though will likely disappear down the road entirely).

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
