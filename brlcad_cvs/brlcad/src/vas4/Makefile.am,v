@restructure library linkages so that brl-cad libraries no longer list their dependencies as a LIBADD.  dependencies are moved into configure.ac and provided via _LIBS variables so that they are specified at link time.  this supports hybrid static library compilation as well as other more varied mixture configurations.  use the new _LIBS variables throughout.  probably want to re-combine them later into a single symbol name per library but this will suffice for now.

@whoosh! push BU, BN, and RT (and maybe one or two others) out of library LIBADD declarations down to application LDADD linkage.  this means that there might be issues to solve again towards being able to generate fully contained/resolved libraries (e.g. frameworks), but solves the current problem of linking against static tcl/tk libraries portably.  duplicate symbols become a problem at link time (bu, bn, and rt all use tcl).  pushing the link specification all the way down to the binary (so far) makes everyone happy.

@*yawn* remove one of the big two remaining public header sets from our include/ directory.  remove tcl headers from include/ and utilize the TCL_CPPFLAGS so compilation pulls headers from within src/other/libtcl instead.  since bu.h and raytrace.h include tcl foo, this implicates a change across almost the entire build to add the new CPPFLAGS.

@convert all of the lingering getopt calls to bu_getopt (as well as the related getopt globals optind, opterr, optarg) -- libbu's getopt has the benefit of being re-entrant and is portable to environments where getopt() may not be available.

@Major restructuring and fixes so that 'make distcheck' should now work and actually be close to correct.  i.e. the resultant generated tarball should contain contents similar to a CVS export.  This helps it generate a proper distribution and build, install, and uninstall cleanly off of that distribution.
