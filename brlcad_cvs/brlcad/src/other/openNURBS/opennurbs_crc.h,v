Description:
  Continues 16 bit CRC calulation to include the buffer.

Parameters:
  current_remainder - [in]
  sizeof_buffer - [in]  number of bytes in buffer
  buffer - [in]

Example:
  16 bit CRC calculations are typically done something like this:

          const ON__UINT16 crc_seed = 0; // or 1, or your favorite starting value

          // Compute CRC on "good" data
          unsigned ON__UINT16 first_crc = crc_seed;
          first_crc = ON_CRC16( first_crc, size1, buffer1 );
          ...
          first_crc = ON_CRC16( first_crc, sizeN, bufferN );
          unsigned char two_zero_bytes[2] = (0,0);
          first_crc = ON_CRC16( first_crc, 2, two_zero_bytes );

          // make sure 16 bit CRC calculation is valid
          ON__UINT16 check_crc_calculation = ON_CRC16( first_crc, 2, &first_crc );
          if ( check_crc_calculation != 0 )
          {
             printf("ON_CRC16() calculated a bogus 16 bit CRC\n");
          }

          // Do something that may potentially change the values in
          // the buffers (like storing them on a faulty disk).

          // Compute CRC on "suspect" data
          ON__UINT16 second_crc = crc_seed;
          second_crc = ON_CRC16( second_crc, size1, buffer1 );
          ...
          second_crc = ON_CRC16( second_crc, sizeN, bufferN );
          if ( 0 != ON_CRC16( second_crc, 2, &first_crc ) )
          {
            printf( "The value of at least one byte has changed.\n" );

Description:
  Continues 32 bit CRC calulation to include the buffer

  ON_CRC32() is a slightly altered version of zlib 1.3.3's crc32()
  and the zlib "legal stuff" is reproduced below.

  ON_CRC32() and zlib's crc32() compute the same values.  ON_CRC32()
  was renamed so it wouldn't clash with the other crc32()'s that are
  out there and the argument order was switched to match that used by
  the legacy ON_CRC16().

Parameters:
  current_remainder - [in]
  sizeof_buffer - [in]  number of bytes in buffer
  buffer - [in]

Example:
  32 bit CRC calculations are typically done something like this:

          const ON__UINT32 crc_seed = 0; // or 1, or your favorite starting value

          //Compute CRC on "good" data
          ON__UINT32 first_crc = crc_seed;
          first_crc = ON_CRC32( first_crc, size1, buffer1 );
          ...
          first_crc = ON_CRC32( first_crc, sizeN, bufferN );

          // Do something that may potentially change the values in
          // the buffers (like storing them on a faulty disk).

          // Compute CRC on "suspect" data
          ON__UINT32 second_crc = crc_seed;
          second_crc = ON_CRC32( second_crc, size1, buffer1 );
          ...
          second_crc = ON_CRC32( second_crc, sizeN, bufferN );
          if ( second_crc != first_crc )
          {
            printf( "The value of at least one byte has changed.\n" );
          }

1.1
log
@initial import of the openNURBS initiative's nurbs toolkit.  the toolkit consists of code for reading/writing .3dm files used by Rhino as well as nurbs evaluation and other geometry processing facilities.  the library is being evaluated for .3dm support as well as potentially gutting the existing nurbs primitive and using openNURBS evaluation routines instead (still probably need to implement ray shot evaluation).  this is version 200612050 (aka 4.0).

this is also a C++ library, the first integration of an external C++ dependency into BRL-CAD.  additional support/infrastructure will be needed to support this in configure.  there's still, however, a policy/convention of "containment" so that C++ does not propagate into the existing BRL-CAD libraries.  any additions that utilize c++ still have to be entirely modular (and optional) for the time being.
