1.2
log
@revert the NetBSD libtermcap library.  there are too many dependency woes (getcap, db, fgetln, strlcpy) to make it work cleanly without bringing in all of db too.  it was only working well under the osx/bsd's because everything happened to be available.

1.1
log
@update from the old vi termcap sources to the more modern NetBSD implementation.  this version doesn't suffer the assumption that there needs to be an /etc/termcap among many other improvements.  it's under 3-clause BSD and seems to be version 0.6 dated December 17, 2006.
