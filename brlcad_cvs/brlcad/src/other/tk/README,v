1. Introduction
---------------

This directory contains the sources and documentation for Tk, an X11
toolkit implemented with the Tcl scripting language.

For details on features, incompatibilities, and potential problems with
this release, see the Tcl/Tk 8.5 Web page at

	http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.5.html

or refer to the "changes" file in this directory, which contains a
historical record of all changes to Tk.

Tk is maintained, enhanced, and distributed freely by members of the
Tcl community.  The home for Tcl/Tk sources and bug database is on
SourceForge at:

	http://tcl.sourceforge.net/

with the Tcl Developer Xchange at:

	http://www.tcl.tk/

Tk is a freely available open source package.  You can do virtually
anything you like with it, such as modifying it, redistributing it,
and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the file
"license.terms" for complete information.

2. See Tcl README
-----------------

Please see the README file that comes with the associated Tcl release
for more information.  There are pointers there to extensive
documentation.  In addition, there are additional README files
in the subdirectories of this distribution.

1.1
log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
