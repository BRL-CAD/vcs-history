 * In order to find tk.tcl during initialization, the following script is
 * invoked by Tk_Init(). It looks in several different directories:
 *
 *	$tk_library		- can specify a primary location, if set no
 *				  other locations will be checked
 *
 *	$env(TK_LIBRARY)	- highest priority so user can always override
 *				  the search path unless the application has
 *				  specified an exact directory above
 *
 *	$tcl_library/../tk$tk_version
 *				- look relative to init.tcl in an installed
 *				  lib directory (e.g. /usr/local)
 *
 *	<executable directory>/../lib/tk$tk_version
 *				- look for a lib/tk<ver> in a sibling of the
 *				  bin directory (e.g. /usr/local)
 *
 *	<executable directory>/../library
 *				- look in Tk build directory
 *
 *	<executable directory>/../../tk$tk_patchLevel/library
 *				- look for Tk build directory relative to a
 *				  parallel build directory
 *
 * The first directory on this path that contains a valid tk.tcl script will
 * be set ast the value of tk_library.
 *
 * Note that this entire search mechanism can be bypassed by defining an
 * alternate tkInit procedure before calling Tk_Init().

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
