# ::tk_optionMenu --
# This procedure creates an option button named $w and an associated
# menu.  Together they provide the functionality of Motif option menus:
# they can be used to select one of many values, and the current value
# appears in the global variable varName, as well as in the text of
# the option menubutton.  The name of the menu is returned as the
# procedure's result, so that the caller can use it to change configuration
# options on the menu or otherwise manipulate it.
#
# Arguments:
# w -			The name to use for the menubutton.
# varName -		Global variable to hold the currently selected value.
# firstValue -		First of legal values for option (must be >= 1).
# args -		Any number of additional values.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
