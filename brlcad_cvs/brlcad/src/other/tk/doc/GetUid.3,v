.SH NAME
Tk_GetUid, Tk_Uid \- convert from string to unique identifier
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
Tk_Uid
\fBTk_GetUid\fR(\fIstring\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AP char *string in
String for which the corresponding unique identifier is
desired.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_GetUid\fR returns the unique identifier corresponding
to \fIstring\fR.
Unique identifiers are similar to atoms in Lisp, and are used
in Tk to speed up comparisons and
searches.  A unique identifier (type Tk_Uid) is a string pointer
and may be used anywhere that a variable of type ``char *''
could be used.  However, there is guaranteed to be exactly
one unique identifier for any given string value.  If \fBTk_GetUid\fR
is called twice, once with string \fIa\fR and once with string
\fIb\fR, and if \fIa\fR and \fIb\fR have the same string value
(strcmp(a, b) == 0), then \fBTk_GetUid\fR will return exactly
the same Tk_Uid value for each call (Tk_GetUid(a) == Tk_GetUid(b)).
This means that variables of type
Tk_Uid may be compared directly (x == y) without having to call
\fBstrcmp\fR.
In addition, the return value from \fBTk_GetUid\fR will have the
same string value as its argument (strcmp(Tk_GetUid(a), a) == 0).

.SH KEYWORDS
atom, unique identifier

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
