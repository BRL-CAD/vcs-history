.SH NAME
Tk_GetVRootGeometry \- Get location and size of virtual root for window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_GetVRootGeometry(\fItkwin, xPtr, yPtr, widthPtr, heightPtr\fB)\fR
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window heightPtr
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window whose virtual root is to be queried.
.AP int xPtr out
Points to word in which to store x-offset of virtual root.
.AP int yPtr out
Points to word in which to store y-offset of virtual root.
.AP "int" widthPtr out
Points to word in which to store width of virtual root.
.AP "int" heightPtr out
Points to word in which to store height of virtual root.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_GetVRootGeometry\fR returns geometry information about the virtual
root window associated with \fItkwin\fR.  The ``associated'' virtual
root is the one in which \fItkwin\fR's nearest top-level ancestor (or
\fItkwin\fR itself if it is a top-level window) has
been reparented by the window manager.  This window is identified by
a \fB__SWM_ROOT\fR or \fB__WM_ROOT\fR property placed on the top-level
window by the window manager.
If \fItkwin\fR is not associated with a virtual root (e.g.
because the window manager doesn't use virtual roots) then *\fIxPtr\fR and
*\fIyPtr\fR will be set to 0 and *\fIwidthPtr\fR and *\fIheightPtr\fR
will be set to the dimensions of the screen containing \fItkwin\fR.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
