.SH NAME
tk_chooseDirectory \- pops up a dialog box for the user to select a directory.
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtk_chooseDirectory \fR?\fIoption value ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The procedure \fBtk_chooseDirectory\fR pops up a dialog box for the
user to select a directory. The following \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are
possible as command line arguments:
.TP
\fB\-initialdir\fR \fIdirname\fR
Specifies that the directories in \fIdirectory\fR should be displayed
when the dialog pops up. If this parameter is not specified, then
the directories in the current working directory are displayed. If the
parameter specifies a relative path, the return value will convert the
relative path to an absolute path.  This option may not always work on
the Macintosh.  This is not a bug. Rather, the \fIGeneral Controls\fR
control panel on the Mac allows the end user to override the
application default directory.
.TP
\fB\-parent\fR \fIwindow\fR
Makes \fIwindow\fR the logical parent of the dialog. The dialog
is displayed on top of its parent window.
.TP
\fB\-title\fR \fItitleString\fR
Specifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If this
option is not specified, then a default title will be displayed.
.TP
\fB\-mustexist\fR \fIboolean\fR
Specifies whether the user may specify non-existent directories.  If
this parameter is true, then the user may only select directories that
already exist.  The default value is \fIfalse\fR.
.SH EXAMPLE
.CS
set dir [\fBtk_chooseDirectory\fR \\
        \-initialdir ~ \-title "Choose a directory"]
if {$dir eq ""} {
   label .l -text "No directory selected"
} else {
   label .l -text "Selected $dir"
}

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
