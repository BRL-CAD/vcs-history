.SH NAME
Tk_GetOption \- retrieve an option from the option database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
Tk_Uid
\fBTk_GetOption\fR(\fItkwin, name, class\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window *class
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window.
.AP "const char" *name in
Name of desired option.
.AP "const char" *class in
Class of desired option.  Null means there is no class for
this option;  do lookup based on name only.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure is invoked to retrieve an option from the database
associated with \fItkwin\fR's main window.  If there is an option
for \fItkwin\fR that matches the given \fIname\fR or \fIclass\fR,
then it is returned in the form of a Tk_Uid.  If multiple options
match \fIname\fR and \fIclass\fR, then the highest-priority one
is returned.  If no option matches, then NULL is returned.
.PP
\fBTk_GetOption\fR caches options related to \fItkwin\fR so that
successive calls for the same \fItkwin\fR will execute much more
quickly than successive calls for different windows.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
