.SH NAME
Tk_AddOption \- Add an option to the option database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
void
\fBTk_AddOption\fR(\fItkwin, name, value, priority\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window.
.AP "const char" *name in
Multi-element name of option.
.AP "const char" *value in
Value of option.
.AP int priority in
Overall priority level to use for option.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure is invoked to add an option to the database
associated with \fItkwin\fR's main window.  \fIName\fR
contains the option being specified and consists of names and/or
classes separated by asterisks or dots, in the usual X format.
\fIValue\fR contains the text string to associate with \fIname\fR;
this value will be returned in calls to \fBTk_GetOption\fR.
\fIPriority\fR specifies the priority of the value; when options are
queried using \fBTk_GetOption\fR, the value with the highest priority
is returned.  \fIPriority\fR must be between 0 and \fBTK_MAX_PRIO\fR.  Some
common priority values are:
.TP
20
Used for default values hard-coded into widgets.
.TP
40
Used for options specified in application-specific startup files.
.TP
60
Used for options specified in user-specific defaults files, such as
\fB.Xdefaults\fR, resource databases loaded into the X server, or
user-specific startup files.
.TP
80
Used for options specified interactively after the application starts
running.
.PP

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
