.SH NAME
Tk_MapWindow, Tk_UnmapWindow \- map or unmap a window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
Tk_Window
\fBTk_MapWindow\fR(\fItkwin\fR)
.sp
\fBTk_UnmapWindow\fR(\fItkwin\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window parent
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures may be used to map and unmap windows
managed by Tk.  \fBTk_MapWindow\fR maps the window given
by \fItkwin\fR, and also creates an X window corresponding
to \fItkwin\fR if it doesn't already exist.  See the
\fBTk_CreateWindow\fR manual entry for information on
deferred window creation.
\fBTk_UnmapWindow\fR unmaps \fItkwin\fR's window
from the screen.
.PP
If \fItkwin\fR is a child window (i.e. \fBTk_CreateWindow\fR was
used to create a child window), then event handlers interested in map 
and unmap events are invoked immediately.  If \fItkwin\fR isn't an 
internal window, then the event handlers will be invoked later, after 
X has seen the request and returned an event for it.
.PP
These procedures should be used in place of the X procedures
\fBXMapWindow\fR and \fBXUnmapWindow\fR, since they update
Tk's local data structure for \fItkwin\fR.  Applications
using Tk should not invoke \fBXMapWindow\fR and \fBXUnmapWindow\fR
directly.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
