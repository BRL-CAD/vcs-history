.SH NAME
Tk_MainWindow, Tk_GetNumMainWindows \- functions for querying main
window information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
Tk_Window
\fBTk_MainWindow\fR(\fIinterp\fR)
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetNumMainWindows\fR()

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *pathName
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in/out
Interpreter associated with the application.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A main window is a special kind of toplevel window used as the
outermost window in an application.
.PP
If \fIinterp\fR is associated with a Tk application then \fBTk_MainWindow\fR
returns the application's main window. If there is no Tk application
associated with \fIinterp\fR then \fBTk_MainWindow\fR returns NULL and
leaves an error message in \fIinterp->result\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_GetNumMainWindows\fR returns a count of the number of main
windows currently open in the process.

.SH KEYWORDS

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
