.SH NAME
tk_optionMenu \- Create an option menubutton and its menu
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtk_optionMenu \fIw varName value \fR?\fIvalue value ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure creates an option menubutton whose name is \fIw\fR,
plus an associated menu.
Together they allow the user to select one of the values
given by the \fIvalue\fR arguments.
The current value will be stored in the global variable whose
name is given by \fIvarName\fR and it will also be displayed as the label
in the option menubutton.
The user can click on the menubutton to display a menu containing
all of the \fIvalue\fRs and thereby select a new value.
Once a new value is selected, it will be stored in the variable
and appear in the option menubutton.
The current value can also be changed by setting the variable.
.PP
The return value from \fBtk_optionMenu\fR is the name of the menu
associated with \fIw\fR, so that the caller can change its configuration
options or manipulate it in other ways.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
