.SH NAME
tk_menuBar, tk_bindForTraversal \- Obsolete support for menu bars
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtk_menuBar \fIframe \fR?\fImenu menu ...\fR?
.sp
\fBtk_bindForTraversal \fIarg arg ... \fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures were used in Tk 3.6 and earlier releases to help
manage pulldown menus and to implement keyboard traversal of menus.
In Tk 4.0 and later releases they are no
longer needed.  Stubs for these procedures have been retained for
backward compatibility, but they have no effect.  You should remove
calls to these procedures from your code, since eventually the
procedures will go away.
.PP
From Tk 8.0 onwards, you should instead construct your menubar as a
normal \fBmenu\fR and then attach it to the \fBtoplevel\fR of your
choice using the \fB\-menu\fR option of that widget.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
menu(n), toplevel(n)

.SH KEYWORDS
keyboard traversal, menu, menu bar, post

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
