.SH NAME
Tk_StrictMotif \- Return value of tk_strictMotif variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_StrictMotif\fR(\fItkwin\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window tkwin
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure returns the current value of the \fBtk_strictMotif\fR
variable in the interpreter associated with \fItkwin\fR's application.
The value is returned as an integer that is either 0 or 1.
1 means that strict Motif compliance has been requested, so anything
that is not part of the Motif specification should be avoided.
0 means that ``Motif-like'' is good enough, and extra features
are welcome.
.PP
This procedure uses a link to the Tcl variable to provide much
faster access to the variable's value than could be had by calling
\fBTcl_GetVar\fR.

.SH KEYWORDS
Motif compliance, tk_strictMotif variable

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
