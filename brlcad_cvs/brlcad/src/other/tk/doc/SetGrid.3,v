.SH NAME
Tk_SetGrid, Tk_UnsetGrid \- control the grid for interactive resizing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_SetGrid\fR(\fItkwin, reqWidth, reqHeight, widthInc, heightInc\fR)
.sp
\fBTk_UnsetGrid\fR(\fItkwin\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window heightInc
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window.
.AP int reqWidth in
Width in grid units that corresponds to the pixel dimension \fItkwin\fR
has requested via \fBTk_GeometryRequest\fR.
.AP int reqHeight in
Height in grid units that corresponds to the pixel dimension \fItkwin\fR
has requested via \fBTk_GeometryRequest\fR.
.AP int widthInc in
Width of one grid unit, in pixels.
.AP int heightInc in
Height of one grid unit, in pixels.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_SetGrid\fR turns on gridded geometry management for \fItkwin\fR's
toplevel window and specifies the geometry of the grid.
\fBTk_SetGrid\fR is typically invoked by a widget when its \fBsetGrid\fR
option is true.
It restricts interactive resizing of \fItkwin\fR's toplevel window so
that the space allocated to the toplevel is equal to its requested
size plus or minus even multiples of \fIwidthInc\fR and \fIheightInc\fR.
Furthermore, the \fIreqWidth\fR and \fIreqHeight\fR values are
passed to the window manager so that it can report the window's
size in grid units during interactive resizes.
If \fItkwin\fR's configuration changes (e.g., the size of a grid unit
changes) then the widget should invoke \fBTk_SetGrid\fR again with the new
information.
.PP
\fBTk_UnsetGrid\fR cancels gridded geometry management for
\fItkwin\fR's toplevel window.
.PP
For each toplevel window there can be at most one internal window
with gridding enabled.
If \fBTk_SetGrid\fR or \fBTk_UnsetGrid\fR is invoked when some
other window is already controlling gridding for \fItkwin\fR's
toplevel, the calls for the new window have no effect.
.PP
See the \fBwm\fR manual entry for additional information on gridded geometry
management.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
