.SH NAME
Tk_ClearSelection \- Deselect a selection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_ClearSelection\fR(\fItkwin, selection\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window tkwin
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in

.AP Atom selection in
The name of selection to be cleared.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_ClearSelection\fR cancels the selection specified by the atom 
\fIselection\fR for the display containing \fItkwin\fR.
The selection need not be in \fItkwin\fR itself or even in
\fItkwin\fR's application.
If there is a window anywhere on \fItkwin\fR's display that
owns \fIselection\fR, the window will be notified and the
selection will be cleared.
If there is no owner for \fIselection\fR on the display, then the
procedure has no effect.

.SH KEYWORDS
clear, selection

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
