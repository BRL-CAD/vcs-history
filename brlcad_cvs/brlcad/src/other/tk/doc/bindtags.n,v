.SH NAME
bindtags \- Determine which bindings apply to a window, and order of evaluation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbindtags \fIwindow \fR?\fItagList\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
When a binding is created with the \fBbind\fR command, it is
associated either with a particular window such as \fB.a.b.c\fR,
a class name such as \fBButton\fR, the keyword \fBall\fR, or any
other string.
All of these forms are called \fIbinding tags\fR.
Each window contains a list of binding tags that determine how
events are processed for the window.
When an event occurs in a window, it is applied to each of the
window's tags in order:  for each tag, the most specific binding
that matches the given tag and event is executed.
See the \fBbind\fR command for more information on the matching
process.
.PP
By default, each window has four binding tags consisting of the
name of the window, the window's class name, the name of the window's
nearest toplevel ancestor, and \fBall\fR, in that order.
Toplevel windows have only three tags by default, since the toplevel
name is the same as that of the window.
The \fBbindtags\fR command allows the binding tags for a window to be
read and modified.
.PP
If \fBbindtags\fR is invoked with only one argument, then the
current set of binding tags for \fIwindow\fR is returned as a list.
If the \fItagList\fR argument is specified to \fBbindtags\fR,
then it must be a proper list; the tags for \fIwindow\fR are changed
to the elements of the list.
The elements of \fItagList\fR may be arbitrary strings;  however,
any tag starting with a dot is treated as the name of a window;  if
no window by that name exists at the time an event is processed,
then the tag is ignored for that event.
The order of the elements in \fItagList\fR determines the order in
which binding scripts are executed in response to events.
For example, the command
.CS
\fBbindtags .b {all . Button .b}\fR
.CE
reverses the order in which binding scripts will be evaluated for
a button named \fB.b\fR so that \fBall\fR bindings are invoked
first, following by bindings for \fB.b\fR's toplevel (``.''), followed by
class bindings, followed by bindings for \fB.b\fR.
If \fItagList\fR is an empty list then the binding tags for \fIwindow\fR
are returned to the default state described above.
.PP
The \fBbindtags\fR command may be used to introduce arbitrary
additional binding tags for a window, or to remove standard tags.
For example, the command
.CS
\fBbindtags .b {.b TrickyButton . all}\fR
.CE
replaces the \fBButton\fR tag for \fB.b\fR with \fBTrickyButton\fR.
This means that the default widget bindings for buttons, which are
associated with the \fBButton\fR tag, will no longer apply to \fB.b\fR,
but any bindings associated with \fBTrickyButton\fR (perhaps some
new button behavior) will apply.
.SH EXAMPLE
If you have a set of nested \fBframe\fR widgets and you want events
sent to a \fBbutton\fR widget to also be delivered to all the widgets
up to the current \fBtoplevel\fR (in contrast to Tk's default
behavior, where events are not delivered to those intermediate
windows) to make it easier to have accelerators that are only active
for part of a window, you could use a helper procedure like this to
help set things up:
.CS
proc setupBindtagsForTreeDelivery {widget} {
    set tags [list $widget [winfo class $widget]]
    set w $widget
    set t [winfo toplevel $w]
    while {$w ne $t} {
        set w [winfo parent $w]
        lappend tags $w
    }
    lappend tags all
    \fBbindtags\fR $widget $tags
}
.CE

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
