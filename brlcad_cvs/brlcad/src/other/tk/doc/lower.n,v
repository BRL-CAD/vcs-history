.SH NAME
lower \- Change a window's position in the stacking order
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlower \fIwindow \fR?\fIbelowThis\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
If the \fIbelowThis\fR argument is omitted then the command lowers
\fIwindow\fR so that it is below all of its siblings in the stacking
order (it will be obscured by any siblings that overlap it and
will not obscure any siblings).
If \fIbelowThis\fR is specified then it must be the path name of
a window that is either a sibling of \fIwindow\fR or the descendant
of a sibling of \fIwindow\fR.
In this case the \fBlower\fR command will insert
\fIwindow\fR into the stacking order just below \fIbelowThis\fR
(or the ancestor of \fIbelowThis\fR that is a sibling of \fIwindow\fR);
this could end up either raising or lowering \fIwindow\fR.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
