.SH NAME
tk_popup \- Post a popup menu
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtk_popup \fImenu x y \fR?\fIentry\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure posts a menu at a given position on the screen and
configures Tk so that the menu and its cascaded children can be
traversed with the mouse or the keyboard.
\fIMenu\fR is the name of a menu widget and \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR
are the root coordinates at which to display the menu.
If \fIentry\fR is omitted or an empty string, the
menu's upper left corner is positioned at the given point.
Otherwise \fIentry\fR gives the index of an entry in \fImenu\fR and
the menu will be positioned so that the entry is positioned over
the given point.
.SH EXAMPLE
How to attach a simple popup menu to a widget.
.CS
# Create a menu
set m [menu .popupMenu]
$m add command \-label "Example 1" \-command bell
$m add command \-label "Example 2" \-command bell

# Create something to attach it to
pack [label .l \-text "Click me!"]

# Arrange for the menu to pop up when the label is clicked
bind .l <1> {\fBtk_popup\fR .popupMenu %X %Y}

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
