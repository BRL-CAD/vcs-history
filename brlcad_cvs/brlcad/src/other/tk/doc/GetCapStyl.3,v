.SH NAME
Tk_GetCapStyle, Tk_NameOfCapStyle \- translate between strings and cap styles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetCapStyle(\fIinterp, string, capPtr\fB)\fR
.sp
const char *
\fBTk_NameOfCapStyle(\fIcap\fB)\fR
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "Tcl_Interp" *capPtr
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter to use for error reporting.
.AP "const char" *string in
String containing name of cap style: one of ```butt'', ``projecting'',
or ``round''.
.AP int *capPtr out
Pointer to location in which to store X cap style corresponding to
\fIstring\fR.
.AP int cap in
Cap style: one of \fBCapButt\fR, \fBCapProjecting\fR, or \fBCapRound\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_GetCapStyle\fR places in \fI*capPtr\fR the X cap style
corresponding to \fIstring\fR.
This will be one of the values
\fBCapButt\fR, \fBCapProjecting\fR, or \fBCapRound\fR.
Cap styles are typically used in X graphics contexts to indicate
how the end-points of lines should be capped.
See the X documentation for information on what each style
implies.
.PP
Under normal circumstances the return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR and
\fIinterp\fR is unused.
If \fIstring\fR doesn't contain a valid cap style
or an abbreviation of one of these names, then an error message is
stored in \fIinterp->result\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, and
\fI*capPtr\fR is unmodified.
.PP
\fBTk_NameOfCapStyle\fR is the logical inverse of \fBTk_GetCapStyle\fR.
Given a cap style such as \fBCapButt\fR it returns a
statically-allocated string corresponding to \fIcap\fR.
If \fIcap\fR isn't a legal cap style, then
``unknown cap style'' is returned.

.SH KEYWORDS
butt, cap style, projecting, round

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
