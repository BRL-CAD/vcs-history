.SH NAME
Tk_GetPixelsFromObj, Tk_GetPixels, Tk_GetMMFromObj, Tk_GetScreenMM \- translate between strings and screen units
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetPixelsFromObj(\fIinterp, tkwin, objPtr, intPtr\fB)\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetPixels(\fIinterp, tkwin, string, intPtr\fB)\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetMMFromObj(\fIinterp, tkwin, objPtr, doublePtr\fB)\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetScreenMM(\fIinterp, tkwin, string, doublePtr\fB)\fR
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "Tcl_Interp" *joinPtr
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter to use for error reporting.
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Window whose screen geometry determines the conversion between absolute
units and pixels.
.AP Tcl_Obj *objPtr in/out
String value specifies a distance on the screen;
internal rep will be modified to cache converted distance.
.AP "const char" *string in
Same as \fIobjPtr\fR except specification of distance is passed as
a string.
.AP int *intPtr out
Pointer to location in which to store converted distance in pixels.
.AP double *doublePtr out
Pointer to location in which to store converted distance in millimeters.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures take as argument a specification of distance on
the screen (\fIobjPtr\fR or \fIstring\fR) and compute the
corresponding distance either in integer pixels or floating-point millimeters.
In either case,
\fIobjPtr\fR or \fIstring\fR
specifies a screen distance as a
floating-point number followed by one of the following characters
that indicates units:
.TP
<none>
The number specifies a distance in pixels.
.TP
\fBc\fR
The number specifies a distance in centimeters on the screen.
.TP
\fBi\fR
The number specifies a distance in inches on the screen.
.TP
\fBm\fR
The number specifies a distance in millimeters on the screen.
.TP
\fBp\fR
The number specifies a distance in printer's points (1/72 inch)
on the screen.
.PP
\fBTk_GetPixelsFromObj\fR converts the value of \fIobjPtr\fR to the
nearest even number of pixels and stores that value at \fI*intPtr\fR.
It returns \fBTCL_OK\fR under normal circumstances.
If an error occurs (e.g. \fIobjPtr\fR contains a number followed
by a character that isn't one of the ones above) then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned and an error message is left
in \fIinterp\fR's result if \fIinterp\fR isn't NULL.
\fBTk_GetPixelsFromObj\fR caches information about the return
value in \fIobjPtr\fR, which speeds up future calls to
\fBTk_GetPixelsFromObj\fR with the same \fIobjPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_GetPixels\fR is identical to \fBTk_GetPixelsFromObj\fR except
that the screen distance is specified with a string instead
of an object.  This prevents \fBTk_GetPixels\fR from caching the
return value, so \fBTk_GetAnchor\fR is less efficient than
\fBTk_GetPixelsFromObj\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_GetMMFromObj\fR and \fBTk_GetScreenMM\fR are similar to
\fBTk_GetPixelsFromObj\fR and \fBTk_GetPixels\fR (respectively) except
that they convert the screen distance to millimeters and
store a double-precision floating-point result at \fI*doublePtr\fR.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
