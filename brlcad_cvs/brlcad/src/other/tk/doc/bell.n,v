.SH NAME
bell \- Ring a display's bell
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbell \fR?\fB\-displayof \fIwindow\fR? ?\fB\-nice\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command rings the bell on the display for \fIwindow\fR and
returns an empty string.
If the \fB\-displayof\fR option is omitted, the display of the
application's main window is used by default.
The command uses the current bell-related settings for the display, which
may be modified with programs such as \fBxset\fR.
.PP
If \fB\-nice\fR is not specified, this command also resets the screen saver
for the screen.  Some screen savers will ignore this, but others will reset
so that the screen becomes visible again.

.SH KEYWORDS
beep, bell, ring

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
