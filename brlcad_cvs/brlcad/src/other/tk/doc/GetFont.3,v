Tk_AllocFontFromObj, Tk_GetFont, Tk_GetFontFromObj, Tk_NameOfFont, Tk_FreeFontFromObj, Tk_FreeFont \- maintain database of fonts

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "const char" *tkfont
.AP "Tcl_Interp" *interp in
Interpreter to use for error reporting.  If \fBNULL\fR, then no error
messages are left after errors.
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window in which font will be used.
.AP Tcl_Obj *objPtr in/out
Gives name or description of font.  See documentation
for the \fBfont\fR command for details on acceptable formats.
Internal rep will be modified to cache corresponding Tk_Font.
.AP "const char" *string in
Same as \fIobjPtr\fR except description of font is passed as a string and
resulting Tk_Font isn't cached.
.AP Tk_Font tkfont in
Opaque font token.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR finds the font indicated by \fIobjPtr\fR and
returns a token that represents the font.  The return value can be used
in subsequent calls to procedures such as \fBTk_GetFontMetrics\fR,
\fBTk_MeasureChars\fR, and \fBTk_FreeFont\fR.  The Tk_Font token
will remain valid until
\fBTk_FreeFontFromObj\fR or \fBTk_FreeFont\fR is called to release it. 
\fIObjPtr\fR can contain either a symbolic name or a font description; see
the documentation for the \fBfont\fR command for a description of the
valid formats.  If \fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR is unsuccessful (because,
for example, \fIobjPtr\fR did not contain a valid font specification) then it
returns \fBNULL\fR and leaves an error message in \fIinterp\fR's result
if \fIinterp\fR isn't \fBNULL\fR.  \fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR caches
information about the return
value in \fIobjPtr\fR, which speeds up future calls to procedures
such as \fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR and \fBTk_GetFontFromObj\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_GetFont\fR is identical to \fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR except
that the description of the font is specified with a string instead
of an object.  This prevents \fBTk_GetFont\fR from caching the
matching Tk_Font, so \fBTk_GetFont\fR is less efficient than
\fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_GetFontFromObj\fR returns the token for an existing font, given
the window and description used to create the font.
\fBTk_GetFontFromObj\fR doesn't actually create the font; the font
must already have been created with a previous call to
\fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR or \fBTk_GetFont\fR.  The return
value is cached in \fIobjPtr\fR, which speeds up
future calls to \fBTk_GetFontFromObj\fR with the same \fIobjPtr\fR
and \fItkwin\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR and \fBTk_GetFont\fR maintain
a database of all fonts they have allocated.  If
the same font is requested multiple times (e.g. by different
windows or for different purposes), then a single Tk_Font will be
shared for all uses.  The underlying resources will be freed automatically
when no-one is using the font anymore.
.PP
The procedure \fBTk_NameOfFont\fR is roughly the inverse of
\fBTk_GetFont\fR.  Given a \fItkfont\fR that was created by
\fBTk_GetFont\fR (or \fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR), the return value is
the \fIstring\fR argument that was
passed to \fBTk_GetFont\fR to create the font.  The string returned by
\fBTk_NameOfFont\fR is only guaranteed to persist until the \fItkfont\fR
is deleted.  The caller must not modify this string.
.PP
When a font is no longer needed,
\fBTk_FreeFontFromObj\fR or \fBTk_FreeFont\fR should be called to
release it.  For \fBTk_FreeFontFromObj\fR the font to release is specified
with the same information used to create it; for
\fBTk_FreeFont\fR the font to release is specified
with its Tk_Font token.  There should be
exactly one call to \fBTk_FreeFontFromObj\fR or \fBTk_FreeFont\fR
for each call to \fBTk_AllocFontFromObj\fR or \fBTk_GetFont\fR.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
