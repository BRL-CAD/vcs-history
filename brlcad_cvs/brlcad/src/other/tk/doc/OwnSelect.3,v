.SH NAME
Tk_OwnSelection \- make a window the owner of the primary selection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_OwnSelection\fR(\fItkwin, selection, proc, clientData\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_LostSelProc clientData
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Window that is to become new selection owner.
.AP Atom selection in
The name of the selection to be owned, such as XA_PRIMARY.
.AP Tk_LostSelProc *proc in
Procedure to invoke when \fItkwin\fR loses selection ownership later.
.AP ClientData clientData in
Arbitrary one-word value to pass to \fIproc\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_OwnSelection\fR arranges for \fItkwin\fR to become the
new owner of the selection specified by the atom
\fIselection\fR.  After this call completes, future requests
for the selection will be directed to handlers created for
\fItkwin\fR using \fBTk_CreateSelHandler\fR.  When \fItkwin\fR
eventually loses the selection ownership, \fIproc\fR will be
invoked so that the window can clean itself up (e.g. by
unhighlighting the selection).  \fIProc\fR should have arguments and
result that match the type \fBTk_LostSelProc\fR:
.CS
typedef void Tk_LostSelProc(ClientData \fIclientData\fR);
.CE
The \fIclientData\fR parameter to \fIproc\fR is a copy of the
\fIclientData\fR argument given to \fBTk_OwnSelection\fR, and is
usually a pointer to a data structure containing application-specific
information about \fItkwin\fR.

.SH KEYWORDS
own, selection owner

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
