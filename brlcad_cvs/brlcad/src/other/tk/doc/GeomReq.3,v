.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_GeometryRequest\fR is called by widget code to indicate its
preference for the dimensions of a particular window.  The arguments
to \fBTk_GeometryRequest\fR are made available to the geometry
manager for the window, which then decides on the actual geometry
for the window.  Although geometry managers generally try to satisfy
requests made to \fBTk_GeometryRequest\fR, there is no guarantee that
this will always be possible.  Widget code should not assume that
a geometry request will be satisfied until it receives a
\fBConfigureNotify\fR event indicating that the geometry change has
occurred.  Widget code should never call procedures like
\fBTk_ResizeWindow\fR directly.  Instead, it should invoke
\fBTk_GeometryRequest\fR and leave the final geometry decisions to
the geometry manager.
.PP
If \fItkwin\fR is a top-level window, then the geometry information
will be passed to the window manager using the standard ICCCM protocol.
.PP
\fBTk_SetInternalBorder\fR is called by widget code to indicate that
the widget has an internal border.  This means that the widget draws
a decorative border inside the window instead of using the standard
X borders, which are external to the window's area.  For example,
internal borders are used to draw 3-D effects.  \fIWidth\fR
specifies the width of the border in pixels.  Geometry managers will
use this information to avoid placing any children of \fItkwin\fR
overlapping the outermost \fIwidth\fR pixels of \fItkwin\fR's area.
.PP
\fBTk_SetInternalBorderEx\fR works like \fBTk_SetInternalBorder\fR
but lets you specify different widths for different sides of the window.
.PP
\fBTk_SetMinimumRequestSize\fR is called by widget code to indicate
that a geometry manager should request at least this size for the
widget.  This allows a widget to have some control over its size when
a propagating geometry manager is used inside it.
.PP
The information specified in calls to \fBTk_GeometryRequest\fR,
\fBTk_SetMinimumRequestSize\fR, \fBTk_SetInternalBorder\fR and
\fBTk_SetInternalBorderEx\fR can be retrieved using the macros
\fBTk_ReqWidth\fR, \fBTk_ReqHeight\fR, \fBTk_MinReqWidth\fR,
\fBTk_MinReqHeight\fR, \fBTk_MinReqWidth\fR, \fBTk_InternalBorderLeft\fR,
\fBTk_InternalBorderRight\fR, \fBTk_InternalBorderTop\fR and
\fBTk_InternalBorderBottom\fR.
See the \fBTk_WindowId\fR manual entry for details.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
