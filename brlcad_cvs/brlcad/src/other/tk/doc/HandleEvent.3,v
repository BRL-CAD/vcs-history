.SH NAME
Tk_HandleEvent \- invoke event handlers for window system events
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_HandleEvent\fR(\fIeventPtr\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS XEvent *eventPtr
.AP XEvent *eventPtr in
Pointer to X event to dispatch to relevant handler(s).

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_HandleEvent\fR is a lower-level procedure that deals with window
events.  It is called by \fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR (and indirectly by
\fBTk_DoOneEvent\fR), and in a few other cases within Tk.
It makes callbacks to any window event
handlers (created by calls to \fBTk_CreateEventHandler\fR)
that match \fIeventPtr\fR and then returns.  In some cases
it may be useful for an application to bypass the Tk event
queue and call \fBTk_HandleEvent\fR directly instead of
calling \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR followed by
\fBTcl_ServiceEvent\fR.
.PP
This procedure may be invoked recursively.  For example,
it is possible to invoke \fBTk_HandleEvent\fR recursively
from a handler called by \fBTk_HandleEvent\fR.  This sort
of operation is useful in some modal situations, such
as when a
notifier has been popped up and an application wishes to
wait for the user to click a button in the notifier before
doing anything else.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
