.SH NAME
tk_messageBox \- pops up a message window and waits for user response.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtk_messageBox \fR?\fIoption value ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure creates and displays a message window with an
application-specified message, an icon and a set of buttons.  Each of
the buttons in the message window is identified by a unique symbolic
name (see the \fB\-type\fR options).  After the message window is
popped up, \fBtk_messageBox\fR waits for the user to select one of the
buttons. Then it returns the symbolic name of the selected button.

The following option-value pairs are supported:
.TP
\fB\-default\fR \fIname\fR
\fIName\fR gives the symbolic name of the default button for
this message window ('ok', 'cancel', and so on). See \fB\-type\fR 
for a list of the symbolic names.  If this option is not specified,
the first button in the dialog will be made the default.
.TP
\fB\-detail\fR \fIstring\fR
.VS 8.5
Specifies an auxiliary message to the main message given by the
\fB\-message\fR option.  Where supported by the underlying OS, the
message detail will be presented in a less emphasized font than the
main message.
.VE 8.5
.TP
\fB\-icon\fR \fIiconImage\fR
Specifies an icon to display. \fIIconImage\fR must be one of the
following: \fBerror\fR, \fBinfo\fR, \fBquestion\fR or
\fBwarning\fR. If this option is not specified, then the info icon will be
displayed.
.TP
\fB\-message\fR \fIstring\fR
Specifies the message to display in this message box.
.TP
\fB\-parent\fR \fIwindow\fR
Makes \fIwindow\fR the logical parent of the message box. The message
box is displayed on top of its parent window.
.TP
\fB\-title\fR \fItitleString\fR
Specifies a string to display as the title of the message box. The
default value is an empty string.
.TP
\fB\-type\fR \fIpredefinedType\fR
Arranges for a predefined set of buttons to be displayed. The
following values are possible for \fIpredefinedType\fR:
.RS
.TP 18
\fBabortretryignore\fR
Displays three buttons whose symbolic names are \fBabort\fR,
\fBretry\fR and \fBignore\fR.
.TP 18
\fBok\fR
Displays one button whose symbolic name is \fBok\fR.
.TP 18
\fBokcancel\fR
Displays two buttons whose symbolic names are \fBok\fR and \fBcancel\fR.
.TP 18
\fBretrycancel\fR
Displays two buttons whose symbolic names are \fBretry\fR and \fBcancel\fR.
.TP 18
\fByesno\fR
Displays two buttons whose symbolic names are \fByes\fR and \fBno\fR.
.TP 18
\fByesnocancel\fR
Displays three buttons whose symbolic names are \fByes\fR, \fBno\fR
and \fBcancel\fR.

1.1
log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
