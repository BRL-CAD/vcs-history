.TH Tk_QueueWindowEvent 3 7.5 Tk "Tk Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Tk_CollapseMotionEvents, Tk_QueueWindowEvent \- Add a window event to the Tcl event queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_CollapseMotionEvents\fR(\fIdisplay, collapse\fR)
.sp
\fBTk_QueueWindowEvent\fR(\fIeventPtr, position\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_QueuePosition position
.AP Display *display  in
Display for which to control motion event collapsing.
.AP int collapse in
Indicates whether motion events should be collapsed or not.
.AP XEvent *eventPtr  in
An event to add to the event queue.
.AP Tcl_QueuePosition position in
Where to add the new event in the queue:  \fBTCL_QUEUE_TAIL\fR,
\fBTCL_QUEUE_HEAD\fR, or \fBTCL_QUEUE_MARK\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_QueueWindowEvent\fR places a window event on Tcl's internal event
queue for eventual servicing.  It creates a Tcl_Event structure, copies the
event into that structure, and calls \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR to add the event
to the queue.  When the event is eventually removed from the queue it is
processed just like all window events.
.PP
When multiple motion events are received for the same window in rapid
succession, they are collapsed by default.  This behavior can be controlled
with \fBTk_CollapseMotionEvents\fR.  \fBTk_CollapseMotionEvents\fR always
returns the previous value for collapse behavior on the \fIdisplay\fR.
.PP
The \fIposition\fR argument to \fBTk_QueueWindowEvent\fR has
the same significance as for \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR;  see the
documentation for \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR for details.

.SH KEYWORDS

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
