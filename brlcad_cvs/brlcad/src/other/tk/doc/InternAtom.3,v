.TH Tk_InternAtom 3 "" Tk "Tk Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Tk_InternAtom, Tk_GetAtomName \- manage cache of X atoms
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
Atom
\fBTk_InternAtom(\fItkwin, name\fR)
.sp
const char *
\fBTk_GetAtomName(\fItkwin, atom\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window parent
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window.  Used to map atom or name relative to a particular display.
.AP "const char" *name in
String name for which atom is desired.
.AP Atom atom in
Atom for which corresponding string name is desired.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are similar to the Xlib procedures
\fBXInternAtom\fR and \fBXGetAtomName\fR.  \fBTk_InternAtom\fR
returns the atom identifier associated with string given by
\fIname\fR;  the atom identifier is only valid for the display
associated with \fItkwin\fR.
\fBTk_GetAtomName\fR returns the string associated
with \fIatom\fR on \fItkwin\fR's display.  The string returned
by \fBTk_GetAtomName\fR is in Tk's storage:  the caller need
not free this space when finished with the string, and the caller
should not modify the contents of the returned string.
If there is no atom \fIatom\fR on \fItkwin\fR's display,
then \fBTk_GetAtomName\fR returns the string ``?bad atom?''.
.PP
Tk caches
the information returned by \fBTk_InternAtom\fR and \fBTk_GetAtomName\fR
so that future calls
for the same information can be serviced from the cache without
contacting the server.  Thus \fBTk_InternAtom\fR and \fBTk_GetAtomName\fR
are generally much faster than their Xlib counterparts, and they
should be used in place of the Xlib procedures.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
