Changes since the last public release (1.2.18):

version 1.2.19 [August 18, 2007]

  Changed "const static" to "static PNG_CONST" everywhere, mostly undoing
    change of libpng-1.2.17beta2.  Changed other "const" to "PNG_CONST"
  Fixed png_do_expand() to only use the appropriate bits of tRNS value.
  Fixed png_handle_tRNS() to only use the appropriate bits of tRNS value.
  Add some "png_byte" typecasts in png_check_keyword().
  Write new_key instead of key in zTXt chunk.
  Add png_snprintf() function and use it in place of sprint() for improved
    defense against buffer overflows.
  Changed handling of some unused parameters, to avoid compiler warnings.
  Removed some PNG_CONST in pngwutil.c to avoid compiler warnings.
  Added some #ifdef PNG_MMX_CODE_SUPPORTED where needed in pngvcrd.c
  Squelched png_squelch_warnings() in pnggccrd.c; Use "__attribute__((used))"
    instead.
  Removed __MMX__ from test in pngconf.h.
  Updated makefile.sgcc and makefile.solaris; added makefile.solaris-x86.
  Return 0 from png_get_sPLT() and png_get_unknown_chunks() if png_ptr is NULL;
    changed three remaining instances of png_strcpy() to png_strncpy() (David
    Hill).
  Make test for NULL row_buf at the beginning of png_do_read_transformations
    unconditional.
  Prefer PNG_USE_PNGVCRD when _MSC_VER is defined in pngconf.h
  Revised pnggccrd.c.
  Updated contrib/gregbook.
  Changed '#include "pnggccrd.c"' to 'include "$srcdir/pnggccrd.c"'
    in configure.ac
  Revised many of the makefiles, to set -DPNG_NO_MMX_CODE where needed
    and to not use -O3 unless -DPNG_NO_MMX_CODE is also set.
  Copied optimized C code from pnggccrd.c to pngrutil.c, removed dependency
    on pnggccrd.o from many makefiles.
  Added sl and dylib to list of extensions be installed by Makefile.am
  Fixed testing PNG_RGB_TO_GRAY_ERR & PNG_RGB_TO_GRAY_WARN in pngrtran.c
  Revised pngvcrd.c.
  Rebuilt Makefile.in and configure using libtool-1.5.24.
  Added "test" target to Makefile.in and Makefile.am
  Added info about pngrutil/pnggccrd/pngvcrd to png_get_header_version()
  Added PNG_NO_WRITE_FILTER and PNG_NO_WARNING macros.
  Added contrib/pngminim to demonstrate building minimal encoder and decoder
  Changed "png_free(str)" to "png_free(png_ptr,str)" in pngrutil.c WinCE
    code (Yves Piguet).  This bug was introduced in libpng-1.2.14.
  Updated scripts/CMakeLists.txt
  Fixed incorrect stride and number of bytes copied (was 4 instead of
    6 bytes) in the cleanup loop of pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c for handling
    the end of 48-bit interlaced rows (Glenn R-P).
  Added png_warning() in pngrutil.c for short iCCP, iTXt, sPLT, or zTXT chunks.
  Revised pngtest.c so warnings are displayed regardless of PNG_NO_STDIO.
  Disable PNG_MMX_CODE_SUPPORTED when PNG_ASSEMBLER_CODE_SUPPORTED is off.
  Added information about disabling the MMX code in libpng documentation.
  Removed some "#if 0" blocks.
  Made a global struct local in pngvcrd.c to make it thread safe.
  Change default to PNG_NO_GLOBAL_ARRAYS for MSVC.
  Revise handling of png_strtod in recent versions of WINCE
  Issue a png_error() if application attempts to transform a row tht
    has not been initialized.

  Fixed bug in png_text_compress() that would fail to complete a large block.
  Fixed bug, introduced in libpng-1.2.7, that overruns a buffer during
    strip alpha operation in png_do_strip_filler().

  #ifdef out png_info_init in png.c and png_read_init in pngread.c (as of 1.3.0)
  Reduce color_type to a nonalpha type after strip alpha operation in
    png_do_strip_filler().
  Revised definitions of PNG_MAX_UINT_32, PNG_MAX_SIZE, and PNG_MAXSUM
  Fixed (again) definition of PNG_LIBPNG_VER_DLLNUM in png.h (Cosmin).
  Added PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_PRIVATE in png.h (Cosmin).
  Set png_ptr->zstream.data_type to Z_BINARY, to avoid unnecessary detection
    of data type in deflate (Cosmin).
  Deprecated but continue to support SPECIALBUILD and PRIVATEBUILD in favor of
    PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_SPECIAL_STRING and PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_PRIVATE_STRING.
  Despammed mailing addresses by masking "@@" with "at".
  Added scripts/makefile.elf with supporting code in pngconf.h for symbol
    versioning (John Bowler).
  Added projects/visualc71 (Simon-pierre).
