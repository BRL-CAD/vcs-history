Known bugs in libpng version 1.2.22

1. February 23, 2006: The custom makefiles don't build libpng with -lz.

   STATUS: This is a subject of debate. The change will probably be made
   as a part of a major overhaul of the makefiles in libpng version 1.3.0.

2. February 24, 2006: The Makefile generated by the "configure" script
   fails to install symbolic links
   libpng12.so => libpng12.so.0.1.2.9betaN
   that are generated by the custom makefiles.

3. September 4, 2007:  There is a report that pngtest crashes on MacOS 10.

   STATUS: workarounds are
      1) Compile without optimization (crashes are observed with
         -arch i386 and -O2 or -O3, using gcc-4.0.1.
      2) Compile pngtest.c with PNG_DEBUG defined (the bug goes away if
         you try to look at it).
      3) Ignore the crash.  The library itself seems to be OK.

@update from libpng 1.2.16 to 1.2.19, picking up a handful of fixes.  nothing too critical as far as I can tell, but does reportedly include a minor security fix and major bug fixes (going from freshmeat categories)

1. April 22, 2001: pnggccrd.c has been reported to crash on NetBSD when
   reading interlaced PNG files, when assembler code is enabled but running
   on a non-MMX i386 platform.

   STATUS: Under investigation.  The change to pnggccrd.c in libpng-1.2.1
   fixed a problem under FreeBSD but not the problem with NetBSD, which
   still fails as of libpng-1.2.2rc1.

4. June 28, 2007: Pnggccrd.c has been reported to be unreliable on
   several 64-bit platforms running gcc-3.x.  Although it appears to
   build properly, it does not always read files correctly.

   STATUS:  Appears to be a bug in the 64-bit version of gcc-3.4.6.
   Workarounds are to define PNG_NO_MMX_FILTER_UP|AVG|PAETH (as in
   pngconf.h) or to upgrade gcc to a newer version.
