@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

 * Tk_SetAppName --
 *
 *	This procedure is called to associate an ASCII name with a Tk
 *	application.  If the application has already been named, the
 *	name replaces the old one.
 *
 * Results:
 *	The return value is the name actually given to the application.
 *	This will normally be the same as name, but if name was already
 *	in use for an application then a name of the form "name #2" will
 *	be chosen,  with a high enough number to make the name unique.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Registration info is saved, thereby allowing the "send" command
 *	to be used later to invoke commands in the application.  In
 *	addition, the "send" command is created in the application's
 *	interpreter.  The registration will be removed automatically
 *	if the interpreter is deleted or the "send" command is removed.
