@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.TH Tk_GetJustifyFromObj 3 8.1 Tk "Tk Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Tk_GetJustifyFromObj, Tk_GetJustify, Tk_NameOfJustify \- translate between strings and justification styles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
.VS 8.1
int
\fBTk_GetJustifyFromObj(\fIinterp, objPtr, justifyPtr\fB)\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetJustify(\fIinterp, string, justifyPtr\fB)\fR
.sp
CONST char *
\fBTk_NameOfJustify(\fIjustify\fB)\fR
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "Tk_Justify" *justifyPtr
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter to use for error reporting, or NULL.
.VS 8.1 br
.AP Tcl_Obj *objPtr in/out
String value contains name of justification style (\fBleft\fR, \fBright\fR, or
\fBcenter\fR).  The
internal rep will be modified to cache corresponding justify value.
.AP "CONST char" *string in
Same as \fIobjPtr\fR except description of justification style is passed as
a string.
.VE
.AP int *justifyPtr out
Pointer to location in which to store justify value corresponding to
\fIobjPtr\fR or \fIstring\fR.
.AP Tk_Justify justify in
Justification style (one of the values listed below).
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.VS 8.1
\fBTk_GetJustifyFromObj\fR places in \fI*justifyPtr\fR the justify value
corresponding to \fIobjPtr\fR's value.
.VE
This value will be one of the following:
.TP
\fBTK_JUSTIFY_LEFT\fR
Means that the text on each line should start at the left edge of
the line;  as a result, the right edges of lines may be ragged.
.TP
\fBTK_JUSTIFY_RIGHT\fR
Means that the text on each line should end at the right edge of
the line;  as a result, the left edges of lines may be ragged.
.TP
\fBTK_JUSTIFY_CENTER\fR
Means that the text on each line should be centered;  as a result,
both the left and right edges of lines may be ragged.
.PP
.VS 8.1
Under normal circumstances the return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR and
\fIinterp\fR is unused.
If \fIobjPtr\fR doesn't contain a valid justification style
or an abbreviation of one of these names, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
\fI*justifyPtr\fR is unmodified, and an error message is
stored in \fIinterp\fR's result if \fIinterp\fR isn't NULL.
\fBTk_GetJustifyFromObj\fR caches information about the return
value in \fIobjPtr\fR, which speeds up future calls to
\fBTk_GetJustifyFromObj\fR with the same \fIobjPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_GetJustify\fR is identical to \fBTk_GetJustifyFromObj\fR except
that the description of the justification is specified with a string instead
of an object.  This prevents \fBTk_GetJustify\fR from caching the
return value, so \fBTk_GetJustify\fR is less efficient than
\fBTk_GetJustifyFromObj\fR.
.VE
.PP
\fBTk_NameOfJustify\fR is the logical inverse of \fBTk_GetJustify\fR.
Given a justify value it returns a statically-allocated string
corresponding to \fIjustify\fR.
If \fIjustify\fR isn't a legal justify value, then
``unknown justification style'' is returned.

.SH KEYWORDS
center, fill, justification, string
