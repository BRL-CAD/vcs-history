@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.TH Tk_GetAnchorFromObj 3 8.1 Tk "Tk Library Procedures"

.SH NAME
Tk_GetAnchorFromObj, Tk_GetAnchor, Tk_NameOfAnchor \- translate between strings and anchor positions
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
.VS 8.1
int
\fBTk_GetAnchorFromObj(\fIinterp, objPtr, anchorPtr\fB)\fR
.VE
.sp

\fBTk_GetAnchor(\fIinterp, string, anchorPtr\fB)\fR
.sp
CONST char *
\fBTk_NameOfAnchor(\fIanchor\fB)\fR
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "Tk_Anchor" *anchorPtr
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter to use for error reporting, or NULL.
.VS 8.1 br
.AP Tcl_Obj *objPtr in/out
String value contains name of anchor point: \fBn\fR, \fBne\fR,
\fBe\fR, \fBse\fR, \fBs\fR, \fBsw\fR, \fBw\fR, \fBnw\fR, or \fBcenter\fR;
internal rep will be modified to cache corresponding Tk_Anchor.
.AP "CONST char" *string in
Same as \fIobjPtr\fR except description of anchor point is passed as
a string.
.VE
.AP int *anchorPtr out
Pointer to location in which to store anchor position corresponding to
\fIobjPtr\fR or \fIstring\fR.
.AP Tk_Anchor anchor in
Anchor position, e.g. \fBTCL_ANCHOR_CENTER\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.VS 8.1
\fBTk_GetAnchorFromObj\fR places in \fI*anchorPtr\fR an anchor position
(enumerated type \fBTk_Anchor\fR)
corresponding to \fIobjPtr\fR's value.  The result will be one of
\fBTK_ANCHOR_N\fR, \fBTK_ANCHOR_NE\fR, \fBTK_ANCHOR_E\fR, \fBTK_ANCHOR_SE\fR,
\fBTK_ANCHOR_S\fR, \fBTK_ANCHOR_SW\fR, \fBTK_ANCHOR_W\fR, \fBTK_ANCHOR_NW\fR,
or \fBTK_ANCHOR_CENTER\fR.
Anchor positions are typically used for indicating a point on an object
that will be used to position the object, e.g. \fBTK_ANCHOR_N\fR means
position the top center point of the object at a particular place.
.PP
Under normal circumstances the return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR and
\fIinterp\fR is unused.
If \fIstring\fR doesn't contain a valid anchor position
or an abbreviation of one of these names, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned,
\fI*anchorPtr\fR is unmodified, and an error message is
stored in \fIinterp\fR's result if \fIinterp\fR isn't NULL.
\fBTk_GetAnchorFromObj\fR caches information about the return
value in \fIobjPtr\fR, which speeds up future calls to
\fBTk_GetAnchorFromObj\fR with the same \fIobjPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_GetAnchor\fR is identical to \fBTk_GetAnchorFromObj\fR except
that the description of the anchor is specified with a string instead
of an object.  This prevents \fBTk_GetAnchor\fR from caching the
return value, so \fBTk_GetAnchor\fR is less efficient than
\fBTk_GetAnchorFromObj\fR.
.VE
.PP
\fBTk_NameOfAnchor\fR is the logical inverse of \fBTk_GetAnchor\fR.
Given an anchor position such as \fBTK_ANCHOR_N\fR it returns a
statically-allocated string corresponding to \fIanchor\fR.
If \fIanchor\fR isn't a legal anchor value, then
``unknown anchor position'' is returned.
