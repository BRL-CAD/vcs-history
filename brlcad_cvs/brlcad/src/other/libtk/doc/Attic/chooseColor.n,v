@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

The procedure \fBtk_chooseColor\fR pops up a dialog box for the
user to select a color. The following \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are
possible as command line arguments:
.TP
\fB\-initialcolor\fR \fIcolor\fR
Specifies the color to display in the color dialog when it pops
up. \fIcolor\fR must be in a form acceptable to the \fBTk_GetColor\fR
function.
.TP
\fB\-parent\fR \fIwindow\fR
Makes \fIwindow\fR the logical parent of the color dialog. The color
dialog is displayed on top of its parent window.
.TP
\fB\-title\fR \fItitleString\fR
Specifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If this
option is not specified, then a default title will be displayed.
.LP
If the user selects a color, \fBtk_chooseColor\fR will return the
name of the color in a form acceptable to \fBTk_GetColor\fR.  If the
user cancels the operation, both commands will return the empty
string.
