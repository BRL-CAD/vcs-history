@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.TH Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler 3 "8.4" Tk "Tk Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Tk_CreateClientMessageHandler, Tk_DeleteClientMessageHandler \- associate procedure callback with ClientMessage type X events
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_CreateClientMessageHandler\fR(\fIproc\fR)
.sp
\fBTk_DeleteClientMessageHandler\fR(\fIproc\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AP Tk_ClientMessageProc *proc in
Procedure to invoke whenever a ClientMessage X event occurs on any display.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fBTk_CreateClientMessageHandler\fR arranges for \fIproc\fR to be invoked
in the future whenever a ClientMessage X event occurs that isn't handled by
\fBWM_PROTOCOL\fR.  \fBTk_CreateClientMessageHandler\fR is intended for use
by applications which need to watch X ClientMessage events, such as drag and
drop applications.
.PP
The callback to \fIproc\fR will be made by \fBTk_HandleEvent\fR;
this mechanism only works in programs that dispatch events
through \fBTk_HandleEvent\fR (or through other Tk procedures that
call \fBTk_HandleEvent\fR, such as \fBTk_DoOneEvent\fR or
\fBTk_MainLoop\fR).
.PP
\fIProc\fR should have arguments and result that match the
type \fBTk_ClientMessageProc\fR:
.CS
typedef int Tk_ClientMessageProc(
	Tk_Window \fItkwin\fR,
	XEvent *\fIeventPtr\fR);
.CE
The \fItkwin\fR parameter to \fIproc\fR is the Tk window which is
associated with this event.  \fIEventPtr\fR is a pointer to the X event.
.PP
Whenever an X ClientMessage event is processed by \fBTk_HandleEvent\fR,
the \fIproc\fR is called if it wasn't handled as a \fBWM_PROTOCOL\fR.
The return value from \fIproc\fR is normally 0.
A non-zero return value indicates that the event is not to be handled
further; that is, \fIproc\fR has done all processing that is to be
allowed for the event.
.PP
If there are multiple ClientMessage event handlers, each one is called
for each event, in the order in which they were established.
.PP
\fBTk_DeleteClientMessageHandler\fR may be called to delete a
previously-created ClientMessage event handler: it deletes each handler it
finds that matches the \fIproc\fR argument.  If no such handler exists,
then \fBTk_DeleteClientMessageHandler\fR returns without doing anything.
Although Tk supports it, it's probably a bad idea to have more than one
callback with the same \fIproc\fR argument.
