@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are called by canvas type managers to carry out
common functions related to generating Postscript.
Most of the procedures take a \fIcanvas\fR argument, which
refers to a canvas widget for which Postscript is being
generated.
.PP
\fBTk_CanvasPsY\fR takes as argument a y-coordinate in the space of
a canvas and returns the value that should be used for that point
in the Postscript currently being generated for \fIcanvas\fR.
Y coordinates require transformation because Postscript uses an
origin at the lower-left corner whereas X uses an origin at the
upper-left corner.
Canvas x coordinates can be used directly in Postscript without
transformation.
.PP
\fBTk_CanvasPsBitmap\fR generates Postscript to describe a region
of a bitmap.
The Postscript is generated in proper image data format for Postscript,
i.e., as data between angle brackets, one bit per pixel.
The Postscript is appended to \fIinterp->result\fR and TCL_OK is returned
unless an error occurs, in which case TCL_ERROR is returned and
\fIinterp->result\fR is overwritten with an error message.
.PP
\fBTk_CanvasPsColor\fR generates Postscript to set the current color
to correspond to its \fIcolorPtr\fR argument, taking into account any
color map specified in the \fBpostscript\fR command.
It appends the Postscript to \fIinterp->result\fR and returns
TCL_OK unless an error occurs, in which case TCL_ERROR is returned and
\fIinterp->result\fR is overwritten with an error message.
.PP
\fBTk_CanvasPsFont\fR generates Postscript that sets the current font
to match \fItkFont\fR as closely as possible.
\fBTk_CanvasPsFont\fR takes into account any font map specified
in the \fBpostscript\fR command, and it does
the best it can at mapping X fonts to Postscript fonts.
It appends the Postscript to \fIinterp->result\fR and returns TCL_OK
unless an error occurs, in which case TCL_ERROR is returned and
\fIinterp->result\fR is overwritten with an error message.
.PP
\fBTk_CanvasPsPath\fR generates Postscript to set the current path
to the set of points given by \fIcoordPtr\fR and \fInumPoints\fR.
It appends the resulting Postscript to \fIinterp->result\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_CanvasPsStipple\fR generates Postscript that will fill the
current path in stippled fashion.
It uses \fIbitmap\fR as the stipple pattern and the current Postscript
color;  ones in the stipple bitmap are drawn in the current color, and
zeroes are not drawn at all.
The Postscript is appended to \fIinterp->result\fR and TCL_OK is
returned, unless an error occurs, in which case TCL_ERROR is returned and
\fIinterp->result\fR is overwritten with an error message.
