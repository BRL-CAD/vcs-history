@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
Tk_Main \- main program for Tk-based applications
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_Main\fR(\fIargc, argv, appInitProc\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_AppInitProc *appInitProc
.AP int argc in
Number of elements in \fIargv\fR.
.AP char *argv[] in
Array of strings containing command-line arguments.
.AP Tcl_AppInitProc *appInitProc in
Address of an application-specific initialization procedure.
The value for this argument is usually \fBTcl_AppInit\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_Main\fR acts as the main program for most Tk-based applications.
Starting with Tk 4.0 it is not called \fBmain\fR anymore because it 
is part of the Tk library and having a function \fBmain\fR
in a library (particularly a shared library) causes problems on many
systems.
Having \fBmain\fR in the Tk library would also make it hard to use
Tk in C++ programs, since C++ programs must have special C++
\fBmain\fR functions.
.PP
Normally each application contains a small \fBmain\fR function that does
nothing but invoke \fBTk_Main\fR.
\fBTk_Main\fR then does all the work of creating and running a
\fBwish\fR-like application.
.PP
When it is has finished its own initialization, but before
it processes commands, \fBTk_Main\fR calls the procedure given by
the \fIappInitProc\fR argument.  This procedure provides a ``hook''
for the application to perform its own initialization, such as defining
application-specific commands.  The procedure must have an interface
that matches the type \fBTcl_AppInitProc\fR:
.CS
typedef int Tcl_AppInitProc(Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR);
.CE
\fIAppInitProc\fR is almost always a pointer to \fBTcl_AppInit\fR;
for more details on this procedure, see the documentation
for \fBTcl_AppInit\fR.

.SH KEYWORDS
application-specific initialization, command-line arguments, main program
