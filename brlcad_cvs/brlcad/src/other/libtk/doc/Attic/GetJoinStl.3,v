@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
Tk_GetJoinStyle, Tk_NameOfJoinStyle \- translate between strings and join styles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetJoinStyle(\fIinterp, string, joinPtr\fB)\fR
.sp
CONST char *
\fBTk_NameOfJoinStyle(\fIjoin\fB)\fR
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "Tcl_Interp" *joinPtr
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter to use for error reporting.
.AP "CONST char" *string in
String containing name of join style: one of ``bevel'', ``miter'',
or ``round''.
.AP int *joinPtr out
Pointer to location in which to store X join style corresponding to
\fIstring\fR.
.AP int join in
Join style: one of \fBJoinBevel\fR, \fBJoinMiter\fR, \fBJoinRound\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_GetJoinStyle\fR places in \fI*joinPtr\fR the X join style
corresponding to \fIstring\fR, which will be one of
\fBJoinBevel\fR, \fBJoinMiter\fR, or \fBJoinRound\fR.
Join styles are typically used in X graphics contexts to indicate
how adjacent line segments should be joined together.
See the X documentation for information on what each style
implies.
.PP
Under normal circumstances the return value is \fBTCL_OK\fR and
\fIinterp\fR is unused.
If \fIstring\fR doesn't contain a valid join style
or an abbreviation of one of these names, then an error message is
stored in \fIinterp->result\fR, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned, and
\fI*joinPtr\fR is unmodified.
.PP
\fBTk_NameOfJoinStyle\fR is the logical inverse of \fBTk_GetJoinStyle\fR.
Given a join style such as \fBJoinBevel\fR it returns a
statically-allocated string corresponding to \fIjoin\fR.
If \fIjoin\fR isn't a legal join style, then
``unknown join style'' is returned.

.SH KEYWORDS
bevel, join style, miter, round
