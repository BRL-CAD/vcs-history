@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS XSetWindowAttributes borderWidth
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window.
.AP "unsigned int" valueMask in
OR-ed mask of values like \fBCWX\fR or \fBCWBorderPixel\fR,
indicating which fields of \fI*valuePtr\fR or \fI*attsPtr\fR to use.
.AP XWindowChanges *valuePtr in
Points to a structure containing new values for the configuration
parameters selected by \fIvalueMask\fR.  Fields not selected
by \fIvalueMask\fR are ignored.
.AP int x in
New x-coordinate for \fItkwin\fR's top left pixel (including
border, if any) within tkwin's parent.
.AP int y in
New y-coordinate for \fItkwin\fR's top left pixel (including
border, if any) within tkwin's parent.
.AP "int" width in
New width for \fItkwin\fR (interior, not including border).
.AP "int" height in
New height for \fItkwin\fR (interior, not including border).
.AP "int" borderWidth in
New width for \fItkwin\fR's border.
.AP XSetWindowAttributes *attsPtr in
Points to a structure containing new values for the attributes
given by the \fIvalueMask\fR argument.  Attributes not selected
by \fIvalueMask\fR are ignored.
.AP "unsigned long" pixel in
New background or border color for window.
.AP Pixmap pixmap in
New pixmap to use for background or border of \fItkwin\fR.  WARNING:
cannot necessarily be deleted immediately, as for Xlib calls.  See
note below.
.AP Colormap colormap in
New colormap to use for \fItkwin\fR.
.AP Tk_Cursor cursor in
New cursor to use for \fItkwin\fR.  If \fBNone\fR is specified, then
\fItkwin\fR will not have its own cursor;  it will use the cursor
of its parent.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are analogous to the X library procedures
with similar names, such as \fBXConfigureWindow\fR.  Each
one of the above procedures calls the corresponding X procedure
and also saves the configuration information in Tk's local
structure for the window.  This allows the information to
be retrieved quickly by the application (using macros such
as \fBTk_X\fR and \fBTk_Height\fR) without having to contact
the X server.  In addition, if no X window has actually been
created for \fItkwin\fR yet, these procedures do not issue
X operations or cause event handlers to be invoked;  they save
the information in Tk's local
structure for the window;  when the window is created later,
the saved information will be used to configure the window.
.PP
See the X library documentation for details on what these
procedures do and how they use their arguments.
.PP
In the procedures \fBTk_ConfigureWindow\fR, \fBTk_MoveWindow\fR,
\fBTk_ResizeWindow\fR, \fBTk_MoveResizeWindow\fR, and
\fBTk_SetWindowBorderWidth\fR,
if \fItkwin\fR is an internal window then event handlers interested
in configure events are invoked immediately, before the procedure
returns.  If \fItkwin\fR is a top-level window
then the event handlers will be invoked later, after X has seen
the request and returned an event for it.
.PP
Applications using Tk should never call procedures like
\fBXConfigureWindow\fR directly;  they should always use the
corresponding Tk procedures.
.PP
The size and location of a window should only be modified by the
appropriate geometry manager for that window and never by a window
itself (but see \fBTk_MoveToplevelWindow\fR for moving a top-level
window).
.PP
You may not use \fBTk_ConfigureWindow\fR to change the
stacking order of a window (\fIvalueMask\fR may not contain the
\fBCWSibling\fR or \fBCWStackMode\fR bits).
To change the stacking order, use the procedure \fBTk_RestackWindow\fR.
.PP
The procedure \fBTk_SetWindowColormap\fR will automatically add
\fItkwin\fR to the \fBTK_COLORMAP_WINDOWS\fR property of its
nearest top-level ancestor if the new colormap is different from
that of \fItkwin\fR's parent and \fItkwin\fR isn't already in
the \fBTK_COLORMAP_WINDOWS\fR property.

.SH BUGS
.PP
\fBTk_SetWindowBackgroundPixmap\fR and \fBTk_SetWindowBorderPixmap\fR
differ slightly from their Xlib counterparts in that the \fIpixmap\fR
argument may not necessarily be deleted immediately after calling
one of these procedures.  This is because \fItkwin\fR's window
may not exist yet at the time of the call, in which case \fIpixmap\fR
is merely saved and used later when \fItkwin\fR's window is actually
created.  If you wish to delete \fIpixmap\fR, then call
\fBTk_MakeWindowExist\fR first to be sure that \fItkwin\fR's window exists
and \fIpixmap\fR has been passed to the X server.
.PP
A similar problem occurs for the \fIcursor\fR argument passed to
\fBTk_DefineCursor\fR.  The solution is the same as for pixmaps above:
call \fBTk_MakeWindowExist\fR before freeing the cursor.
