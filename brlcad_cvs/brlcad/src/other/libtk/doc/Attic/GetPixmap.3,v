@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.TH Tk_GetPixmap 3 4.0 Tk "Tk Library Procedures"

.SH NAME
Tk_GetPixmap, Tk_FreePixmap \- allocate and free pixmaps
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
Pixmap
\fBTk_GetPixmap(\fIdisplay, d, width, height, depth\fB)\fR
.sp
\fBTk_FreePixmap(\fIdisplay, pixmap\fB)\fR
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "Drawable" *pixelPtr
.AP Display *display in
X display for the pixmap.
.AP Drawable d in
Pixmap or window where the new pixmap will be used for drawing.
.AP "int" width in
Width of pixmap.
.AP "int" height in
Height of pixmap.
.AP "int" depth in
Number of bits per pixel in pixmap.
.AP Pixmap pixmap in
Pixmap to destroy.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are identical to the Xlib procedures \fBXCreatePixmap\fR
and \fBXFreePixmap\fR, except that they have extra code to manage X
resource identifiers so that identifiers for deleted pixmaps can be
reused in the future.
It is important for Tk applications to use these procedures rather
than \fBXCreatePixmap\fR and \fBXFreePixmap\fR;  otherwise long-running
applications may run out of resource identifiers.
.PP
\fBTk_GetPixmap\fR creates a pixmap suitable for drawing in \fId\fR,
with dimensions given by \fIwidth\fR, \fIheight\fR, and \fIdepth\fR,
and returns its identifier.
\fBTk_FreePixmap\fR destroys the pixmap given by \fIpixmap\fR and makes
its resource identifier available for reuse.

.SH KEYWORDS
pixmap, resource identifier
