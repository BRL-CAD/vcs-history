@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
tkerror \- Command invoked to process background errors
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtkerror \fImessage\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Note: as of Tk 4.1 the \fBtkerror\fR command has been renamed to
\fBbgerror\fR because the event loop (which is what usually invokes
it) is now part of Tcl.  For backward compatibility
the \fBbgerror\fR provided by the current Tk version still
tries to call \fBtkerror\fR if there is one (or an auto loadable one), 
so old script defining that error handler should still work, but you
should anyhow modify your scripts to use \fBbgerror\fR instead 
of \fBtkerror\fR because that support for the old name might vanish
in the near future. If that call fails, \fBbgerror\fR 
posts a dialog showing the error and offering to see the stack trace
to the user. If you want your own error management you should
directly override \fBbgerror\fR instead of \fBtkerror\fR.
Documentation for \fBbgerror\fR is available as part of Tcl's
documentation.
