@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
Tk_SetClass, Tk_Class \- set or retrieve a window's class
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_SetClass\fR(\fItkwin, class\fR)
.sp
Tk_Uid
\fBTk_Class\fR(\fItkwin\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window parent
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window.
.AP char *class in
New class name for window.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_SetClass\fR is called to associate a class with a particular
window.  The \fIclass\fR string identifies the type of the
window;  all windows with the same general class of behavior
(button, menu, etc.) should have the same class.  By
convention all class names start with a capital letter, and
there exists a Tcl command with the same name as
each class (except all in lower-case) which can be used to
create and manipulate windows of that class.
A window's class string is initialized to NULL
when the window is created.
.PP
For main windows, Tk automatically propagates the name and class
to the WM_CLASS property used by window managers.  This happens
either when a main window is actually created (e.g. in
\fBTk_MakeWindowExist\fR), or when \fBTk_SetClass\fR
is called, whichever occurs later.  If a main window has not been
assigned a class then Tk will not set the WM_CLASS property for
the window.
.PP
\fBTk_Class\fR is a macro that returns the
current value of \fItkwin\fR's class.  The value is returned
as a Tk_Uid, which may be used just like a string pointer but also has
the properties of a unique identifier (see the manual entry for
\fBTk_GetUid\fR for details).
If \fItkwin\fR has not yet been given a class, then
\fBTk_Class\fR will return NULL.

.SH KEYWORDS
class, unique identifier, window, window manager
