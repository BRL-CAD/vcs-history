@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

# ::tk_dialog:
#
# This procedure displays a dialog box, waits for a button in the dialog
# to be invoked, then returns the index of the selected button.  If the
# dialog somehow gets destroyed, -1 is returned.
#
# Arguments:
# w -		Window to use for dialog top-level.
# title -	Title to display in dialog's decorative frame.
# text -	Message to display in dialog.
# bitmap -	Bitmap to display in dialog (empty string means none).
# default -	Index of button that is to display the default ring
#		(-1 means none).
# args -	One or more strings to display in buttons across the
#		bottom of the dialog box.
