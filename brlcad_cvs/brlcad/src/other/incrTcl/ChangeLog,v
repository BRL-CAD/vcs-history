	tcltest being so powerful.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_objects.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_util.c:
	* itk/generic/itk_archetype.c:
	Now builds with 8.3 regarding CONST84 trims on some Tcl API calls.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	* itk/generic/itk_cmds.c:
	Because the Tcl_Namespace APIs in Tcl have moved to the public
	space in 8.5, the stub slots have shifted.  This now causes Itcl
	when built against 8.5 to core when loaded into 8.4.  What genius
	you developers!  The absolute first rule with Stubs is not to EVER
	move the slots, but now you did.  Previously, one could build Itcl
	against 8.4 and load into any core 8.1+.  Now we can't do this.
	Gee, thank you all for the support...

	Now, what we compile against is the lowest we can load
	into.. Sorry!  send heated complaints to tcl-core@@lists.sf.net

2003-12-17  davygrvy
	* itcl/generic/itcl.h:
	Use fancy STRINGIFY macros for version string.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_objects.c:
	Needed to fix usage of Itcl_DecodeScopedCommand as rCmdPtr always
	needs to be freed.

	Tcl_Obj plugged.  [Bug 738189]

	* itcl/generic/itclInt.decls:
	* itcl/generic/itclIntDecls.h:

	Itcl_DecodeScopedCommand now fixed.

	* itcl/generic/itclInt.h:

	* itcl/generic/itcl_ensemble.c:

	* itcl/generic/itcl_methods.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_objects.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_util.c:
	full brain dump.  All CONST issues fixed except for
	Itcl_DecodeScopedCommand.  Will address this next.

	* itcl/configure:
	* itcl/configure.in:
	* itk/configure:
	* itk/configure.in:
	Changed to propagate an initial CFLAGS value
	to the final definition. A TEA condition (SHARED_BUILD == 1)
	squashed it, causing it the build system to loose the
	+DAportable we specify for the AS PA-RISC2.2 build host. This is
	a problem for _all_ TEA and TEA 2 based configure files.

2002-10-15  hobbs
	* itcl/configure:    move the CFLAGS definition into
	* itcl/configure.in: TEA_ENABLE_SHARED and make it pick up the env

	577719, reported by Simon White <s_a_white@@users.sourceforge.net>.

	more install target fixes

	* itcl/generic/itclDecls.h:
	* itcl/generic/itclIntDecls.h:

	outside the hull is destroyed when the mega-widget
	is destroyed. Also check for case where one external

	* itk/generic/itk_archetype.c (ArchComponent, Itk_ArchCompDeleteCmd,
	Itk_CreateArchComponent, Itk_DelArchComponent): Save a copy
	of the window path name in the ArchComponent struct and use
	it in the Itk_ArchCompDeleteCmd method. The old code was
	invoking Tk_PathName(tkwin) on a Tk_Window which lead to
	a memory access on memory that has already been free'd
	when the widget was destroyed.
	* itk/library/itk.tcl (itk::remove_destroy_hook): Don't attempt
	to remove the widget binding if the widget has already been
	destroyed.

	optimized use of Tcl_Objs to remove the creation of new ones that ended

	* itk/win/pkgIndex.tcl:
	we'll auto gen these from the makefile

	* itcl/win/makefile.vc:

	* itcl/configure:
	* itcl/configure.in:
	* itk/configure:
	* itk/configure.in:
	patch #426203

	* itk/win/makefile.vc:
	Mostly working.  Not fully tested, but lots closer.

	* itk/win/makefile.vc:
	more closer, but not yet perfect.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_methods.c:
	Fix for Tcl_GetCommandName() now returning a CONST char *
	from the changes Kevein Kenny is doing to the HEAD tcl code.
	This hasn't been tested with older header files, yet.

	* itk/generic/itk_cmds.c:
	Removed old reference to external ItkStubs structure.
	Old cruft left from before Itk_InitStubs existed.

	* itcl/win/itcl.rc:
	* itcl/win/rc/itcl.rc:
	moving the resource script

	* itcl/win/rc/itcl.rc:

	fine.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_methods.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_util.c:
	removed #include "tclCompile.h"!  It wasn't needed.  Those source
	files made no reference to anything in it.

	* itk/win/makefile.vc:
	closer to perfection.

	* itk/win/rc/itk.rc:
	This is now the resource script for the dll.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_methods.c:
	whoops.. doh!

	* itk/win/dllEntryPoint.c:
	Stubs bug logic fix.  Same as itcl/win/dllEntryPoint.c.  This help
	build a debug version of itcl/itk from the standard tclstubXX.lib
	by removing the link requirement to msvcrt.lib which should never
	have been there.

	* itcl/win/makefile.vc:
	adapted for new location of itcl.rc

	* itk/win/rc/itk.rc:
	subtle changes to infere the correct filename and support more
	complete versioning info.

	* itcl/generic/itcl.h:
	* itk/generic/itk.h:
	changed RESOURCE_INCLUDED to RC_INVOKED. The windows resource
	compiler to preset to define this already.

	* itcl/generic/itclInt.decls:

	* itcl/generic/itcl_class.c:
	Fix for Itcl_ClassCmdResolver() not being of type
	Tcl_ResolveCmdProc with the CONST type added to param 2 in the
	lastest headers.  I haven't tested this with an older tcl.h yet.
	Hopefully, this won't get messy.

	* itcl/win/makefile.vc:
	small $(RCDIR) change.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_bicmds.c:
	patch #426207, contextNs ptr can be NULL in Itcl_BiInfoClassCmd

2001-05-18  andreas_kupries
	* itcl/generic/itcl_class.c:
	[Fix 227811] Check for any command with the given name, not only

2001-04-25  davygrvy
	* pkg.vc: moved the info about the iwidget version for makefile.vc

2001-04-18  davygrvy
	* itcl/win/dllEntryPoint.c:
	whoops...  removed C++ style comment from this .c file :)

2001-04-14  davygrvy

	* itcl/library/itcl.tcl: Patch ID #227860

	* rules.vc: added an rcs keyword

	* .cvsignore: just testing loginfo mailing...

	* .cvsignore: only making a change to see the history file get an
	entry...

2001-04-12  davygrvy
	* itcl/win/makefile.vc: progress is happening

2001-04-08  davygrvy
	* itcl/win/.cvsignore:
	* itk/win/.cvsignore:
	no need to have CVS bother itself with the build directories

	* itcl/win/makefile.vc:
	a large rewrite

	* makefile.vc:
	todays work progress.  I'm not done yet.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_ensemble.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_util.c:
	Added mutex locking around the ItclPreservedList global hash table.  This
	appears to be the only work needed to support multithreading.

	* config.vc:
	* pkg.vc:
	* rules.vc:
	new build files for VC++ compiles

	* .cvsignore:
	ignore MSVC++ project artifacts

2001-04-07  davygrvy
	* itcl/win/dllEntryPoint.c:
	a small windows specific fix against Tcl's Stubs library.

	* itcl/generic/itclInt.h:
	* itcl/generic/itclStubLib.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_class.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	* itcl/generic/itcl_ensemble.c:
	  Tcl's internal header, tclInt.h, in 8.4a2 got a small change in
	  the Command structure that needed 2 changes in Itcl to resolve.
	  1) #if/#else/#endif blocks added in itcl_class.c and
	  itc_ensemble.c allowing Itcl to compile. 2) added a global
	  variable called itclCompatFlags that's sets a flag in
	  Itcl_Init() that will modify the logic around access to
	  cmdPtr->flags/deleted.  This way, any core compile will yeild a
	  fully forward/backward compatible binary (correct logic set at
	  runtime).

2000-12-21  smithc
	* itk/win/makefile.vc: Patch #102914.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_ensemble.c: Patch #102774

2000-09-23  davidg
	* CHANGES: added a note about the 3.2 release

	* itcl/generic/itcl.h:
	  Itcl_InitStub prototype in itcl/generic/itcl.h was getting name
	  mangled by c++ compilers.  Fixed with an 'extern "C"'
	  appropriately applied.

2000-08-18  davidg
	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	Tcl_InitStubs was using the TCL_VERSION macro set by the
	tcl.h header.  Changed it to be "8.1" instead as it
	doesn't matter unless Itcl needs special/new features of
	the core it's header is from.  But it doesn't..  so hard
	code it for an 8.1 minimum.

2000-08-07  welch
	* itcl/Makefile.in:
	* itcl/generic/itcl.h:
	* itcl/generic/itclStubLib.c:
	Final iteration, really, on getting Itcl_StubInit
	correctly set up.

	* itk/generic/itk_cmds.c:
	Removed redundant definitions of itclStubsPtr and
	itclIntStubsPtr.

	* itcl/Makefile.in:
	Added Itcl_InitStubs to the main Itcl library as well as
	the stubs library for those applications (like Itk) that
	call Itcl_InitStub but are linked against the main
	library.

	6/26/00 (bug fix)
	  Fixed Itcl_ClassVarResolver so that the formal
	  parameters in a method/proc take precedence over class
	  data members.
	
	6/30/00 (bug fix)
	  Fixed all itcl/itk/iwidgets3.0.0 tests to run cleanly
	  with the new tcltest package.
	
	7/1/00 (bug fix)
	  Fixed "itk_component delete" so that the composite
	  option list is cleaned up whenever a component is
	  deleted.  For example, suppose a component is the sole
	  contributor of -font.  When that component is removed
	  via "itk_component delete", the -font option goes away
	  as well.  Also fixed the handling of the itk-delete-*
	  binding for the component.  When the component is
	  removed, the binding tag is also removed by
	  itk::remove_destroy_hook.
	
	7/5/00 (bug fix)
	  Fixed the check done during object creation to avoid
	  clobbering existing commands.  Previously, itcl would
	  look for any command-- in the local *and* global
	  namespace--that might be clobbered.  Now, it looks for
	  commands only in the local namespace, since those are
	  the only ones that could truly be clobbered.
	
	7/5/00 (cleanup)
	  Removed obsolete Makefile/configure files in the various
	  "unix" directories.  Makefiles and configure files now
	  reside one level above, in the standard TEA place.

	"::itk" namespace based on whether it already exists or not.
	These changes were necessary to facilitate the wrapper dictating
	where the [incr Tk] libraries are stored in a wrapped application
	via the variable '::itk::library".

d298 7

		Because the Tcl_Namespace APIs in Tcl have moved to the public space
		in 8.5, the stub slots have shifted.  This now causes Itcl when built against
		8.5 to core when loaded into 8.4.  What genius you developers!  The
		absolute first rule with Stubs is not to EVER move the slots, but now you did.
		Previously, one could build Itcl against 8.4 and load into any core 8.1+.  Now
		we can't do this.  Gee, thank you all for the support...

		  Tcl's internal header, tclInt.h, in 8.4a2 got a small change in the Command
		  structure that needed 2 changes in Itcl to resolve.  1) #if/#else/#endif blocks
		  added in itcl_class.c and itc_ensemble.c allowing Itcl to compile. 2) added
		  a global variable called itclCompatFlags that's sets a flag in Itcl_Init()
		  that will modify the logic around access to cmdPtr->flags/deleted.  This
		  way, any core compile will yeild a fully forward/backward compatible
		  binary (correct logic set at runtime).

		6/26/00 (bug fix)

		6/30/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed all itcl/itk/iwidgets3.0.0 tests to run cleanly with the new
		  tcltest package.

		7/1/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed "itk_component delete" so that the composite option list is
		  cleaned up whenever a component is deleted.  For example, suppose
		  a component is the sole contributor of -font.  When that component
		  is removed via "itk_component delete", the -font option goes away
		  as well.  Also fixed the handling of the itk-delete-* binding for
		  the component.  When the component is removed, the binding tag
		  is also removed by itk::remove_destroy_hook.

		7/5/00 (bug fix)
		  Fixed the check done during object creation to avoid clobbering
		  existing commands.  Previously, itcl would look for any command--
		  in the local *and* global namespace--that might be clobbered.
		  Now, it looks for commands only in the local namespace, since
		  those are the only ones that could truly be clobbered.

		7/5/00 (cleanup)
		  Removed obsolete Makefile/configure files in the various "unix"
		  directories.  Makefiles and configure files now reside one level
		  above, in the standard TEA place.

	* itcl/generic/itcl_parse.c:
		Duuuuhhhh....

		This is the patch from Mo Dejong regarding the Windows NT/95 crashing
		problem.  My previous checkin of itcl_parse.c did not include all of
		the patch - got in a hurry.  Disregard the compiler warning mentioned
		in my previous checkin.
d1461 4
a1464 4
		Patch by Mo Dejong to fix a Windows NT/95 crashing problem where you can
		build with debugging on, load the Itcl package, and press the X in the
		upper right corner.  Note that I'm unable to test this on Windows and
		that this patch introduces a compiler warning.

		Fixed bug when calling mkIndex.tcl for itk

		reduced amount of output from "make install" in iwidgets
d1543 2
a1544 2
		Removed Makefiles rules to regenerate the configure scripts.  This was
		causing problems when building on Windows and Unix simultaneoulsy.
a1546 5
	* Makefile.in:
		Added pkgIndex files for Iwidgets

		Top level Makefile should no longer loop endlessly if the configure went bad.

d1551 7
a1557 2
		configure scripts now look for tclsh82d.exe executable when searching
		for valid tcl interpreter.
d1564 3
a1566 3
		Look for tclsh82d.exe before tclsh82.exe.

		configure scripts for itcl and itk now use the tcl.m4 macro SC_PROG_TCLSH.
d1575 2
a1576 2
		configure now searches for tclsh82 shell in exec-prefix, then prefix, then
		relative to tclConfig.sh, then in the users path.
d1591 4
a1594 4
		TEA changes.  Itcl now uses the same Makefiles and configure scripts for
		both Windows and Unix.

		Note that static shells are not yet done in this TEA implementation.
d1598 16

	* itcl/generic/itcl_cmds.c:
	* itk/generic/itk_cmds.c:
		Fix the makefile and configure files, etc., for Unix
		in order to compile with Tcl/Tk 8.1 with stubs.

		Builds itclsh and itkwish properly.

d1631 4
a1634 1
		Fixed the use of Tcl & Tk stubs on Windows.
d1636 13
a1648 2
		Now the extra shells (itclsh31.exe and itkwish31.exe) are being
		created and run properly.
d1675 16
a1690 12
		Applied patches from David Gravereaux to update Itcl and Itk to
		use Tcl/Tk 8.1 stubs and provide it's own stubs interface, on
		Windows only.

		Changes have not been made to support I18N (if needed) or MT-safety.

		Version number has been changed to 3.1.0 (from 3.0.1) by
		David to coincide with the shift to Tcl/Tk 8.1.

		Building of itclsh31.exe and iwish31.exe have been disabled
		until someone else makes them work properly.  Test suites
		have been modified to work with tclsh81.exe instead.
d1694 2

		  or not.  These changes were necessary to facilitate the wrapper dictating
		  where the [incr Tk] libraries are stored in a wrapped application via the
