@Upgrade to itcl/itk 3.3
@
text
@=======================================================================
 Following is a list of notes describing things which might be
 fixed or changed in a future release of [incr Tcl]
=======================================================================

Handle this case more elegantly:

class Foo {
    constructor {args} {
        _init
    }
    proc _init {} {
        puts "once!"
        proc _init {} {}
    }
}
Foo #auto
Foo #auto


itcl "wish" list
------------------------------------------------------------------
- add virtual inheritance
- add "border" type to canvas widget
- add "validate" and "valid" commands for type validation
- add "unknownvar" and provide access to object data members: "obj.var"
- check namespace [info class] {...} as a replacement for "virtual"
- fix "auto_load_all" problem in Tcl-DP
  (Their implementation uses "info commands" to verify that a command
  has been successfully autoloaded, but absolute command names like
  "::iwidgets::fileselectiondialog" don't show up.)
- fix "auto_load" mechanism to be extensible like "unknown"
- fix Itcl_RegisterC() to support ClientData
- core dump with "cmdtrace" (tclX thing?)

- ideas from Nelson Macy:
  - add "delegate" keyword for inheritance via composition?
  - add "forward" keyword for implementing error handlers
  - add "get" code to public variables for "cget" access

- equivalent of constructor/destructor for classes
- protected/private recognized for constructor/destructor
- add something like Tk_CreateWidgetCommand() for widget developers


itcl documentation cleanup
------------------------------------------------------------------
- add "Finance: Trading Systems" to commercial uses of Itcl (Deshaw)
- update doc:  "config" code also gets invoked on startup for itk widgets
- update doc:  add to FAQ:  class with common array interacts with Tk widget

itcl "to do" list
------------------------------------------------------------------

- write "auto_load_all" proc for Tcl-DP

- bad errorInfo:
  > More specifically, the constructor for the class did the following:
  >
  >         set hull [info namespace tail $this]
  >         ::frame $hull
  >
  > One of the class variables had a configuration script:
  >
  >     public variable textvariable "" {
  >         if { $textvariable != "" } {
  >             regsub "\\(.*\\)" $textvariable "" global
  >             global ::$global
  >             trace variable $textvariable w "$hull adjust"
  >         }
  >     }

- add "@@body" in as many places as possible to support Tcl compiler

- check out itcl with Tix:
     lappend auto_path $env(TIX_LIBRARY)
     source "$env(IWIDGETS_LIBRARY)/init.iwidgets"

     iwidgets::Dialog ._Arcattributes -title "Code: Arc Annotations"
     -modality application

     set attrframe [._Arcattributes childsite]

     tixScrolledHList $attrframe.ports
     [$attrframe.ports subwidget hlist] configure -selectmode browse

     pack $attrframe.ports -expand yes -fill both -padx 10 -pady 10

     ._Arcattributes activate
