.SH NAME
linsert \- Insert elements into a list
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlinsert \fIlist index element \fR?\fIelement element ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command produces a new list from \fIlist\fR by inserting all of the
\fIelement\fR arguments just before the \fIindex\fR'th element of
\fIlist\fR.  Each \fIelement\fR argument will become a separate element of
the new list.  If \fIindex\fR is less than or equal to zero, then the new
elements are inserted at the beginning of the list.  
.VS 8.5
The interpretation of the \fIindex\fR value is the same as
for the command \fBstring index\fR, supporting simple index
arithmetic and indices relative to the end of the list.
.VE
.SH EXAMPLE
Putting some values into a list, first indexing from the start and
then indexing from the end, and then chaining them together:
.CS
set oldList {the fox jumps over the dog}
set midList [\fBlinsert\fR $oldList 1 quick]
set newList [\fBlinsert\fR $midList end-1 lazy]
# The old lists still exist though...
set newerList [\fBlinsert\fR [\fBlinsert\fR $oldList end-1 quick] 1 lazy]

1.1
log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
