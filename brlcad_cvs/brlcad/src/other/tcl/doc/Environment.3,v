.SH NAME
Tcl_PutEnv \- procedures to manipulate the environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_PutEnv\fR(\fIassignment\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "const char" *assignment
.AP "const char" *assignnment in
Info about environment variable in the format NAME=value.
The \fIassignment\fR argument is in the system encoding.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_PutEnv\fR sets an environment variable. The information is
passed in a single string of the form NAME=value.  This procedure is
intended to be a stand-in for the UNIX \fBputenv\fR system call. All
Tcl-based applications using \fBputenv\fR should redefine it to
\fBTcl_PutEnv\fR so that they will interface properly to the Tcl
runtime.

.SH KEYWORDS
environment, variable

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
