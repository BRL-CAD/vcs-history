.SH NAME
concat \- Join lists together
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconcat\fI \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command joins each of its arguments together with spaces after
trimming leading and trailing white-space from each of them.  If all the
arguments are lists, this has the same effect as concatenating them
into a single list.
It permits any number of arguments;
if no \fIarg\fRs are supplied, the result is an empty string.
.SH EXAMPLES
Although \fBconcat\fR will concatenate lists (so the command:
.CS
\fBconcat\fR a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
.CE
will return "\fBa b c d e f {g h}\fR" as its result), it will also
concatenate things that are not lists, and hence the command:
.CS
\fBconcat\fR " a b {c   " d "  e} f"
.CE
will return "\fBa b {c d e} f\fR" as its result.
.PP
Note that the concatenation does not remove spaces from the middle of
its arguments, so the command:
.CS
\fBconcat\fR "a   b   c" { d e f }
.CE
will return "\fBa   b   c d e f\fR" (i.e. with three spaces between
the \fBa\fR, the \fBb\fR and the \fBc\fR).

.SH "SEE ALSO"
append(n), eval(n)

1.1
log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
