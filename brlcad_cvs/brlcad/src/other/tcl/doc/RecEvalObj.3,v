.SH NAME
Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj \- save command on history list before evaluating
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR(\fIinterp, cmdPtr, flags\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter in which to evaluate command.
.AP Tcl_Obj *cmdPtr in
Points to a Tcl object containing a command (or sequence of commands)
to execute.
.AP int flags in
An OR'ed combination of flag bits.  \fBTCL_NO_EVAL\fR means record the
command but don't evaluate it.  \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR means evaluate
the command at global level instead of the current stack level.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR is invoked to record a command as an event
on the history list and then execute it using \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR
(or \fBTcl_GlobalEvalObj\fR if the \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR bit is set
in \fIflags\fR).
It returns a completion code such as \fBTCL_OK\fR just like \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR,
as well as a result object containing additional information
(a result value or error message)
that can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
If you don't want the command recorded on the history list then
you should invoke \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR instead of \fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR.
Normally \fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
allow the user to re-issue recently invoked commands.
If the \fIflags\fR argument contains the \fBTCL_NO_EVAL\fR bit then
the command is recorded without being evaluated.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
