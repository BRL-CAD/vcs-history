.SH NAME
global \- Access global variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBglobal \fIvarname \fR?\fIvarname ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command has no effect unless executed in the context of a proc body.
If the \fBglobal\fR command is executed in the context of a proc body, it
creates local variables linked to the corresponding global variables (and
therefore these variables are listed by info locals).
.PP
If \fIvarname\fR contains namespace qualifiers, the local variable's name is
the unqualified name of the global variable, as determined by the
\fBnamespace tail\fR command. 
.PP
\fIvarname\fR is always treated as the name of a variable, not an
array element.  An error is returned if the name looks like an array element,
such as \fBa(b)\fR.
.SH EXAMPLES
This procedure sets the namespace variable \fI::a::x\fR
.CS
proc reset {} {
    \fBglobal\fR a::x
    set x 0
}
.CE
.PP
This procedure accumulates the strings passed to it in a global
buffer, separated by newlines.  It is useful for situations when you
want to build a message piece-by-piece (as if with \fBputs\fR) but
send that full message in a single piece (e.g. over a connection
opened with \fBsocket\fR or as part of a counted HTTP response).
.CS
proc accum {string} {
    \fBglobal\fR accumulator
    append accumulator $string \\n
}
.CE

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
