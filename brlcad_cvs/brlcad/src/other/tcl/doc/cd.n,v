.SH NAME
cd \- Change working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcd \fR?\fIdirName\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Change the current working directory to \fIdirName\fR, or to the
home directory (as specified in the HOME environment variable) if
\fIdirName\fR is not given.
Returns an empty string.
Note that the current working directory is a per-process resource; the
\fBcd\fR command changes the working directory for all interpreters
and (in a threaded environment) all threads.
.SH EXAMPLES
Change to the home directory of the user \fBfred\fR:
.CS
\fBcd\fR ~fred
.CE
.PP
Change to the directory \fBlib\fR that is a sibling directory of the
current one:
.CS
\fBcd\fR ../lib
.CE

.SH "SEE ALSO"

1.1
log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
