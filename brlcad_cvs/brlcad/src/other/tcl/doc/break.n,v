.SH NAME
break \- Abort looping command
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbreak\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command is typically invoked inside the body of a looping command
such as \fBfor\fR or \fBforeach\fR or \fBwhile\fR.
It returns a \fBTCL_BREAK\fR code, which causes a break exception
to occur.
The exception causes the current script to be aborted
out to the innermost containing loop command, which then
aborts its execution and returns normally.
Break exceptions are also handled in a few other situations, such
as the \fBcatch\fR command, Tk event bindings, and the outermost
scripts of procedure bodies.
.SH EXAMPLE
Print a line for each of the integers from 0 to 5:
.CS
for {set x 0} {$x<10} {incr x} {
   if {$x > 5} {
      \fBbreak\fR
   }
   puts "x is $x"
}

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
