.SH NAME
incr \- Increment the value of a variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBincr \fIvarName \fR?\fIincrement\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Increments the value stored in the variable whose name is \fIvarName\fR.
The value of the variable must be an integer.
If \fIincrement\fR is supplied then its value (which must be an
integer) is added to the value of variable \fIvarName\fR;  otherwise
1 is added to \fIvarName\fR.
The new value is stored as a decimal string in variable \fIvarName\fR
and also returned as result.
.PP
.VS 8.5
Starting with the Tcl 8.5 release, the variable \fIvarName\fR passed
to \fBincr\fR may be unset, and in that case, it will be set to
the value \fIincrement\fR or to the default increment value of \fB1\fR.
.VE 8.5
.SH EXAMPLES
Add one to the contents of the variable \fIx\fR:
.CS
\fBincr\fR x
.CE
.PP
Add 42 to the contents of the variable \fIx\fR:
.CS
\fBincr\fR x 42
.CE
.PP
Add the contents of the variable \fIy\fR to the contents of the
variable \fIx\fR:
.CS
\fBincr\fR x $y
.CE
.PP
Add nothing at all to the variable \fIx\fR (often useful for checking
whether an argument to a procedure is actually integral and generating
an error if it is not):
.CS
\fBincr\fR x 0
.CE

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
