.SH NAME
Tcl_WrongNumArgs \- generate standard error message for wrong number of arguments
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTcl_WrongNumArgs\fR(\fIinterp, objc, objv, message\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "Tcl_Obj *const" *message
.AP Tcl_Interp interp in
Interpreter in which error will be reported: error message gets stored
in its result object.
.AP int objc in
Number of leading arguments from \fIobjv\fR to include in error
message.
.AP "Tcl_Obj *const" objv[] in
Arguments to command that had the wrong number of arguments.
.AP "const char" *message in
Additional error information to print after leading arguments
from \fIobjv\fR.  This typically gives the acceptable syntax
of the command.  This argument may be NULL.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_WrongNumArgs\fR is a utility procedure that is invoked by
command procedures when they discover that they have received the
wrong number of arguments.  \fBTcl_WrongNumArgs\fR generates a
standard error message and stores it in the result object of
\fIinterp\fR.  The message includes the \fIobjc\fR initial
elements of \fIobjv\fR plus \fImessage\fR.  For example, if
\fIobjv\fR consists of the values \fBfoo\fR and \fBbar\fR,
\fIobjc\fR is 1, and \fImessage\fR is ``\fBfileName count\fR''
then \fIinterp\fR's result object will be set to the following
string:
.CS
wrong # args: should be "foo fileName count"
.CE
If \fIobjc\fR is 2, the result will be set to the following string:
.CS
wrong # args: should be "foo bar fileName count"
.CE
\fIObjc\fR is usually 1, but may be 2 or more for commands like
\fBstring\fR and the Tk widget commands, which use the first argument
as a subcommand.  
.PP
Some of the objects in the \fIobjv\fR array may be abbreviations for
a subcommand.  The command
\fBTcl_GetIndexFromObj\fR will convert the abbreviated string object
into an \fIindexObject\fR.  If an error occurs in the parsing of the
subcommand we would like to use the full subcommand name rather than
the abbreviation.  If the \fBTcl_WrongNumArgs\fR command finds any
\fIindexObjects\fR in the \fIobjv\fR array it will use the full subcommand
name in the error message instead of the abbreviated name that was
originally passed in.  Using the above example, let us assume that
\fIbar\fR is actually an abbreviation for \fIbarfly\fR and the object
is now an indexObject because it was passed to
\fBTcl_GetIndexFromObj\fR.  In this case the error message would be:
.CS
wrong # args: should be "foo barfly fileName count"
.CE

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
