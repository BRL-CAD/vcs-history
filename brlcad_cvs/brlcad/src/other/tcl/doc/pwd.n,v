.SH NAME
pwd \- Return the absolute path of the current working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpwd\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns the absolute path name of the current working directory.
.SH EXAMPLE
Sometimes it is useful to change to a known directory when running
some external command using \fBexec\fR, but it is important to keep
the application usually running in the directory that it was started
in (unless the user specifies otherwise) since that minimizes user
confusion. The way to do this is to save the current directory while
the external command is being run:
.CS
set tarFile [file normalize somefile.tar]
set savedDir [\fBpwd\fR]
cd /tmp
exec tar -xf $tarFile
cd $savedDir
.CE
.SH "SEE ALSO"
file(n), cd(n), glob(n), filename(n)

.SH KEYWORDS

1.1
log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
