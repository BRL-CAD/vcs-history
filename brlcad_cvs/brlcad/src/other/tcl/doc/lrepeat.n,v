.SH NAME
lrepeat \- Build a list by repeating elements
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlrepeat \fInumber element1 \fR?\fIelement2 element3 ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBlrepeat\fR command creates a list of size \fInumber * number of
elements\fR by repeating \fInumber\fR times the sequence of elements
\fIelement1 element2 ...\fR.  \fInumber\fR must be a positive integer,
\fIelementn\fR can be any Tcl value.  Note that \fBlrepeat 1 arg ...\fR
is identical to \fBlist arg ...\fR, though the \fIarg\fR is required
with \fBlrepeat\fR.
.SH EXAMPLES
.CS
lrepeat 3 a  => a a a
lrepeat 3 [lrepeat 3 0] => {0 0 0} {0 0 0} {0 0 0}
lrepeat 3 a b c => a b c a b c a b c
lrepeat 3 [lrepeat 2 a] b c => {a a} b c {a a} b c {a a} b c

1.1
log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
