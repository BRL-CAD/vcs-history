.TH Tcl_PrintDouble 3 8.0 Tcl "Tcl Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Tcl_PrintDouble \- Convert floating value to string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTcl_PrintDouble\fR(\fIinterp, value, dst\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Before Tcl 8.0, the \fBtcl_precision\fR variable in this interpreter
controlled the conversion.  As of Tcl 8.0, this argument is ignored and
the conversion is controlled by the \fBtcl_precision\fR variable
that is now shared by all interpreters.
.AP double value in
Floating-point value to be converted.
.AP char *dst out
Where to store the string representing \fIvalue\fR.  Must have at
least \fBTCL_DOUBLE_SPACE\fR characters of storage.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_PrintDouble\fR generates a string that represents the value
of \fIvalue\fR and stores it in memory at the location given by
\fIdst\fR.  It uses \fB%g\fR format to generate the string, with one
special twist: the string is guaranteed to contain either
a ``.'' or an ``e'' so that it doesn't look like an integer.  Where
\fB%g\fR would generate an integer with no decimal point, \fBTcl_PrintDouble\fR
adds ``.0''.
.VS 8.5
.PP
If the \fBtcl_precision\fR value is non-zero, the result will have
precisely that many digits of significance.  If the value is zero
(the default), the result will have the fewest digits needed to
represent the number in such a way that \fBTcl_NewDoubleObj\fR
will generate the same number when presented with the given string.
IEEE semantics of rounding to even apply to the conversion.
.VE

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
