.SH NAME
source \- Evaluate a file or resource as a Tcl script
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsource \fIfileName\fR
.sp
.VS 8.5
\fBsource\fR \fB\-encoding \fIencodingName fileName\fR
.VE 8.5
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command takes the contents of the specified file or resource
and passes it to the Tcl interpreter as a text script.  The return
value from \fBsource\fR is the return value of the last command
executed in the script.  If an error occurs in evaluating the contents
of the script then the \fBsource\fR command will return that error.
If a \fBreturn\fR command is invoked from within the script then the
remainder of the file will be skipped and the \fBsource\fR command
will return normally with the result from the \fBreturn\fR command.
.PP
The end-of-file character for files is '\\32' (^Z) for all platforms.
The source command will read files up to this character.  This
restriction does not exist for the \fBread\fR or \fBgets\fR commands,
allowing for files containing code and data segments (scripted documents).
If you require a ``^Z'' in code for string comparison, you can use
``\\032'' or ``\\u001a'', which will be safely substituted by the Tcl
interpreter into ``^Z''.
.PP
.VS 8.5
The \fB-encoding\fR option is used to specify the encoding of
the data stored in \fIfileName\fR.  When the \fB-encoding\fR option
is omitted, the system encoding is assumed.
.VE 8.5
.SH EXAMPLE
Run the script in the file \fBfoo.tcl\fR and then the script in the
file \fBbar.tcl\fR:
.CS
\fBsource\fR foo.tcl
\fBsource\fR bar.tcl
.CE
Alternatively:
.CS
foreach scriptFile {foo.tcl bar.tcl} {
   \fBsource\fR $scriptFile
}
.CE

1.1
log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
