.SH NAME
time \- Time the execution of a script
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtime \fIscript\fR ?\fIcount\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command will call the Tcl interpreter \fIcount\fR
times to evaluate \fIscript\fR (or once if \fIcount\fR isn't
specified).  It will then return a string of the form
.CS
\fB503 microseconds per iteration\fR
.CE
which indicates the average amount of time required per iteration,
in microseconds.
Time is measured in elapsed time, not CPU time.
.SH EXAMPLE
Estimate how long it takes for a simple Tcl \fBfor\fR loop to count to
a thousand:
.CS
time {
    for {set i 0} {$i<1000} {incr i} {
        # empty body
    }
}
.CE

.SH "SEE ALSO"

1.1
log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
