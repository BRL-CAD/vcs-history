.SH NAME
flush \- Flush buffered output for a channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBflush \fIchannelId\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Flushes any output that has been buffered for \fIchannelId\fR.
.PP
\fIChannelId\fR must be an identifier for an open channel such as a
Tcl standard channel (\fBstdout\fR or \fBstderr\fR), the return
value from an invocation of \fBopen\fR or \fBsocket\fR, or the result
of a channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension.  The
channel must have been opened for writing.
.PP
If the channel is in blocking mode the command does not return until all the
buffered output has been flushed to the channel. If the channel is in
nonblocking mode, the command may return before all buffered output has been
flushed; the remainder will be flushed in the background as fast as the
underlying file or device is able to absorb it.
.SH EXAMPLE
Prompt for the user to type some information in on the console:
.CS
puts -nonewline "Please type your name: "
\fBflush\fR stdout
gets stdin name
puts "Hello there, $name!"
.CE

.SH "SEE ALSO"
file(n), open(n), socket(n), Tcl_StandardChannels(3)

.SH KEYWORDS
blocking, buffer, channel, flush, nonblocking, output

log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
