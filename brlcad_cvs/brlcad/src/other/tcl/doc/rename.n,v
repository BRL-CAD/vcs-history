.SH NAME
rename \- Rename or delete a command
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrename \fIoldName newName\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Rename the command that used to be called \fIoldName\fR so that it
is now called \fInewName\fR.
If \fInewName\fR is an empty string then \fIoldName\fR is deleted.
\fIoldName\fR and \fInewName\fR may include namespace qualifiers
(names of containing namespaces).
If a command is renamed into a different namespace,
future invocations of it will execute in the new namespace.
The \fBrename\fR command returns an empty string as result.
.SH EXAMPLE
The \fBrename\fR command can be used to wrap the standard Tcl commands
with your own monitoring machinery.  For example, you might wish to
count how often the \fBsource\fR command is called:
.CS
\fBrename\fR ::source ::theRealSource
set sourceCount 0
proc ::source args {
    global sourceCount
    puts "called source for the [incr sourceCount]'th time"
    uplevel 1 ::theRealSource $args
}
.CE

.SH "SEE ALSO"

log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
