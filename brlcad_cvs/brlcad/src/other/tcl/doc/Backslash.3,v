.SH NAME
Tcl_Backslash \- parse a backslash sequence
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
char
\fBTcl_Backslash\fR(\fIsrc, countPtr\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS char *countPtr out
.AP char *src in
Pointer to a string starting with a backslash.
.AP int *countPtr out
If \fIcountPtr\fR isn't NULL, \fI*countPtr\fR gets filled
in with number of characters in the backslash sequence, including
the backslash character.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The use of \fBTcl_Backslash\fR is deprecated in favor of
\fBTcl_UtfBackslash\fR.
.PP
This is a utility procedure provided for backwards compatibility with
non-internationalized Tcl extensions.  It parses a backslash sequence and
returns the low byte of the Unicode character corresponding to the sequence. 
\fBTcl_Backslash\fR modifies \fI*countPtr\fR to contain the number of
characters in the backslash sequence.
.PP
See the Tcl manual entry for information on the valid backslash sequences.
All of the sequences described in the Tcl manual entry are supported by
\fBTcl_Backslash\fR.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
Tcl(n), Tcl_UtfBackslash(3)

.SH KEYWORDS
backslash, parse

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
