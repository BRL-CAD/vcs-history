.SH NAME
Tcl_SetErrno, Tcl_GetErrno, Tcl_ErrnoId, Tcl_ErrnoMsg \- manipulate errno to store and retrieve error codes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR

\fBTcl_SetErrno\fR(\fIerrorCode\fR)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS int errorCode
.AP int errorCode in
A POSIX error code such as \fBENOENT\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_SetErrno\fR and \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR provide portable access
to the \fBerrno\fR variable, which is used to record a POSIX error
code after system calls and other operations such as \fBTcl_Gets\fR.
These procedures are necessary because global variable accesses cannot
be made across module boundaries on some platforms.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetErrno\fR sets the \fBerrno\fR variable to the value of the
\fIerrorCode\fR argument
C procedures that wish to return error information to their callers
via \fBerrno\fR should call \fBTcl_SetErrno\fR rather than setting
\fBerrno\fR directly.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetErrno\fR returns the current value of \fBerrno\fR.
Procedures wishing to access \fBerrno\fR should call this procedure
instead of accessing \fBerrno\fR directly.
.PP
\fBTcl_ErrnoId\fR and \fBTcl_ErrnoMsg\fR return string
representations of \fBerrno\fR values.  \fBTcl_ErrnoId\fR
returns a machine-readable textual identifier such as
"EACCES" that corresponds to the current value of \fBerrno\fR.
\fBTcl_ErrnoMsg\fR returns a human-readable string such as
"permission denied" that corresponds to the value of its
\fIerrorCode\fR argument.  The \fIerrorCode\fR argument is
typically the value returned by \fBTcl_GetErrno\fR.
The strings returned by these functions are
statically allocated and the caller must not free or modify them.

.SH KEYWORDS
errno, error code, global variables

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
