.SH NAME
Tcl_SetRecursionLimit \- set maximum allowable nesting depth in interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR(\fIinterp, depth\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter whose recursion limit is to be set.
Must be greater than zero.
.AP int depth in
New limit for nested calls to \fBTcl_Eval\fR for \fIinterp\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
At any given time Tcl enforces a limit on the number of recursive
calls that may be active for \fBTcl_Eval\fR and related procedures
such as \fBTcl_GlobalEval\fR.
Any call to \fBTcl_Eval\fR that exceeds this depth is aborted with
an error.
By default the recursion limit is 1000.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR may be used to change the maximum
allowable nesting depth for an interpreter.
The \fIdepth\fR argument specifies a new limit for \fIinterp\fR,
and \fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR returns the old limit.
To read out the old limit without modifying it, invoke
\fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR with \fIdepth\fR equal to 0.
.PP
The \fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR only sets the size of the Tcl
call stack:  it cannot by itself prevent stack overflows on the
C stack being used by the application.  If your machine has a
limit on the size of the C stack, you may get stack overflows
before reaching the limit set by \fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR.
If this happens, see if there is a mechanism in your system for
increasing the maximum size of the C stack.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
