.SH NAME
Tcl_StaticPackage \- make a statically linked package available via the `load' command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTcl_StaticPackage\fR(\fIinterp, pkgName, initProc, safeInitProc\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_PackageInitProc *safeInitProc
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
If not NULL, points to an interpreter into which the package has
already been loaded (i.e., the caller has already invoked the
appropriate initialization procedure).  NULL means the package
hasn't yet been incorporated into any interpreter.
.AP "const char" *pkgName in
Name of the package;  should be properly capitalized (first letter
upper-case, all others lower-case).
.AP Tcl_PackageInitProc *initProc in
Procedure to invoke to incorporate this package into a trusted
interpreter.
.AP Tcl_PackageInitProc *safeInitProc in
Procedure to call to incorporate this package into a safe interpreter
(one that will execute untrusted scripts).   NULL means the package
can't be used in safe interpreters.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure may be invoked to announce that a package has been
linked statically with a Tcl application and, optionally, that it
has already been loaded into an interpreter.
Once \fBTcl_StaticPackage\fR has been invoked for a package, it
may be loaded into interpreters using the \fBload\fR command.
\fBTcl_StaticPackage\fR is normally invoked only by the \fBTcl_AppInit\fR
procedure for the application, not by packages for themselves
(\fBTcl_StaticPackage\fR should only be invoked for statically
loaded packages, and code in the package itself should not need
to know whether the package is dynamically or statically loaded).
.PP
When the \fBload\fR command is used later to load the package into
an interpreter, one of \fIinitProc\fR and \fIsafeInitProc\fR will
be invoked, depending on whether the target interpreter is safe
or not.
\fIinitProc\fR and \fIsafeInitProc\fR must both match the
following prototype:
.CS
typedef int Tcl_PackageInitProc(Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR);
.CE
The \fIinterp\fR argument identifies the interpreter in which the package
is to be loaded.  The initialization procedure must return \fBTCL_OK\fR or
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR to indicate whether or not it completed successfully; in
the event of an error it should set the interpreter's result to point to an
error message.  The result or error from the initialization procedure will
be returned as the result of the \fBload\fR command that caused the
initialization procedure to be invoked.

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
