.SH NAME
Tcl_CreateCloseHandler, Tcl_DeleteCloseHandler \- arrange for callbacks when channels are closed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
void
\fBTcl_CreateCloseHandler\fR(\fIchannel, proc, clientData\fR)
.sp
void
\fBTcl_DeleteCloseHandler\fR(\fIchannel, proc, clientData\fR)
.sp
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_CloseProc clientData
.AP Tcl_Channel channel in
The channel for which to create or delete a close callback.
.AP Tcl_CloseProc *proc in
The procedure to call as the callback.
.AP ClientData clientData in
Arbitrary one-word value to pass to \fIproc\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateCloseHandler\fR arranges for \fIproc\fR to be called when
\fIchannel\fR is closed with \fBTcl_Close\fR or
\fBTcl_UnregisterChannel\fR, or using the Tcl \fBclose\fR command.
\fIProc\fR should match the following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef void Tcl_CloseProc(
        ClientData \fIclientData\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIclientData\fR is the same as the value provided in the call to
\fBTcl_CreateCloseHandler\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_DeleteCloseHandler\fR removes a close callback for \fIchannel\fR.
The \fIproc\fR and \fIclientData\fR identify which close callback to
remove; \fBTcl_DeleteCloseHandler\fR does nothing if its \fIproc\fR and
\fIclientData\fR arguments do not match the \fIproc\fR and \fIclientData\fR
for a  close handler for \fIchannel\fR.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
close(n), Tcl_Close(3), Tcl_UnregisterChannel(3)

.SH KEYWORDS
callback, channel closing

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
