.SH NAME
lrange \- Return one or more adjacent elements from a list
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlrange \fIlist first last\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIList\fR must be a valid Tcl list.  This command will
return a new list consisting of elements
\fIfirst\fR through \fIlast\fR, inclusive.
.VS 8.5
The index values \fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR are interpreted
the same as index values for the command \fBstring index\fR,
supporting simple index arithmetic and indices relative to the
end of the list.
.VE
If \fIfirst\fR is less than zero, it is treated as if it were zero.
If \fIlast\fR is greater than or equal to the number of elements
in the list, then it is treated as if it were \fBend\fR.
If \fIfirst\fR is greater than \fIlast\fR then an empty string
is returned.
Note: ``\fBlrange \fIlist first first\fR'' does not always produce the
same result as ``\fBlindex \fIlist first\fR'' (although it often does
for simple fields that aren't enclosed in braces); it does, however,
produce exactly the same results as ``\fBlist [lindex \fIlist first\fB]\fR''
.SH EXAMPLES
Selecting the first two elements:
.CS
% \fBlrange\fR {a b c d e} 0 1
a b
.CE
.PP
Selecting the last three elements:
.CS
% \fBlrange\fR {a b c d e} end-2 end
c d e
.CE
.PP
Selecting everything except the first and last element:
.CS
% \fBlrange\fR {a b c d e} 1 end-1
b c d
.CE
.PP
Selecting a single element with \fBlrange\fR is not the same as doing
so with \fBlindex\fR:
.CS
% set var {some {elements to} select}
some {elements to} select
% lindex $var 1
elements to
% \fBlrange\fR $var 1 1
{elements to}
.CE

@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
