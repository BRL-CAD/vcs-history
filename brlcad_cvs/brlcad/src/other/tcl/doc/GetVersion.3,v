.SH NAME
Tcl_GetVersion \- get the version of the library at runtime
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTcl_GetVersion\fR(\fImajor, minor, patchLevel, type\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_ReleaseType *patchLevel out
.AP int *major out
Major version number of the Tcl library.
.AP int *minor out
Minor version number of the Tcl library.
.AP int *patchLevel out
The patch level of the Tcl library (or alpha or beta number).
.AP Tcl_ReleaseType *type out
The type of release, also indicates the type of patch level. Can be
one of \fBTCL_ALPHA_RELEASE\fR, \fBTCL_BETA_RELEASE\fR, or 
\fBTCL_FINAL_RELEASE\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_GetVersion\fR should be used to query the version number
of the Tcl library at runtime.  This is useful when using a 
dynamically loaded Tcl library or when writing a stubs-aware
extension.  For instance, if you write an extension that is
linked against the Tcl stubs library, it could be loaded into
a program linked to an older version of Tcl than you expected.
Use \fBTcl_GetVersion\fR to verify that fact, and possibly to
change the behavior of your extension.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetVersion\fR accepts NULL for any of the arguments. For instance if 
you do not care about the \fIpatchLevel\fR of the library, pass
a NULL for the \fIpatchLevel\fR argument.

.SH KEYWORDS
version, patchlevel, major, minor, alpha, beta, release

log
@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.
