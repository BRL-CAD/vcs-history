@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

@This directory contains unsupported tools used to build parts of Tcl
for distribution.


uniParse.tcl -- Script for converting the Unicode character database
	into a compact table stored in generic/tclUniData.c.

uniClass.tcl -- Script for generating regexp class tables from the Tcl
	"string is" classes

Generating HTML files.
The tcl-tk-man-html.tcl script from Robert Critchlow
generates a nice set of HTML with good cross references.
Use it like
    tclsh tcl-tk-man-html.tcl --htmldir=/tmp/tcl8.2
This script is very picky about the organization of man pages,
effectively acting as a style enforcer.

Generating Windows Help Files:
1) Build tcl in the ../unix directory
2) On UNIX, (after autoconf and configure), do
	make
    this converts the Nroff to RTF files.
2) On Windows, convert the RTF to a Help doc, do
	nmake helpfile

Generating Windows binary distribution.
Update and compile the WYSE tcl.wse configuration.
