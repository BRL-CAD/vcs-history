 * $Log: colorquant.c,v $
 * Revision 14.2  2005/01/23 14:29:55  brlcad
 * update from a patched 3.0 to urt 3.1b1 (library)
 *
 * Revision 3.0.1.4  1992/04/30  14:06:48  spencer
 * patch3: lint fixes.
 *
 * Revision 3.0.1.3  1991/02/06  16:46:47  spencer
 * patch3: Fix round-off error in variance calculation that sometimes
 * patch3: caused multiple boxes with the same center to be cut.
 * patch3: Change 'fast' argument to 'flags' argument.  Currently:
 * patch3: 	CQ_FAST: same as old fast argument
 * patch3: 	CQ_QUANTIZE: data is not prequantized to bits
 * patch3: 	CQ_NO_RGBMAP: don't build rgbmap.
 *
 * Revision 3.0.1.2  90/11/29  15:18:04  spencer
 * Remove a typo.
 * 
 *
 * Revision 3.0.1.1  90/11/19  16:59:48  spencer
 * Use inv_cmap instead of find_colors.
 * Changes to process multiple files into one colormap (accum_hist arg).
 * Delete 'otherimages' argument -- unnecessary with faster inv_cmap code.
 *
 *
 * Revision 3.0  90/08/03  15:20:11  spencer
 * Establish version 3.0 base.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  90/07/29  08:06:06  spencer
 * If HUGE isn't defined, make it HUGE_VAL (for ansi).
 *
 * Revision 1.5  90/07/26  17:25:48  rgb
 * Added a parameter to colorquant for rgbmap construction.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  90/07/13  14:53:31  spencer
 * Get rid of ARB_ARG sh*t.
 * Change a couple of vars to double so that HUGE won't cause problems.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  90/06/28  21:42:56  spencer
 * Declare internal functions properly.
 * Delete unused global variable.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  90/06/28  13:18:56  spencer
 * Make internal functions static.
 * Build entire RGB cube, not just those colors used by this image.  This
 * is so dithering will work.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  90/06/18  20:45:17  spencer
 * Initial revision
 *
 * Revision 1.3  89/12/03  18:27:16  craig
 * Removed bogus integer casts in distance calculation in makenearest().
 *
 * Revision 1.2  89/12/03  18:13:12  craig
 * FindCutpoint now returns FALSE if the given box cannot be cut.  This
 * to avoid overflow problems in CutBox.
 * "whichbox" in GreatestVariance() is now initialized to 0.
 *

 * Although I've tried to avoid integer overflow problems where ever possible,
 * it's likely I've missed a spot where an 'int' should really be a 'long'.
 * (On the machine this was developed on, an int == long == 32 bits.)
 *
 * Note that it's quite easy to optimize this code for a given value for
 * 'bits'.  In addition, if you assume bits is small and
 * that the total number of pixels is relatively small, there are several
 * places that integer arithmetic may be substituted for floating-point.
 * One such place is the loop in BoxStats -- mean and var need not necessary
 * be floats.
 *
 * As things stand, the maximum number of colors to which an image may
 * be quantized is 256.  This limit may be overcome by changing rgbmap and
 * colormap from pointers to characters to pointers to something larger.

 * Input consists of:
 *	red, green, blue	Arrays of red, green and blue pixel
 *				intensities stored as unsigned characters.
 *				The color of the ith pixel is given
 *				by red[i] green[i] and blue[i].  0 indicates
 *				zero intensity, 255 full intensity.
 *	pixels			The length of the red, green and blue arrays
 *				in bytes, stored as an unsigned long int.
 *	colormap		Points to the colormap.  The colormap
 *				consists of red, green and blue arrays.
 *				The red/green/blue values of the ith
 *				colormap entry are given respectively by
 *				colormap[0][i], colormap[1][i] and
 *				colormap[2][i].  Each entry is an unsigned char.
 *	colors			The number of colormap entries, stored
 *				as an integer.
 *	bits			The number of significant bits in each entry
 *				of the red, greena and blue arrays. An integer.
 *	rgbmap			An array of unsigned chars of size (2^bits)^3.
 *				This array is used to map from pixels to
 *				colormap entries.  The 'prequantized' red,
 *				green and blue components of a pixel
 *				are used as an index into rgbmap to retrieve
 *				the index which should be used into the colormap
 *				to represent the pixel.  In short:
 *				index = rgbmap[(((r << bits) | g) << bits) | b];
 * 	flags			A set of bit-flags:
 * 		CQ_FAST		If set, the rgbmap will be constructed
 *				quickly.  If not set, the rgbmap will
 *				be built more slowly, but more
 *				accurately.  In most cases, fast
 *				should be set, as the error introduced
 *				by the approximation is usually small.
 * 		CQ_QUANTIZE:	If set, the data in red, green, and
 * 				blue is not pre-quantized, and will be
 * 				quantized "on the fly".  This slows
 * 				the routine slightly.  If not set, the
 * 				data has been prequantized to 'bits'
 * 				significant bits.
 *
 *	accum_hist		If non-zero the histogram will accumulate and
 *				reflect pixels from multiple images.
 *				when 1, the histogram will be initialized and
 *				summed, but not thrown away OR processed. when
 *				2 the image RGB will be added to it.  When 3
 *				Boxes are cut and a colormap and rgbmap
 *				are be returned, Histogram is freed too.
 *				When zero, all code is executed as per normal.
 *
 * colorquant returns the number of colors to which the image was
 * quantized.
