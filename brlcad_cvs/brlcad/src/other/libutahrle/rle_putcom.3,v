.IR rle_putcom .

.I Rle_getcom
returns a pointer to the data portion of a picture comment from an RLE file.
The comment is assumed to be in the form
.IR name=value ;
a pointer to
.I value
is returned.  If the comment is of the form
.IR name ,

.I NULL
pointer is returned.
The
.I the_hdr
structure contains the picture comments in question.

.IR rle_hdr (3)
