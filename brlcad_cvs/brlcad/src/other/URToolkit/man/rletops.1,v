.SH NAME
rletops \- Convert RLE images to PostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rletops

.B \-C
] [
.B \-a
.I aspect
] [
.B \-c
.I center

.B \-h

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR Rletops
converts
.IR RLE (5)
images into
.IR PostScript .
The conversion uses the
.I PostScript
.B image
operator, instructing the device to reproduce the image to the best of its
abilities.  If
.I infile
isn't specified, the RLE image is read from stdin.  The PostScript output is
dumped to stdout, or to
.I outfile.ps,
if specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fB\-a\ \fIaspect\fR
Specify aspect ratio of image.  Default is 1.0 (note PostScript uses square
pixels).
.TP
.B \-C
Causes a color PostScript image to be generated.
This creates larger files and uses the PostScript
.B colorimage
operator, which is not recognized by all devices.
The default is monochrome.
.TP
.B \fB\-c\ \fIcenter\fR
Centers the images about a point
.I center
inches from the left edge of the page (or left margin if
.B \-s
is specified).  Default is 4.25 inches.
.TP
.B \fB\-h\ \fIheight\fR
Specifies the height (in inches) the image is to appear on the page.  The
default is three inches.  The width of the image is calculated from
the image height, aspect ratio, and pixel dimensions.
.TP
.B \-s
Specifies image is to be generated in "Scribe Mode."  The image is generated
without a PostScript
.I showpage
operator at the end, and the default image center is changed to 3.25 inches
from the margin (which usually is 1 inch).
This is to generate PostScript files that can be included in Scribe documents
with the @@Picture command.  Images may also be included in LaTex documents
with local conventions like the \\special{psfile=image.ps} command.
.SH NOTES
On devices like the Apple LaserWriter,
.I rletops
generates large PostScript files that take a non-trivial amount of time
to download and print.  A 512x512 image takes about ten minutes.
For including images in documents at the default sizes, 256x256 is
usually sufficient resolution.
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR avg4 (1),
.IR urt (1),
.IR RLE (5).
.SH AUTHORS
Rod Bogart, John W. Peterson, Gregg Townsend.

Portions are based on a program by Marc Majka.
.SH BUGS
Due to a mis-understanding with the PostScript interpreter,
.I rletops
always rounds the image size up to an even number of scanlines.
