.SH NAME
rlenoise \- Add random noise to an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rlenoise
[
.B \-n
.I amount
] [
.B \-o
.I outfile
] [
.I infile
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rlenoise
adds uniform random noise to an image.  The peak-to-peak amplitude of
the noise can be specified with the
.B \-n
flag, the default value is 4.  This program may be
useful for trying to deal with quantization in an output device, if
you are able to trade spatial resolution for color resolution, and you
don't have a good characterization of the quantization function.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I infile
The input will be read from this file, otherwise, input will
be taken from stdin.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
If specified, output will be written to this file, otherwise it will
go to stdout.
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR urt (1),
.IR RLE (5).
.SH AUTHOR
Spencer W. Thomas, University of Michigan.
.SH BUGS
Of limited utility.
