.SH NAME
rlebox \- print bounding box for image in an RLE file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rlebox
[
.B \-c
] [
.B \-m
.I margin
] [
.B \-v
] [
.I infile
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program prints the bounding box for the image portion of an
.IR RLE (5)
file.  This is distinct from the bounds in the file header, since it
is computed solely on the basis of the actual image.  All background
pixels are ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Print the numbers in the order that crop wants them on its command
line.  The default order is
.IR "xmin xmax ymin ymax" .
If this option is specified, the bounds are printed in the order
.IR "xmin ymin xmax ymax" .
Thus, a file
.I foo.rle
could be trimmed to the smallest possible image by the command
.nf
.ta 1i
	crop `rlebox \-c foo.rle` foo.rle
.fi
.TP
.BI \-m " margin"
Pads the output values by the margin given.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode: label the numbers for human consumption.
.TP
.I infile
Name of the
.I RLE
file (defaults to standard input).
