.TH RLEADDCOM 1 2/2/87 1
.UC 4
.SH NAME
rleaddcom \- add picture comments to an RLE file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
rleaddcom
[
.B \-d
] [
.B \-i
] [
.B \-o
.I outfile
]
.I infile
.I comments
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I rleaddcom
program will add one or more comments to an
.IR RLE (5)
file.  If
.I infile
is "\-", it will read from the standard input.  The modified
.IR RLE (5)
file is written to the standard output if the
.B \-o
.I outfile
option is not given.  All remaining arguments on
the command line are taken as comments.  Comments are nominally of the
form
.I name=value
or
.IR name .
Any comment already in the file with the same
.I name
will be replaced.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Will cause matching comments to be deleted, no comments will be added
in this case.
.TP
.B \-i
"In place."  The input file will be rewritten with the added comments.
This argument requires write permission to the directory containing
.IR infile ,
but does not require write permission for
.IR infile .
Of the special file name cases described in
.IR urt (1),
only compressed files may be updated in place.  (It doesn't make sense
to update the output of a pipe "in place", does it?)

If
.BI  \-o " outfile"
is specified together with
.BR \-i ,
then
.I outfile
will not be modified until \fIrleaddcom\fP has finished (this is
similar to the way that
.IR into (1)
works).
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR into (1),
.IR rlehdr (1),
.IR urt (1),
.IR RLE (5).
