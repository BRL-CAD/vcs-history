the input file will be copied.  The program is not normally compiled
and installed, it exists solely to serve as a starting point for
writing simple "filter" tools, just as this man page serves as a starting
point for the documentation of simple tools.
.SH OPTIONS

If specified, the output will be written to this file.  If
.I outfile
is "\-", or if it is not specified, the output will be written to the
standard output stream.
.TP
.I infile
The input will be read from this file.  If
.I infile
is "\-" or is not specified, the input will be read from the standard
input stream.
