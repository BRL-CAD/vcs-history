.SH NAME
rlesplit \- split a file of concatenated RLE images into separate image files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rlesplit
[
.B \-n
.I number
[ 
.I digits
] ] [
.B \-o
.I prefix
] [ 
.I infile
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program will split a file containing a concatenated sequence of
.IR RLE (5)
images into separate files, each containing a single image.  The
output file names will be constructed from the input file name or a
specified prefix, and a sequence number.  If an input
.I infile
is specified, then the output file names will be in the form
"\fIrlefileroot\fP.\fI#\fP.rle",
where
.I rlefileroot
is 
.I infile
with any ".rle" suffix stripped off.  If the option
.BI \-o " prefix"
is specified, then the output file names will be of the form
"\fIprefix\fP.\fI#\fP.rle".
If neither option is given, then the output file names will be in the
form "\fI#\fP.rle".
Input will be read from
.I infile
if specified, from standard input, otherwise.  File names will be
printed on the standard error output as they are generated.

The option
.B \-n
allows specification of an initial sequence number, and optionally the
number of digits used for the sequence number.  By default, numbering
starts at 1, and numbers are printed with 3 digits (and leading zeros).
