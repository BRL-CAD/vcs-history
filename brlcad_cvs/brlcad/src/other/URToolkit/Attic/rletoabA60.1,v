.SH DESCRIPTION
This program converts an

file to a yuv byte file suitable for display on an Abekas A60.
Typically the yuv file is then rcp'd to the Abekas for display.
By default
.I rletoabA60
will attempt to place the image according to the placement values in
the image header.  If the image is to large to fit in the Abekas format
(720x486), the portion of the image extending off the edge will be
cropped.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI \-P " x y"

.LP

can be specified.
