// be wide enough to index into large arrays.  It defaults to an
// "int", but can be overriden at compile time redefining TNT_SUBSCRIPT_TYPE,
// e.g.
//
//      c++ -DTNT_SUBSCRIPT_TYPE='unsigned int'  ...

@add the NIST template numerics toolkit (TNT) for more involved matrix manipulations that libbn doesn't cover.  TNT is a replacement for LAPACK++.  Said matrix manipulations are needed for BREP manipulation.
