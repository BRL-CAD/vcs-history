</pre><HR>
</pre><H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
The <B>tabnotebook</B> command creates a new window (given by the pathName
argument) and makes it into a <B>tabnotebook</B> widget. Additional options,
described above may be specified on the command line or in the option
database to configure aspects of the tabnotebook such as its colors, font,
and text. The tabnotebook command returns its pathName argument. At the
time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.
<P>
A <B>tabnotebook</B> is a widget that contains a set of tabbed pages. It
displays one page from the set as the selected page. A Tab displays the
label for the page to which it is attached and serves as a page
selector. When a page's tab is selected, the page's contents are displayed
in the page area. The selected tab has a three-dimensional effect to make
it appear to float above the other tabs. The tabs are displayed as a group
along either the left, top, right, or bottom edge. When first created a
tabnotebook has no pages. Pages may be added or deleted using widget
commands described below.
<P>
A special option may be provided to the tabnotebook. The <B>-auto</B>
option specifies whether the tabnotebook will automatically handle the
unpacking and packing of pages when pages are selected. A value of
true signifies that the notebook will automatically manage it. This is the
default value. A value of false signifies the notebook will not perform
automatic switching of pages.
</pre><H2>NOTEBOOK PAGES</H2>
A tabnotebook's pages area contains a single child site frame. When a
new page is created it is a child of this frame. The page's child site
frame serves as a geometry container for applications to pack widgets
into. It is this frame that is automatically unpacked or packed when
the auto option is true. This creates the effect of one page being visible
at a time. When a new page is selected, the previously selected page's
child site frame is automatically unpacked from the tabnotebook's child
site frame and the newly selected page's child site is packed into the
tabnotebook's child site frame.
<P>
However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in a different
manner. By specifying the <B>auto</B> option as <B>false</B>, child site
packing can be disabled and done differently. For example, all widgets
might be packed into the first page's child site <B>frame</B>. Then when
a new page is selected, the application can reconfigure the widgets
and give the appearance that the page was flipped.
<P>
In both cases the command option for a page specifies a Tcl Command
to execute when the page is selected. In the case of <B>auto</B>
being <B>true</B>, it is between the unpacking of the previously selected
page and the packing of the newly selected page.
<P>
Notebook pages can also be controlled with scroll bars or other widgets
that obey the <B>scrollcommand</B> protocol. By giving a scrollbar
a <B>-command</B> to call the tabnotebook's <B>select</B> method, the
tabnotebook can be controlled with a scrollbar.
<P>
The notebook area is implemented with the notebook mega widget.
</pre><H2>TABS</H2>
Tabs appear along the edge of the notebook area. Tabs are drawn to appear
attached to their associated page. When a tab is clicked on, the associated
page is selected and the tab is drawn as raised above all other tabs and as
a seamless part of its notebook page. Tabs can be controlled in their
location along the edges, the angle tab sides are drawn with, gap between
tabs, starting margin of tabs, internal padding around text labels in
a tab, the font, and its label.
<P>
The Tab area is implemented with the <B>tabset</B> mega widget.
See <B>tabset(1)</B>. Tabs may be oriented along either the north, south,
east, or west sides with the <B>tabPos</B> option. North and south tabs
may appear as angled, square, or bevelled. West and east tabs may appear
as square or bevelled. By changing tab gaps, tab angles, bevelling,
orientations, colors, fonts, start locations, and margins; tabs may appear
in a wide variety of styles. For example, it is possible to implement
Microsoft-style tabs, Borland property tab styles, or Borland Delphi
style tabs all with the same tabnotebook.
</pre><H2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS</H2>
<P>
The <B>tabnotebook</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose name
is <I>pathName</I>. This command may be used to invoke various operations
on the widget. It has the following general form:
<pre>
<I>pathName option </I>?<I>arg arg ...</I>?
</pre>
<I>option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s
determine the exact behavior of the command.
<P>
Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument an
indicator of which page of the notebook to operate on. These indicators are
called indexes and may be specified in any of the following forms:
<DL>
<DT> <I>number</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies the page numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first page
in the notebook, 1 to the second, and so on.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>select</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no page is currently
selected, the value -1 is returned.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>end</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifes the last page in the tabnotebook's index. If the notebook is empty
this will return -1.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pattern</I>
</I></B>
<DD> If the index doesn't satisfy any of the above forms, then this form is
used. Pattern is pattern-matched against the label of each page in the
notebook, in order from the first to the last page, until a matching entry
is found. The rules of Tcl_StringMatch are used.
'.............................................................................
The following commands are possible for tabnotebook widgets:
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>add</B> ?<I>option</I> <I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
</I></B>
<DD> Add a new page at the end of the tabnotebook. A new child site frame is
created. Returns the child site pathName. If additional arguments are
present, they specify any of the following options:
</DL>
<UL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-angle</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifes the angle of slope from the inner edge to the outer edge of the
tab. An angle of 0 specifies square tabs. Valid ranges are 0 to 45 degrees
inclusive. Default is 15 degrees. If this option is specified as an empty
string (the default), then the angle option for the overall tabnotebook
is used. This is generally only set at the tabnotebook level. Tabs normally
will want to share the same angle value.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-background</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a background color to use for displaying tabs when they are
selected and for displaying the current page. If this option is specified
as an empty string (the default), then the background option for the
overall tabnotebook is used.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-bevelamount</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifes the size of tab corners. A value of 0 with angle set to 0
results in square tabs. A bevelAmount of 4, means that the tab will be
drawn with angled corners that cut in 4 pixels from the edge of the tab.
The default is 0. This is generally only set at the tabnotebook level.
Tabs normally will want to share the same bevelAmount.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-bitmap</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> If label is a non-empty string, specifies a bitmap to display in this
page's tab. Bitmap may be of any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetPixmap.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-command</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this page is selected. This
allows the programmer a hook to reconfigure this page's widgets or any
other page's widgets.
<UL>
If the tabnotebook has the auto option set to true, when a page is
selected this command will be called immediately after the previously
selected page is unpacked and immediately before this page is selected. The
index value select is valid during this Tcl command. `index select' will
return this page's page number.
</UL>
<UL>
If the auto option is set to false, when a page is selected the unpack
and pack calls are bypassed. This Tcl command is still called.
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-disabledforeground</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when tabs
are in their disable state. If this option is specified as an empty
string (the default), then the disabledforeground option for the overall
tabnotebook is used.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-font</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies the font to use when drawing a text label on a page tab. If
this option is specified as an empty string then the font option for the
overall tabnotebook is used..
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-foreground</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when they are
selected. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default),
then the foreground option for the overall tabnotebook is used.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-label</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a string to display as an identifying label for a notebook
page. This label serves as an additional identifier used to reference the
page. This label may be used for the index value in widget commands.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-tabbackground</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a background color to use for displaying a tab when it is not
elected. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then
the tabBackground option for the overall tabnotebook is used.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-tabforeground</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying the tab's text label
when it is not selected. If this option is specified as an empty
string (the default), then the tabForeground option for the overall

<DL>
<DT> <B>-padx</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space to request
for a tab around its label in the X-direction. When computing how large a
window it needs, the tab will add this amount to the width it would
normally need The tab will end up with extra internal space to the
left and right of its text label. This value may have any of the forms
acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. If this option is specified as an empty
string (the default), then the padX option for the overall tabnotebook is used

<DD> Specifies one of two states for the page: normal or disabled. In normal state
unselected tabs are displayed using the tabforeground and tabbackground
option from the tabnotebook or the page. Selected tabs and pages are
displayed using the foreground and background option from the tabnotebook or
the page. The disabled state means that the page and its tab is
insensitive: it doesn't respond to mouse button presses or releases. In this
state the entry is displayed according to its disabledForeground option for
the tabnotebook and the background/tabbackground option from the page or

The <B>tabnotebook</B> command creates a new window (given by the pathName 
argument) and makes it into a <B>tabnotebook</B> widget. Additional options, 
described above may be specified on the command line or in the option 
database to configure aspects of the tabnotebook such as its colors, font, 
and text. The tabnotebook command returns its pathName argument. At the 
time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named 
d305 8
a312 8
A <B>tabnotebook</B> is a widget that contains a set of tabbed pages. It 
displays one page from the set as the selected page. A Tab displays the 
label for the page to which it is attached and serves as a page 
selector. When a page's tab is selected, the page's contents are displayed 
in the page area. The selected tab has a three-dimensional effect to make 
it appear to float above the other tabs. The tabs are displayed as a group 
along either the left, top, right, or bottom edge. When first created a 
tabnotebook has no pages. Pages may be added or deleted using widget 
d315 5
a319 5
A special option may be provided to the tabnotebook. The <B>-auto</B> 
option specifies whether the tabnotebook will automatically handle the 
unpacking and packing of pages when pages are selected. A value of 
true signifies that the notebook will automatically manage it. This is the 
default value. A value of false signifies the notebook will not perform 
d322 8
a329 8
A tabnotebook's pages area contains a single child site frame. When a 
new page is created it is a child of this frame. The page's child site 
frame serves as a geometry container for applications to pack widgets 
into. It is this frame that is automatically unpacked or packed when 
the auto option is true. This creates the effect of one page being visible 
at a time. When a new page is selected, the previously selected page's 
child site frame is automatically unpacked from the tabnotebook's child 
site frame and the newly selected page's child site is packed into the 
d332 5
a336 5
However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in a different 
manner. By specifying the <B>auto</B> option as <B>false</B>, child site 
packing can be disabled and done differently. For example, all widgets 
might be packed into the first page's child site <B>frame</B>. Then when 
a new page is selected, the application can reconfigure the widgets 
d339 3
a341 3
In both cases the command option for a page specifies a Tcl Command 
to execute when the page is selected. In the case of <B>auto</B> 
being <B>true</B>, it is between the unpacking of the previously selected 
d344 3
a346 3
Notebook pages can also be controlled with scroll bars or other widgets 
that obey the <B>scrollcommand</B> protocol. By giving a scrollbar 
a <B>-command</B> to call the tabnotebook's <B>select</B> method, the 
d351 16
a366 16
Tabs appear along the edge of the notebook area. Tabs are drawn to appear 
attached to their associated page. When a tab is clicked on, the associated 
page is selected and the tab is drawn as raised above all other tabs and as 
a seamless part of its notebook page. Tabs can be controlled in their 
location along the edges, the angle tab sides are drawn with, gap between 
tabs, starting margin of tabs, internal padding around text labels in 
a tab, the font, and its label. 
<P>
The Tab area is implemented with the <B>tabset</B> mega widget. 
See <B>tabset(1)</B>. Tabs may be oriented along either the north, south, 
east, or west sides with the <B>tabPos</B> option. North and south tabs 
may appear as angled, square, or bevelled. West and east tabs may appear 
as square or bevelled. By changing tab gaps, tab angles, bevelling, 
orientations, colors, fonts, start locations, and margins; tabs may appear 
in a wide variety of styles. For example, it is possible to implement 
Microsoft-style tabs, Borland property tab styles, or Borland Delphi 
d370 2
a371 2
The <B>tabnotebook</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose name 
is <I>pathName</I>. This command may be used to invoke various operations 
d379 2
a380 2
Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument an 
indicator of which page of the notebook to operate on. These indicators are 
d385 1
a385 1
<DD> Specifies the page numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first page 
d391 1
a391 1
<DD> Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no page is currently 
d397 1
a397 1
<DD> Specifes the last page in the tabnotebook's index. If the notebook is empty 
d403 3
a405 3
<DD> If the index doesn't satisfy any of the above forms, then this form is 
used. Pattern is pattern-matched against the label of each page in the 
notebook, in order from the first to the last page, until a matching entry 
d413 2
a414 2
<DD> Add a new page at the end of the tabnotebook. A new child site frame is 
created. Returns the child site pathName. If additional arguments are 
d421 5
a425 5
<DD> Specifes the angle of slope from the inner edge to the outer edge of the 
tab. An angle of 0 specifies square tabs. Valid ranges are 0 to 45 degrees 
inclusive. Default is 15 degrees. If this option is specified as an empty 
string (the default), then the angle option for the overall tabnotebook 
is used. This is generally only set at the tabnotebook level. Tabs normally 
d431 3
a433 3
<DD> Specifies a background color to use for displaying tabs when they are 
selected and for displaying the current page. If this option is specified 
as an empty string (the default), then the background option for the 
d439 4
a442 4
<DD> Specifes the size of tab corners. A value of 0 with angle set to 0 
results in square tabs. A bevelAmount of 4, means that the tab will be 
drawn with angled corners that cut in 4 pixels from the edge of the tab. 
The default is 0. This is generally only set at the tabnotebook level. 
d448 2
a449 2
<DD> If label is a non-empty string, specifies a bitmap to display in this 
page's tab. Bitmap may be of any of the forms accepted by Tk_GetPixmap. 
d454 2
a455 2
<DD> Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this page is selected. This 
allows the programmer a hook to reconfigure this page's widgets or any 
d458 5
a462 5
If the tabnotebook has the auto option set to true, when a page is 
selected this command will be called immediately after the previously 
selected page is unpacked and immediately before this page is selected. The 
index value select is valid during this Tcl command. `index select' will 
return this page's page number.
