Turns on/off the 3rd mouse button capability. The value may be specified
in any of the forms acceptable to \fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR.  This feature
allows the right mouse button to cycle through the popup

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBiwidgets::optionmenu\fR command creates an option menu widget with options
to manage it.  An option menu displays a frame containing a label and a button.
A pop-up menu will allow for the value of the button to change.

.SH "METHODS"
.PP
The \fBiwidgets::optionmenu\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.DS
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.DE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.
.PP
Many of the widget commands for an optionmenu take as one argument an
indicator of which entry of the option menu to operate on.  These
indicators are called \fIindex\fRes and may be specified in
any of the following forms:
.TP 12
\fInumber\fR
Specifies the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds
to the top-most entry of the option menu, 1 to the entry below it, and
so on.
.TP 12
\fBend\fR
Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu.  If there are no
entries in the menu then -1 is returned.
.TP 12
\fBselect\fR
Returns the numerical index of the currently selected option menu entry.
If no entries exist in the menu, then -1 is returned.
.TP 12
\fIpattern\fR
If the index doesn't satisfy one of the above forms then this
form is used.  \fIPattern\fR is pattern-matched against the label of
each entry in the option menu, in order from the top down, until a
matching entry is found.  The rules of \fBTcl_StringMatch\fR
are used.
.PP
The following widget commands are possible for optionmenu widgets:

.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS"
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcget\fR \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option given
by \fIoption\fR.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBiwidgets::optionmenu\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName\fR \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  If \fIoption\fR is specified
with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If
one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBiwidgets::optionmenu\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBdelete \fIfirst\fR ?\fIlast\fR?
Delete all of the option menu entries between \fIfirst\fR and
\fIlast\fR inclusive.  If \fIlast\fR is omitted then it defaults
to \fIfirst\fR.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBdisable \fIindex\fR
Disable the option menu entry specified by \fIindex\fR.
Disabling a menu item will prevent the user from being able to select
this item from the menu.  This only effects the state of the item
in the menu, in other words, should the item be the currently
selected item, the programmer is responsible for determining this condition
and taking appropriate action.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBenable \fIindex\fR
Enable the option menu entry specified by \fIindex\fR.
Enabling a menu item allows the user to select this item from the menu.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBget\fR ?\fIfirst\fR? ?\fIlast\fR?
If no arguments are specified, this operation returns the currently
selected option menu item.  Otherwise, it returns the name of the
option at index \fIfirst\fR, or a range of options between \fIfirst\fR
and \fIlast\fR.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBindex \fIindex\fR
Returns the numerical index corresponding to \fIindex\fR.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinsert \fIindex string\fR ?\fIstring\fR?
Insert an item, or list of items, into the menu at location \fIindex\fR.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBselect \fIindex\fR
Select an item from the option menu to be displayed as the currently
selected item.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBsort \fImode\fR
Sort the current menu in either \fBascending\fR, or \fBdescending\fR order.
The values \fBincreasing\fR, or \fBdecreasing\fR are also accepted.
