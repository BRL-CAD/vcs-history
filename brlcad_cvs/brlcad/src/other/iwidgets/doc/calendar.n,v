.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBiwidgets::calendar\fR command creates a calendar widget for the selection
of a date, displaying a single month at a time.  Buttons exist on the
top to change the month in effect turning the pages of a calendar.  As
a page is turned, the dates for the month are modified.  Selection of
a date visually marks that date.  The selected value can be monitored
via the -command option or just retrieved using the get command.

.SH "METHODS"
.PP
The \fBiwidgets::calendar\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.DS C
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.DE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are possible for calendar widgets:

.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS"
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcget\fR \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option given
by \fIoption\fR.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBiwidgets::calendar\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName\fR \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  If \fIoption\fR is specified
with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If
one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBiwidgets::calendar\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBget\fR ?\fBformat\fR?
Returns the currently selected date in a format of
string or as an integer clock value using the \fB-string\fR and \fB-clicks\fR
format options respectively.  The default is by string.  Reference the
clock command for more information on obtaining dates and their
formats.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBselect\fR \fIdate\fR
Changes the currently selected date to the value specified which
must be in the form of a date string, an integer clock value or as
the keyword "now".  Reference the clock
command for more information on obtaining dates and their formats.
Note that selecting a date does not change the
month being shown to that of the date given.  This chore is left
to the \fBshow\fR command.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBshow\fR \fIdate\fR
Changes the currently displayed date to be that of the date
argument which must be in the form of a date string, an
integer clock value or as
the keyword "now".  Reference the clock
command for more information on obtaining dates and their formats.

.SH "COMPONENTS"
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBforward\fR
Class:	\fBButton\fR
.fi

calendar that changes the month to be the next.  See the "button"
widget manual entry for details on the forward component item.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBpage\fR
Class:	\fBCanvas\fR
.fi
.IP
The page component provides the canvas on which the title, days of the
week, and days of the month appear.  See the "canvas" widget manual
entry for details on the page component item.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBbackward\fR
Class:	\fBButton\fR
.fi
.TP
The backward component provides the button on the upper right of the
calendar that changes the month to be the next.  See the "button"
widget manual entry for details on the backward component item.
