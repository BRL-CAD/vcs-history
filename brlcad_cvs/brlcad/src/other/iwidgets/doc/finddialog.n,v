.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBiwidgets::finddialog\fR command creates a find dialog that works in
conjunction with a text or scrolledtext widget to provide a means
of performing search operations.  The user is prompted for a text
pattern to be found in the text or scrolledtext widget.  The
search can be for all occurances, by regular expression, considerate
of the case, or backwards.

.SH "METHODS"
.PP
The \fBiwidgets::finddialog\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.DS C
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.DE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are possible for finddialog widgets:

.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS"
.TP
\fIpathName \fBcget\fR \fIoption\fR
Returns the current value of the configuration option given
by \fIoption\fR.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBiwidgets::finddialog\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBclear\fR
Clears the pattern in the entry field and the pattern matchin
indicators in the text or scrolledtext widget.
.TP
\fIpathName\fR \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  If \fIoption\fR is specified
with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If
one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBiwidgets::finddialog\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBfind\fR
Search for a specific text string in the text widget given by
the -textwidget option.  This method is the standard callback
for the Find button.  It is made available such that it can be
bound to a find again action.
