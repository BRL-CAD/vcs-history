@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

; This file defines the virtual base addresses for the Dynamic Link Libraries
; that are part of the Tcl system.  The first token on a line is the key (or name
; of the DLL) and the second token is the virtual base address, in hexidecimal.
; The third token is the maximum size of the DLL image file, including symbols.
;
; Using a specified "prefered load address" should speed loading time by avoiding
; relocations (NT supported only).  It is assumed extension authors will contribute
; their modules to this grand-master list.  You can use the dumpbin utility with
; the /headers option to get the "size of image" data (already in hex).  If the
; maximum size is too small a linker warning will occur.  Modules can overlap when
; they're mutually exclusive.  This info is placed in the DLL's PE header by the
; linker with the `-base:@@$(TCLDIR)\win\coffbase.txt,<key>` option.
