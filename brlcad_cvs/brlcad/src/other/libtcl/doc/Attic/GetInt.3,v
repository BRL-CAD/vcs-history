@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures convert from strings to integers or double-precision
floating-point values or booleans (represented as 0- or 1-valued
integers).  Each of the procedures takes a \fIstring\fR argument,
converts it to an internal form of a particular type, and stores
the converted value at the location indicated by the procedure's
third argument.  If all goes well, each of the procedures returns
TCL_OK.  If \fIstring\fR doesn't have the proper syntax for the
desired type then TCL_ERROR is returned, an error message is left
in the interpreter's result, and nothing is stored at *\fIintPtr\fR
or *\fIdoublePtr\fR or *\fIboolPtr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetInt\fR expects \fIstring\fR to consist of a collection
of integer digits, optionally signed and optionally preceded by
white space.  If the first two characters of \fIstring\fR are ``0x''
then \fIstring\fR is expected to be in hexadecimal form;  otherwise,
if the first character of \fIstring\fR is ``0'' then \fIstring\fR
is expected to be in octal form;  otherwise, \fIstring\fR is
expected to be in decimal form.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetDouble\fR expects \fIstring\fR to consist of a floating-point
number, which is:  white space;  a sign; a sequence of digits;  a
decimal point;  a sequence of digits;  the letter ``e'';  and a
signed decimal exponent.  Any of the fields may be omitted, except that
the digits either before or after the decimal point must be present
and if the ``e'' is present then it must be followed by the
exponent number.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR expects \fIstring\fR to specify a boolean
value.  If \fIstring\fR is any of \fB0\fR, \fBfalse\fR,
\fBno\fR, or \fBoff\fR, then \fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR stores a zero
value at \fI*boolPtr\fR.
If \fIstring\fR is any of \fB1\fR, \fBtrue\fR, \fByes\fR, or \fBon\fR,
then 1 is stored at \fI*boolPtr\fR.
Any of these values may be abbreviated, and upper-case spellings
are also acceptable.
