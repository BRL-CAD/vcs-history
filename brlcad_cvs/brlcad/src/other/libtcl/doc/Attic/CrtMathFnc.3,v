@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tcl allows a number of mathematical functions to be used in
expressions, such as \fBsin\fR, \fBcos\fR, and \fBhypot\fR.
\fBTcl_CreateMathFunc\fR allows applications to add additional functions
to those already provided by Tcl or to replace existing functions.
\fIName\fR is the name of the function as it will appear in expressions.
If \fIname\fR doesn't already exist as a function then a new function
is created.  If it does exist, then the existing function is replaced.
\fINumArgs\fR and \fIargTypes\fR describe the arguments to the function.
Each entry in the \fIargTypes\fR array must be
.VS 8.4
one of TCL_INT, TCL_DOUBLE, TCL_WIDE_INT,
or TCL_EITHER to indicate whether the corresponding argument must be an
integer, a double-precision floating value, a wide (64-bit) integer,
or any, respectively.
.VE 8.4
.PP
Whenever the function is invoked in an expression Tcl will invoke
\fIproc\fR.  \fIProc\fR should have arguments and result that match
the type \fBTcl_MathProc\fR:
.CS
typedef int Tcl_MathProc(
	ClientData \fIclientData\fR,
	Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR,
	Tcl_Value *\fIargs\fR,
	Tcl_Value *\fIresultPtr\fR);
.CE
.PP
When \fIproc\fR is invoked the \fIclientData\fR and \fIinterp\fR
arguments will be the same as those passed to \fBTcl_CreateMathFunc\fR.
\fIArgs\fR will point to an array of \fInumArgs\fR Tcl_Value structures,
which describe the actual arguments to the function:
.VS 8.4
.CS
typedef struct Tcl_Value {
	Tcl_ValueType \fItype\fR;
	long \fIintValue\fR;
	double \fIdoubleValue\fR;
	Tcl_WideInt \fIwideValue\fR;
} Tcl_Value;
.CE
.PP
The \fItype\fR field indicates the type of the argument and is
one of TCL_INT, TCL_DOUBLE or TCL_WIDE_INT.
.VE 8.4
It will match the \fIargTypes\fR value specified for the function unless
the \fIargTypes\fR value was TCL_EITHER. Tcl converts
the argument supplied in the expression to the type requested in
\fIargTypes\fR, if that is necessary.
Depending on the value of the \fItype\fR field, the \fIintValue\fR,
.VS 8.4
\fIdoubleValue\fR or \fIwideValue\fR
.VE 8.4
field will contain the actual value of the argument.
.PP
\fIProc\fR should compute its result and store it either as an integer
in \fIresultPtr->intValue\fR or as a floating value in
\fIresultPtr->doubleValue\fR.
It should set also \fIresultPtr->type\fR to one of
.VS 8.4
TCL_INT, TCL_DOUBLE or TCL_WIDE_INT
.VE 8.4
to indicate which value was set.
Under normal circumstances \fIproc\fR should return TCL_OK.
If an error occurs while executing the function, \fIproc\fR should
return TCL_ERROR and leave an error message in the interpreter's result.
.PP
.VS 8.4
\fBTcl_GetMathFuncInfo\fR retrieves the values associated with
function \fIname\fR that were passed to a preceding
\fBTcl_CreateMathFunc\fR call.  Normally, the return code is
\fBTCL_OK\fR but if the named function does not exist, \fBTCL_ERROR\fR
is returned and an error message is placed in the interpreter's
result.
.PP
If an error did not occur, the array reference placed in the variable
pointed to by \fIargTypesPtr\fR is newly allocated, and should be
released by passing it to \fBTcl_Free\fR.  Some functions (the
standard set implemented in the core) are implemented directly at the
bytecode level; attempting to retrieve values for them causes a NULL
to be stored in the variable pointed to by \fIprocPtr\fR and the
variable pointed to by \fIclientDataPtr\fR will not be modified.
.PP
\fBTcl_ListMathFuncs\fR returns a Tcl object containing a list of all
the math functions defined in the interpreter whose name matches
\fIpattern\fR.  In the case of an error, NULL is returned and an error
message is left in the interpreter result, and otherwise the returned
object will have a reference count of zero.
