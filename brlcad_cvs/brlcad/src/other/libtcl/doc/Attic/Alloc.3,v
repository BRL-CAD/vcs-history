@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures provide a platform and compiler independent interface
for memory allocation.  Programs that need to transfer ownership of
memory blocks between Tcl and other modules should use these routines
rather than the native \fBmalloc()\fR and \fBfree()\fR routines
provided by the C run-time library.
.PP
\fBTcl_Alloc\fR returns a pointer to a block of at least \fIsize\fR
bytes suitably aligned for any use.
.PP
\fBTcl_Free\fR makes the space referred to by \fIptr\fR available for
further allocation.
.PP
\fBTcl_Realloc\fR changes the size of the block pointed to by
\fIptr\fR to \fIsize\fR bytes and returns a pointer to the new block.
The contents will be unchanged up to the lesser of the new and old
sizes.  The returned location may be different from \fIptr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_AttemptAlloc\fR and \fBTcl_AttemptRealloc\fR are identical in
function to \fBTcl_Alloc\fR and \fBTcl_Realloc\fR, except that
\fBTcl_AttemptAlloc\fR and \fBTcl_AttemptRealloc\fR will not cause the Tcl
interpreter to \fBpanic\fR if the memory allocation fails.  If the
allocation fails, these functions will return NULL.  Note that on some
platforms, attempting to allocate a block of memory will also cause
these functions to return NULL.
.PP
The procedures \fBckalloc\fR, \fBckfree\fR, \fBckrealloc\fR,
\fBattemptckalloc\fR, and \fBattemptckrealloc\fR are implemented
as macros.  Normally, they are synonyms for the corresponding
procedures documented on this page.  When Tcl and all modules
calling Tcl are compiled with \fBTCL_MEM_DEBUG\fR defined, however,
these macros are redefined to be special debugging versions of 
of these procedures.  To support Tcl's memory debugging within a
module, use the macros rather than direct calls to \fBTcl_Alloc\fR, etc.
