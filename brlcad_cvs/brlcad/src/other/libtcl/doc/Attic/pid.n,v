@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
pid \- Retrieve process id(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpid \fR?\fIfileId\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
If the \fIfileId\fR argument is given then it should normally
refer to a process pipeline created with the \fBopen\fR command.
In this case the \fBpid\fR command will return a list whose elements
are the process identifiers of all the processes in the pipeline,
in order.
The list will be empty if \fIfileId\fR refers to an open file
that isn't a process pipeline.
If no \fIfileId\fR argument is given then \fBpid\fR returns the process
identifier of the current process.
All process identifiers are returned as decimal strings.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
exec(n), open(n)

.SH KEYWORDS
file, pipeline, process identifier
