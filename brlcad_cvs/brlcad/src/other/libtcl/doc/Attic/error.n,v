@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
error \- Generate an error
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBerror \fImessage\fR ?\fIinfo\fR? ?\fIcode\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns a TCL_ERROR code, which causes command interpretation to be
unwound.  \fIMessage\fR is a string that is returned to the application
to indicate what went wrong.
.PP
If the \fIinfo\fR argument is provided and is non-empty,
it is used to initialize the global variable \fBerrorInfo\fR.
\fBerrorInfo\fR is used to accumulate a stack trace of what
was in progress when an error occurred; as nested commands unwind,
the Tcl interpreter adds information to \fBerrorInfo\fR.  If the
\fIinfo\fR argument is present, it is used to initialize
\fBerrorInfo\fR and the first increment of unwind information
will not be added by the Tcl interpreter.  In other
words, the command containing the \fBerror\fR command will not appear
in \fBerrorInfo\fR; in its place will be \fIinfo\fR.
This feature is most useful in conjunction with the \fBcatch\fR command:
if a caught error cannot be handled successfully, \fIinfo\fR can be used
to return a stack trace reflecting the original point of occurrence
of the error:
.CS
\fBcatch {...} errMsg
set savedInfo $errorInfo
\&...
error $errMsg $savedInfo\fR
.CE
.PP
If the \fIcode\fR argument is present, then its value is stored
in the \fBerrorCode\fR global variable.  This variable is intended
to hold a machine-readable description of the error in cases where
such information is available; see the \fBtclvars\fR manual
page for information on the proper format for the variable.
If the \fIcode\fR argument is not
present, then \fBerrorCode\fR is automatically reset to
``NONE'' by the Tcl interpreter as part of processing the
error generated by the command.
