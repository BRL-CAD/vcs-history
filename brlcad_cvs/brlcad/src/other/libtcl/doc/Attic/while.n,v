@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
while \- Execute script repeatedly as long as a condition is met
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwhile \fItest body\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBwhile\fR command evaluates \fItest\fR as an expression
(in the same way that \fBexpr\fR evaluates its argument).
The value of the expression must a proper boolean
value; if it is a true value
then \fIbody\fR is executed by passing it to the Tcl interpreter.
Once \fIbody\fR has been executed then \fItest\fR is evaluated
again, and the process repeats until eventually \fItest\fR
evaluates to a false boolean value.  \fBContinue\fR
commands may be executed inside \fIbody\fR to terminate the current
iteration of the loop, and \fBbreak\fR
commands may be executed inside \fIbody\fR to cause immediate
termination of the \fBwhile\fR command.  The \fBwhile\fR command
always returns an empty string.
.PP
Note: \fItest\fR should almost always be enclosed in braces.  If not,
variable substitutions will be made before the \fBwhile\fR
command starts executing, which means that variable changes
made by the loop body will not be considered in the expression.
This is likely to result in an infinite loop.  If \fItest\fR is
enclosed in braces, variable substitutions are delayed until the
expression is evaluated (before
each loop iteration), so changes in the variables will be visible.
For an example, try the following script with and without the braces
around \fB$x<10\fR:
.CS
set x 0
while {$x<10} {
	puts "x is $x"
	incr x
}
.CE
