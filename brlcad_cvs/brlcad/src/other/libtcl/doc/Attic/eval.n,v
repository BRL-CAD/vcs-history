@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
eval \- Evaluate a Tcl script
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBeval \fIarg \fR?\fIarg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBEval\fR takes one or more arguments, which together comprise a Tcl
script containing one or more commands.
\fBEval\fR concatenates all its arguments in the same
fashion as the \fBconcat\fR command, passes the concatenated string to the
Tcl interpreter recursively, and returns the result of that
evaluation (or any error generated by it).
Note that the \fBlist\fR command quotes sequences of words in such a
way that they are not further expanded by the \fBeval\fR command.

.SH KEYWORDS
concatenate, evaluate, script

.SH "SEE ALSO"
catch(n), concat(n), error(n), list(n), subst(n), tclvars(n)
