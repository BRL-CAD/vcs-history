@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
fblocked \- Test whether the last input operation exhausted all available input
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfblocked \fIchannelId\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBfblocked\fR command returns 1 if the most recent input operation
on \fIchannelId\fR returned less information than requested because all
available input was exhausted.
For example, if \fBgets\fR is invoked when there are only three
characters available for input and no end-of-line sequence, \fBgets\fR
returns an empty string and a subsequent call to \fBfblocked\fR will
return 1.
.PP
.VS
\fIChannelId\fR must be an identifier for an open channel such as a
Tcl standard channel (\fBstdin\fR, \fBstdout\fR, or \fBstderr\fR),
the return value from an invocation of \fBopen\fR or \fBsocket\fR, or
the result of a channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension.
