@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
encoding \- Manipulate encodings
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBencoding \fIoption\fR ?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH INTRODUCTION
.PP
Strings in Tcl are encoded using 16-bit Unicode characters.  Different
operating system interfaces or applications may generate strings in
other encodings such as Shift-JIS.  The \fBencoding\fR command helps
to bridge the gap between Unicode and these other formats.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Performs one of several encoding related operations, depending on
\fIoption\fR.  The legal \fIoption\fRs are:
.TP
\fBencoding convertfrom ?\fIencoding\fR? \fIdata\fR
Convert \fIdata\fR to Unicode from the specified \fIencoding\fR.  The
characters in \fIdata\fR are treated as binary data where the lower
8-bits of each character is taken as a single byte.  The resulting
sequence of bytes is treated as a string in the specified
\fIencoding\fR.  If \fIencoding\fR is not specified, the current
system encoding is used.
.TP
\fBencoding convertto ?\fIencoding\fR? \fIstring\fR
Convert \fIstring\fR from Unicode to the specified \fIencoding\fR.
The result is a sequence of bytes that represents the converted
string.  Each byte is stored in the lower 8-bits of a Unicode
character.  If \fIencoding\fR is not specified, the current
system encoding is used.
.TP
\fBencoding names\fR
Returns a list containing the names of all of the encodings that are
currently available. 
.TP
\fBencoding system\fR ?\fIencoding\fR?
Set the system encoding to \fIencoding\fR. If \fIencoding\fR is
omitted then the command returns the current system encoding.  The
system encoding is used whenever Tcl passes strings to system calls.

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
It is common practice to write script files using a text editor that
produces output in the euc-jp encoding, which represents the ASCII
characters as singe bytes and Japanese characters as two bytes.  This
makes it easy to embed literal strings that correspond to non-ASCII
characters by simply typing the strings in place in the script.
However, because the \fBsource\fR command always reads files using the
current system encoding, Tcl will only source such files correctly
when the encoding used to write the file is the same.  This tends not
to be true in an internationalized setting.  For example, if such a
file was sourced in North America (where the ISO8859-1 is normally
used), each byte in the file would be treated as a separate character
that maps to the 00 page in Unicode.  The resulting Tcl strings will
not contain the expected Japanese characters.  Instead, they will
contain a sequence of Latin-1 characters that correspond to the bytes
of the original string.  The \fBencoding\fR command can be used to
convert this string to the expected Japanese Unicode characters.  For
example,
.CS
	set s [encoding convertfrom euc-jp "\\xA4\\xCF"]
.CE
would return the Unicode string "\\u306F", which is the Hiragana
letter HA.
