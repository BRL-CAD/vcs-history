@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
Tcl_Sleep \- delay execution for a given number of milliseconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTcl_Sleep\fR(\fIms\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AP int ms in
Number of milliseconds to sleep.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure delays the calling process by the number of
milliseconds given by the \fIms\fR parameter and returns
after that time has elapsed.  It is typically used for things
like flashing a button, where the delay is short and the
application needn't do anything while it waits.  For longer
delays where the application needs to respond to other events
during the delay, the procedure \fBTcl_CreateTimerHandler\fR
should be used instead of \fBTcl_Sleep\fR.

.SH KEYWORDS
sleep, time, wait
