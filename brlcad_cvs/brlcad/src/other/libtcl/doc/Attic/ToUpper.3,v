@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The first three routines convert the case of individual Unicode characters:
.PP
If \fIch\fR represents a lower-case character,
\fBTcl_UniCharToUpper\fR returns the corresponding upper-case
character.  If no upper-case character is defined, it returns the
character unchanged.
.PP
If \fIch\fR represents an upper-case character,
\fBTcl_UniCharToLower\fR returns the corresponding lower-case
character.  If no lower-case character is defined, it returns the
character unchanged.
.PP
If \fIch\fR represents a lower-case character,
\fBTcl_UniCharToTitle\fR returns the corresponding title-case
character.  If no title-case character is defined, it returns the
corresponding upper-case character.  If no upper-case character is
defined, it returns the character unchanged.  Title-case is defined
for a small number of characters that have a different appearance when
they are at the beginning of a capitalized word.
.PP
The next three routines convert the case of UTF-8 strings in place in
memory:
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR changes every UTF-8 character in \fIstr\fR to
upper-case.  Because changing the case of a character may change its
size, the byte offset of each character in the resulting string may
differ from its original location.  \fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR writes a null
byte at the end of the converted string.  \fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR returns
the new length of the string in bytes.  This new length is guaranteed
to be no longer than the original string length.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfToLower\fR is the same as \fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR except it
turns each character in the string into its lower-case equivalent.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfToTitle\fR is the same as \fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR except it
turns the first character in the string into its title-case equivalent
and all following characters into their lower-case equivalents.

.SH BUGS
.PP
At this time, the case conversions are only defined for the ISO8859-1
characters.  Unicode characters above 0x00ff are not modified by these
routines.

.SH KEYWORDS
