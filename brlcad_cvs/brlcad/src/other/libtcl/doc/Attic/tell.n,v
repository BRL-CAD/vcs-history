@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
tell \- Return current access position for an open channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtell \fIchannelId\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.VS 8.1
Returns an integer string giving the current access position in
\fIchannelId\fR.  This value returned is a byte offset that can be passed to
\fBseek\fR in order to set the channel to a particular position.  Note
that this value is in terms of bytes, not characters like \fBread\fR.
.VE 8.1
The value returned is -1 for channels that do not support
seeking.
.PP
.VS
\fIChannelId\fR must be an identifier for an open channel such as a
Tcl standard channel (\fBstdin\fR, \fBstdout\fR, or \fBstderr\fR),
the return value from an invocation of \fBopen\fR or \fBsocket\fR, or
the result of a channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension.
.VE
