@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
pkg::create \- Construct an appropriate \fBpackage ifneeded\fR
command for a given package specification
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB::pkg::create \fI\-name packageName\fR \fI\-version packageVersion\fR ?\fI\-load filespec\fR? ... ?\fI\-source filespec\fR? ...
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB::pkg::create\fR is a utility procedure that is part of the standard Tcl
library.  It is used to create an appropriate \fBpackage ifneeded\fR
command for a given package specification.  It can be used to construct a
\fBpkgIndex.tcl\fR file for use with the \fBpackage\fR mechanism.

.SH OPTIONS
The parameters supported are:
.TP
\fB\-name\fR\0\fIpackageName\fR
This parameter specifies the name of the package.  It is required.
.TP
\fB\-version\fR\0\fIpackageVersion\fR
This parameter specifies the version of the package.  It is required.
.TP
\fB\-load\fR\0\fIfilespec\fR
This parameter specifies a binary library that must be loaded with the
\fBload\fR command.  \fIfilespec\fR is a list with two elements.  The
first element is the name of the file to load.  The second, optional
element is a list of commands supplied by loading that file.  If the
list of procedures is empty or omitted, \fB::pkg::create\fR will
set up the library for direct loading (see \fBpkg_mkIndex\fR).  Any
number of \fB\-load\fR parameters may be specified.
.TP
\fB\-source\fR\0\fIfilespec\fR
This parameter is similar to the \fB\-load\fR parameter, except that it
specifies a Tcl library that must be loaded with the
\fBsource\fR command.  Any number of \fB\-source\fR parameters may be
specified.
.PP
At least one \fB\-load\fR or \fB\-source\fR parameter must be given.
