@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.TH Tcl_StringMatch 3 8.1 Tcl "Tcl Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Tcl_StringMatch, Tcl_StringCaseMatch \- test whether a string matches a pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_StringMatch\fR(\fIstring\fR, \fIpattern\fR)
.sp
int
\fBTcl_StringCaseMatch\fR(\fIstring\fR, \fIpattern\fR, \fInocase\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AP char *string in
String to test.
.AP char *pattern in
Pattern to match against string.  May contain special
characters from the set *?\e[].
.AP int nocase in
Specifies whether the match should be done case-sensitive (0) or
case-insensitive (1).
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This utility procedure determines whether a string matches
a given pattern.  If it does, then \fBTcl_StringMatch\fR returns
1.  Otherwise \fBTcl_StringMatch\fR returns 0.  The algorithm
used for matching is the same algorithm used in the ``string match''
Tcl command and is similar to the algorithm used by the C-shell
for file name matching;  see the Tcl manual entry for details.
.VS 8.1
.PP
In \fBTcl_StringCaseMatch\fR, the algorithm is the same, but you have
the option to make the matching case-insensitive.  If you choose this
(by passing \fBnocase\fR as 1), then the string and pattern are
essentially matched in the lower case.
.VE 8.1

.SH KEYWORDS
match, pattern, string

@dawn of a new revision.  it shall be numbered 14 to match release 7.  begin the convergence by adding emacs/vi local variable footer blocks to encourage consistent formatting.
