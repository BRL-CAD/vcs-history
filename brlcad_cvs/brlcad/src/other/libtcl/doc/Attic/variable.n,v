@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
variable \- create and initialize a namespace variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvariable \fR?\fIname value...\fR? \fIname \fR?\fIvalue\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command is normally used within a
\fBnamespace eval\fR command to create one or more variables
within a namespace.
Each variable \fIname\fR is initialized with \fIvalue\fR.
The \fIvalue\fR for the last variable is optional.
.PP
If a variable \fIname\fR does not exist, it is created.
In this case, if \fIvalue\fR is specified,
it is assigned to the newly created variable.
If no \fIvalue\fR is specified, the new variable is left undefined.
If the variable already exists,
it is set to \fIvalue\fR if \fIvalue\fR is specified
or left unchanged if no \fIvalue\fR is given.
Normally, \fIname\fR is unqualified
(does not include the names of any containing namespaces),
and the variable is created in the current namespace.
If \fIname\fR includes any namespace qualifiers,
the variable is created in the specified namespace.  If the variable
is not defined, it will be visible to the \fBnamespace which\fR
command, but not to the \fBinfo exists\fR command.
.PP
If the \fBvariable\fR command is executed inside a Tcl procedure,
it creates local variables
linked to the corresponding namespace variables (and therefore these
variables are listed by \fBinfo locals\fR.)
In this way the \fBvariable\fR command resembles the \fBglobal\fR command,
although the \fBglobal\fR command
only links to variables in the global namespace.
If any \fIvalue\fRs are given,
they are used to modify the values of the associated namespace variables.
If a namespace variable does not exist,
it is created and optionally initialized.
.PP
A \fIname\fR argument cannot reference an element within an array.
Instead, \fIname\fR should reference the entire array,
and the initialization \fIvalue\fR should be left off.
After the variable has been declared,
elements within the array can be set using ordinary
\fBset\fR or \fBarray\fR commands.
