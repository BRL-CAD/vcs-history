@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
Tcl_GetCwd, Tcl_Chdir \- manipulate the current working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
char *
\fBTcl_GetCwd\fR(\fIinterp\fR, \fIbufferPtr\fR)
.sp
int
\fBTcl_Chdir\fR(\fIpath\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_DString *bufferPtr
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter in which to report an error, if any.
.AP Tcl_DString *bufferPtr in/out
This dynamic string is used to store the current working directory.
At the time of the call it should be uninitialized or free.  The
caller must eventually call \fBTcl_DStringFree\fR to free up
anything stored here.
.AP char *path in
File path in UTF\-8 format.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures may be used to manipulate the current working
directory for the application.  They provide C\-level access to
the same functionality as the Tcl \fBpwd\fR command.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetCwd\fR returns a pointer to a string specifying the current
directory, or NULL if the current directory could not be determined.
If NULL is returned, an error message is left in the interp's result.
Storage for the result string is allocated in bufferPtr; the caller
must call \fBTcl_DStringFree()\fR when the result is no longer needed.
The format of the path is UTF\-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Chdir\fR changes the applications current working directory to
the value specified in \fIpath\fR.  The format of the passed in string
must be UTF\-8.  The function returns -1 on error or 0 on success.
