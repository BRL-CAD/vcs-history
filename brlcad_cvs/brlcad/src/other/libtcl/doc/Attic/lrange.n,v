@upgrade tcl/tk from 8.4.6 to 8.5a5; also move to a recursive configure, using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS to call upon tcl, tk, and enigma's configure scripts as needed instead of redoing their build systems for our purpose.  this has a rather drastic impact on the way the libraries are linked together, including the need to compile tcl/tk static so as to avoid libtool portability issues as well as letting us take advantage of their build system for reduced maintenance and easing future upgrades.  undoubtedly more build issues to be worked out with other platforms given the extent of this change.  this does move us one step closer towards correctly linking against system tcl/tk installations too.

.SH NAME
lrange \- Return one or more adjacent elements from a list
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlrange \fIlist first last\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIList\fR must be a valid Tcl list.  This command will
return a new list consisting of elements
\fIfirst\fR through \fIlast\fR, inclusive.
\fIFirst\fR or \fIlast\fR
may be \fBend\fR (or any abbreviation of it) to refer to the last
element of the list.
If \fIfirst\fR is less than zero, it is treated as if it were zero.
If \fIlast\fR is greater than or equal to the number of elements
in the list, then it is treated as if it were \fBend\fR.
If \fIfirst\fR is greater than \fIlast\fR then an empty string
is returned.
Note: ``\fBlrange \fIlist first first\fR'' does not always produce the
same result as ``\fBlindex \fIlist first\fR'' (although it often does
for simple fields that aren't enclosed in braces); it does, however,
produce exactly the same results as ``\fBlist [lindex \fIlist first\fB]\fR''
