.SH NAME
Blt_TreeGetNode \- Finds the node from the ID.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <bltTree.h>\fR
.sp
Blt_TreeNode
\fBBlt_TreeGetNode\fR(\fItree\fR, \fInumber\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "unsigned int" number
.AP Blt_Tree tree in
Tree containing the requested node.
.AP "unsigned int" number in
Serial number of the requested node.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
This procedure returns a node in a tree object
based upon a give serial number.
The node is searched using the serial number.

The arguments are as follows:
.TP 1i
\fItree\fR
The tree containing the requested node.
.TP 1i
\fInumber\fR
The serial number of the requested node.
.SH RETURNS
The node represented by the given serial number is returned.  If no
node with that ID exists in \fItree\fR then NULL is returned.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example gets the node from a serial number.
.CS
unsigned int number;
Blt_TreeNode node;
Blt_TreeToken token;
...
node = Blt_TreeGetNode(token, number);
if (node == NULL) {
    printf("no node with ID %d exists\\n", number);
} else {
    printf("node found: label is %s\\n", Blt_TreeNodeLabel(node));
