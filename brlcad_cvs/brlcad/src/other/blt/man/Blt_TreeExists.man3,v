.SH NAME
Blt_TreeExists \- Indicates if a tree exists.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <bltTree.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBBlt_TreeExists\fR(\fIinterp\fR, \fIname\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter to determine current namespace context.
.AP "const char" *name  in
Name of an existing tree data object.  Can be qualified by a namespace.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure determines if a C-based tree data object exists by
a given name. The arguments are as follows:
.TP 1i
interp
Used the determine the current namespace context.
.TP 1i
name
Name of an existing tree data object.  \fIName\fR can be qualified by
a namespace such as \f(CWfred::myTree\fR.  If no namespace qualifier
is used, the current namespace is searched, then the global namespace.
.PP
.SH RETURNS
A boolean result is returned.  If the tree exists 1 is returned,
0 otherwise.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example checks if a tree "myTree" exists.
.CS
.ft CW
if (!Blt_TreeExists(interp, "myTree")) {
    fprintf(stderr, "can't find tree \\"myTree\\\\n");
