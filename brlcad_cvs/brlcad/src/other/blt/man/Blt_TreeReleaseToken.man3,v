initialized either by \fBTcl_TreeGetToken\fI or \fIBlt_TreeCreate\fR
earlier.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following example creates and then releases a new token.
.CS
Blt_Tree token;

if (Blt_TreeCreate(interp, "myTree", &token) != TCL_OK) {
    return TCL_ERROR;
}
printf("tree is %s\\n", Blt_TreeName(token));

/* Tree will be destroyed when the token is released. */
