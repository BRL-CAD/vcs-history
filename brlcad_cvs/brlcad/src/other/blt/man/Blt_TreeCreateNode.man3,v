.TH Blt_TreeCreateNode 3 BLT_VERSION BLT "BLT Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Blt_TreeCreateNode \- Creates a node in a tree data object.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <bltTree.h>
.sp
Blt_TreeNode
\fBBlt_TreeCreateNode\fR(\fItree\fR, \fIparent\fR, \fIname\fR, \fIposition\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Blt_TreeNode parent
.AP Blt_Tree tree in
Tree containing the parent node.
.AP Blt_TreeNode parent in
Node in which to insert the new child.
.AP "const char" *name  in
Node label.  If NULL, a label will automatically be generated.
.AP int position in
Position in the parent's list of children to insert the new node.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure creates a new node is a tree data object.  The node
is initially empty, but data values can be added with
\fBBlt_TreeSetValue\fR.  Each node has a serial number that identifies it
within the tree.  No two nodes in the same tree will ever have the
same ID.  You can find a node's ID with \fBBlt_TreeNodeId\fR.
.PP
The arguments are as follows:
.TP 1i
\fItree\fR
The tree containing the parent node.
.TP
\fIparent\fR
Node in which the new child will be inserted.
.TP
\fIname\fR
Label of the new node.  If \fIname\fR is NULL, a label in the
form "\f(CWnode0\fR", "\f(CWnode1\fR", etc. will automatically be
generated.  \fIName\fR can be any string.  Labels are non-unique.  A
parent can contain two nodes with the same label. Nodes can be
relabeled using \fBBlt_TreeRelabelNode\fR.
.TP
\fIposition\fR
Position the parent's list of children to insert the new node.  For
example, if \fIposition\fR is 0, then the new node is prepended to the
beginning of the list.  If \fIposition\fR is -1, then the node is
appended onto the end of the parent's list.
.PP
.SH RETURNS
The new node returned is of type \fBBlt_TreeNode\fR.  It's a token
that can be used with other routines to add/delete data values or
children nodes.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example creates a new node from the root node.
.CS
Blt_Tree token;
Blt_TreeNode root, node;

if (Blt_TreeGetToken(interp, "myTree", &token) != TCL_OK) {
    return TCL_ERROR;
}
root = Blt_TreeRootNode(token);
node = Blt_TreeCreateNode(token, root, "myNode", -1);
.CE
.SH NOTIFICATIONS
\fBBlt_TreeCreateNode\fR can trigger tree notify events.
You can be notified whenever a node is created by using the
\fBBlt_TreeCreateNotifyHandler\fR.  A callback routine is registered
that will be automatically invoked whenever a new node is added
via \fBBlt_TreeCreateNode\fR to the tree.
