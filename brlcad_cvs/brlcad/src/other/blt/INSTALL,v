@This file describes how to compile and install the BLT library for UNIX.
[See the file ./win/README for details on how to build under Win32.]

1. Uncompress and untar the distribution file.

	zcat BLT2.4.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

   This will create a directory "blt2.4" with the following subdirectories:

     		   blt2.4
      	______________|_____________________________
     	|       |       |      |      |    | 	   |
      demos  examples  html library  man  src	  win
        |		      	           |       |
     scripts			         shared   X11

2. Run ./configure

   Go into the "blt2.4" directory

        cd blt2.4

   and run the auto-configuration script "./configure".  Tell where to find
   the Tcl and Tk header files and libraries with the "--with-tcl" switch.

        ./configure --with-tcl=/util/lang/tcl

       Switches:

       --prefix=path	Specifies the path where "bltwish", the BLT
     			header files, libraries, scripts, and manual
     			pages are installed. The default is
			"/usr/local/blt".

                        This switch also indicates where to find the
			Tcl/Tk header files and libraries. You can use
			the --with-tcl and --with-tk switches to override
			this value if the location of the Tcl/Tk files
			is different.

       --with-tcl=dir	Directory where Tcl and/or Tk is installed.

       --with-tk=dir	Directory where Tk is installed	if different
			from "--with-tcl".

       --with-cc=program  Lets you specify the C compiler, such as
     			  "acc" or "gcc".

  The configure script creates a header file "src/bltConfig.h". It will also
  generate new Makefiles from their respective templates (Makefile.in).

        Makefile.in 	        ==> Makefile
        src/Makefile.in	        ==> src/Makefile
        src/shared/Makefile.in	==> src/shared/Makefile
        man/Makefile.in		==> man/Makefile
        library/Makefile.in	==> library/Makefile

3. Compile the libraries and build the demonstration program "bltwish".

        make

   The program "bltwish" will be created in the ./src directory.

4. Test by running the demos.

   Go into the demos directory

        cd demos

   and run the test scripts.

        ./graph1.tcl

   If your system doesn't support "#!" in shell scripts, then it's

        ../src/bltwish ./graph1.tcl


5. Installing BLT

       make install

   The following directories will be created when BLT is installed.
   By default, the top directory is /usr/local/blt.

           ___________|__________
           |     |        |     |
          bin  include   lib   man
                          |
                        blt2.4
                      ____|____
                      |       |
                    demos   dd_protocols

   You can change the top directory by supplying the "--prefix=dir" switch
   to ./configure.

*6. (Optional) Compiling BLT into your own custom "wish".

   [If your version of "wish" supports dynamic loading of packages
   you can simply add

         package require BLT

   to the start of your script.]

   Add the following lines to your program's Tcl_AppInit routine in
   tkAppInit.c

        if (Blt_Init(interp) != TCL_OK) {
            return TCL_ERROR;
        }

   then link with libBLT.a.  And that's all there's to it.

2. Run ./configure

   Go into the "blt2.4" directory 

        cd blt2.4

   and run the auto-configuration script "./configure".  Tell where to find 
   the Tcl and Tk header files and libraries with the "--with-tcl" switch.

        ./configure --with-tcl=/util/lang/tcl

       Switches:

       --prefix=path	Specifies the path where "bltwish", the BLT
     			header files, libraries, scripts, and manual
     			pages are installed. The default is 
			"/usr/local/blt".  

                        This switch also indicates where to find the 
			Tcl/Tk header files and libraries. You can use

       --with-tcl=dir	Directory where Tcl and/or Tk is installed.

       --with-tk=dir	Directory where Tk is installed	if different 
			from "--with-tcl".

       --with-cc=program  Lets you specify the C compiler, such as 
     			  "acc" or "gcc". 

  The configure script creates a header file "src/bltConfig.h". It will also 
  generate new Makefiles from their respective templates (Makefile.in).

        Makefile.in 	        ==> Makefile
        src/Makefile.in	        ==> src/Makefile
        src/shared/Makefile.in	==> src/shared/Makefile
        man/Makefile.in		==> man/Makefile
        library/Makefile.in	==> library/Makefile

3. Compile the libraries and build the demonstration program "bltwish".

        make 

   The program "bltwish" will be created in the ./src directory.

4. Test by running the demos. 

   Go into the demos directory 

        cd demos

   and run the test scripts.  

        ./graph1.tcl

   If your system doesn't support "#!" in shell scripts, then it's

        ../src/bltwish ./graph1.tcl


5. Installing BLT

       make install

   The following directories will be created when BLT is installed.  
   By default, the top directory is /usr/local/blt.  
                  
           ___________|__________

          bin  include   lib   man
                          |
                        blt2.4   
                      ____|____
                      |       |
                    demos   dd_protocols

   You can change the top directory by supplying the "--prefix=dir" switch 
   to ./configure.

*6. (Optional) Compiling BLT into your own custom "wish".

   [If your version of "wish" supports dynamic loading of packages
   you can simply add

         package require BLT

   Add the following lines to your program's Tcl_AppInit routine in
   tkAppInit.c
