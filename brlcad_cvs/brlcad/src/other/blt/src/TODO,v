To do:

bgexec (Windows)
  1. (BUG) Convert collected data to UTF before passing to the interpreter.

container (Unix)
  1. (done) Add timeout option to control how long to search for application
            window.

debug
  1. (done) Recent versions of Tcl swamp Tcl_CommandTrace.
            Add line cutoff option (default is 6).

dnd (Unix)
  1. (DOC) Create manual page for "dnd" command.
  2. (Feature) Add Motif drag-and-drop capabilities.

eps
  1. (DOC) Update manual page for eps canvas item.
  2. (FEATURE) Read Windows EPS files with embedded TIFF images.

graph
  1. (done) Fix zooming graph procedure to handle multiple axes.
  2. (BUG) Windows printing commands "print1" and "print2" need to use
     postscript options like -maxpect, -pad, etc. to control graph
     size.
  3. (BUG) No PostScript generated for polygon tiling.
  4. (BUG) Clip background polygon for text/bitmap markers.
  5. (FEATURE) Add -mask option for bitmap marker.
  6. (FEATURE) Allow rotated image markers.
  7. (FEATURE) Add oval and rectangle markers.
  8. (FEATURE) Add arrowheads to line markers.
  9. (BUG) Finish adding error bars.
 10. (DOC) Review and update documentation for new typos, new features.
 11. (BUG) Store converted screen coordinates in floating point. Can't
	   use integer coordinates for higher resolution PostScript
	   devices. How do Windows' print devices handle this?

hierbox
  1. (CHANGE) Hierbox to use tree object for data.  The -data option will
              be a field in the tree.
  2. (FEATURE) Add edit bindings for entries.
  3. (DOCUMENTATION) Create real hierbox manual page.

hiertable
  1. (done) -tree option dumps core.
  2. (done) Sorting tree view affects all other hiertables using the tree.
            Is separate data structure needed for non-flattened sorts?  What
            about moves?
  3. (done) Call tree update procedure when tree object is sorted.  This
            is only when a tree is shared between more than one hiertable.
            It goes out-of-sync with actual tree positions.
  4. (CHANGE) "column resize set" should change the width of the active
            column automatically.
  5a.(FEATURE) XOR outline for entry move operation.
  5b.(FEATURE) XOR outline for entry resize operation.
  6a.(done) XOR outline for column resize operation.
  6b.(FEATURE) XOR outline for column move operation.
  7. (???) Update procedure isn't called for moved nodes.  Call global
           update routine (like sort) or selected node update procedures?
  8. (DOC) Explain selection modes ("single" and "multiple")
           in manual page.
  9. (BUG) Multi-line entry editting is broken.
 10. (BUG) Add default bindings for entry editting. Need to set grab
     on edit window.
 11. (BUG) Add standard keyboard bindings.
 12. (FEATURE) Images in column title.
 13. (PERFORMANCE) Don't redraw entire widget for scrolling.  Copy
                   portions of pixmap and redraw only changed areas.
	           This will affect lots of code.
 14. (PERFORMANCE) Don't redraw entire widget for selections.  Draw
	           only changed entries.
 15. (???) Add checkbox column entries.
 16. (BUG) "column resize" reports incorrect width of column.

printer (Windows)
  1. (DOC) Create manual page for "printer" command.
  2. (FEATURE) Add operation to print text and canvas widgets.
  3. (FEATURE) Create sample print dialog.
  4. (BUG) Needs print job abort handler.

tabset
  1. (done) Add perforation gizmo for tearoffs.
  2. (FEATURE) Allow alternatative tearout styles.

tree
  1. (done) Create Tcl interface.
  2. (DOC) Create manuals for both Tcl and C APIs.

vector
  1. (FEATURE) Add Tcl-based notification callbacks.

gradient
  1. (FEATURE) Create gradient command that interfaces with tiling.
