@ah crap.  the converter uses libwdb which isn't/can't be compiled before src/other -- one of the few ways where recursive make actually bites us in the arse.  need to move the converter to a directory that is traversed after src/other and after src/lib*, maybe misc/intaval or contrib/intaval or src/contrib/intaval etc.  for now, just make the converter be compile-on-demand (i.e. cd src/other/intaval && make tgf-g) only.

@ah, blasted automake (or my assumptions of it).  just include the opennurbs cppflags here since c++ files are still in the minority.
