1.1
log
@update of the bundled zlib from version 1.2.2 to 1.2.3; per the zlib website, this eliminates a potential security vulnerability when decoding invalid compressed data (VU#238678 / SA11129) as well as eliminates a potential security vulnerability when decoding specially crafted compressed data (VU#680620 / SA15949). other updates included, see the zlib release notes for details.
