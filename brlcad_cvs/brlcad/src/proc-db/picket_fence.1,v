.SH NAME
pickett_fence \- Pickett fence geometry file generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pickett_fence
<filename> <prefix> <height> <spacing> <x0> <y0> <z0> ... <xn> <yn> <zn> [-r]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pickett_fence\^
creates a geometry file in
.I <filename>\^
of a pickett fence.  All parameters for the fence are in mm.  If more than two
points are specified it will generate a fence with multiple sections connecting
the points.  Parts of the fence are created starting at the origin.  The
two backing boards are created in the negative x halfspace.  The pickets are
created in the positive x halfspace and translated down the y-axis to their
proper positions.  The entire segment is then rotated and translated to the
position specified by the user.  To create a box of fence with the
picketts on the outside, the points must be specified in a counter-clockwise
order.  Parts of the model are named according to the format
.RS
<prefix><partname><sec_num>[-<part_num>].<obj_type>
.RE
The
.I <prefix>\^
above is the second argument to the program.  The
.I spacing\^
parameter specifies the ammount of space (in mm) between picketts.  The
.I -r\^
option specifies round fronts for the picketts.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following will create a pickett fence two meters high and six meters long
with fifteen millimeter spaces between the picketts.  It will start at
the origin and extend to the point (100, 6000, 0).

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@renamed from pickett to picket.  although George Edward Pickett might have passed some picket fences during his failed charge at the Battle of Gettysburg, I doubt these fences are his.
