@woo hoo, finally got through most of the flawfinder level 4 issues related to string buffer limits (leaving issues that can probably/mostly be ignored).  these changes mostly invovlved using the n-variants of the various string processing functions so that the buffers being written to are properly clamped.

@more c89 embracing.  c89 provides string.h for all of the various str*() and mem*() functions, so remove the check for its presence.  there is still likely to be work required for strict c89 conformance for the various bsd strings.h functions that may be in use.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
