@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@to quote Bob's commit to src/archer/archer "All of archer including the tclscripts is assigned to u.s. government and should be under the LGPL" so add the boilerplate legal header and remove the survice claim.  the COPYING file requires this as well.  also add the boilerplate variables footer while we're at it.
