.SH NAME
mac\(hypix \- convert Apple MacPaint bitmap into pix(5) or bw(5) raster image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mac-pix
.RB [ \-clb ]
.RB [ \-s\  squareMacSize]
.RB [ \-w\  Mac_width]
.RB [ \-n\  Mac_height]
.RB [ \-x\  Mac_xoff]
.RB [ \-y\  Mac_yoff]
.RB [ \-X\  output_xoff]
.RB [ \-Y\  output_yoff]
.RB [ \-S\  squareOutputSize]
.RB [ \-W\  output_width]
.RB [ \-N\  output_height]
.RB [ \-C\  r/g/b]
[file.mac]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mac-pix
reads an Apple MacIntosh MacPaint bitmap file and generates a
.IR pix (5)
or
.IR bw (5)
raster image file.
While the MacPaint file is 720x576 pixels, it is possible to specify
an alternate size input file with the
.B \-s
.B \-w
and
.B \-n
flags;  the usefulness of this is unknown.
By default, the output
.IR pix (5)
file is 1024x1024 pixels, with the input image located in the lower
left corner of the output (nearest the origin).  The default color for
an "on" pixel is white (R=G=B=255); alternatively, the
.B \-C r/g/b
flag can be used to specify intensities for each of the colors, in
the range of [0..255].
The
.B \-b
flag will output a
.IR bw (5)
black and white file instead.
By specifying the
.B \-c
flag, the input image is centered in the middle of the output image.
By specifying the
.B \-l
flag, the default output size is changed to 512x512.
Alternatively, the
.B \-S
flag can be used to specify the square output size, or
.B \-W
and
.B \-N
flags can be used to specify the otuput width and height.
If no input file is specified, standard input is read instead.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Especially pleasing displays of MacPaint documents can be made by using
.IR pixmerge (1)
to combine them with the output of
.IR pixbackgnd (1):
.br
.ft I
pixbackgnd -h 160 200 > bg.pix
.br
mac-pix -c file.mac | pixmerge \(em bg.pix | pix-fb
.ft R

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
