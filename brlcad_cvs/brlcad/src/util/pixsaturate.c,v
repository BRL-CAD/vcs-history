/** @@file pixsaturate.c
 *
 *  A saturation value of 0 gives monochrome,
 *  1.0 gives the original image,
 *  and values larger than 1.0 give a more saturated image.
 *
 *  Author -
 *	Michael John Muuss
 *	(based on a subroutine by Paul Haeberli)
 *
 *  Remarks from Haeberli's routine:
 *	saturate-
 *		Change the saturation of a row of pixels.  If sat is
 *	set to 0.0 the result will be monochromatic, if sat is made
 *	1.0, the color will not change, if sat is made greater than 1.0,
 *	the amount of color is increased.
 *
 *	The input and output pixel values are in the range 0..255.
 *
 *	This technique requires 6 multiplies, 5 adds and 3 bound
 *	checks per pixel.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
