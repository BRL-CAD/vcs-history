.SH NAME
bary \- compute weighted sums of points
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "bary  [ -nt ] [ -s " "'x y z'" " ] [ " "file" " ] "
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bary
computes weighted sums of a set of sites in Euclidean 3-space,
writing them on the standard output.
The site weights are read from
.I file
if it is specified;
otherwise,
.I bary
reads from the standard input.
A line of input must be either
(1) entirely white space,
(2) white space followed by a comment (begun with the '#' character),
or (3) white-space-separated weights, one per site.

By default,
.I bary
uses the three sites (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1).
One or more occurences of the
.B -s
option cause
.I bary
to replace
the default sites with all the sites
(\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIz\fR)
.\".RI "(" "x" ", " "y" ", " "z" ")" " " "huh?"
so specified.

The
.B -n
option causes
.I bary
to normalize each tuple of weights to sum to one.
This has the effect of computing
barycentric combinations of the sites.

If any line of weights in the input stream
contains more fields than the number of sites,
.I bary
will, by default,
ignore the excess fields.
The
.B -t
option causes
.I bary
to copy all such trailing fields verbatim onto the tail of
the corresponding line of output.

.SH EXAMPLE
The command

.nf
.in +4
bary -tn -s '0 0 0' -s '1 0 0' -s '0.5 0.866 0' <<EOF
#------------------------------
# x   y   z     aux. data
#------------------------------
 1.0 2.5 3.6    58 alpha
 0.0 1.0 2.0    37 bravo
13.0 9.2 6.3    69 charlie delta
EOF
.in -4
.fi

maps the triples to points in an equilateral triangle in the \fIxy\fR-plane,
producing the following output:

.nf
.in +4
0.605634 0.439099 0    58 alpha
0.666667 0.577333 0    37 bravo

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
