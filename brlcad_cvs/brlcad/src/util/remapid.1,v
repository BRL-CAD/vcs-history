.SH NAME
remapid \- reassign region idents in a BRL-CAD or TANKILL model according to commands in a specification file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B remapid
.RB [\-{g|t}] {file.g|file.tankill} [spec_file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Performs batch modifications of region IDs for BRL-CAD
(or TANKILL) geometry.
The program reads a .g (or TANKILL) file and a spec file
indicating which region IDs to change to which new values.
For a .g file, the specified changes are made to that file;
For a TANKILL file, a modified model is written to stdout.
The remapping assignment is read from a specification file
containing commands, the grammar for which looks something like:
.nf

command  --> id_list ':' id
id_list  --> id_block | id_block ',' id_list
id_block --> id | id '-' id
id       --> [0-9]+

.fi
The semantics of a command is:  For every region in the database
whose region ID appears in the id_list before the ':', change its
region ID to the value appearing after the ':'.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
