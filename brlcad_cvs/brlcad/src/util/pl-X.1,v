.SH NAME
pl\(hyX \- display UnixPlot in an X Window (X11)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pl-X
.RB [ \-v ]
< unix_plot
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pl-X
displays an extended UnixPlot file on any workstation running the
X Window System (X11R2).  As with all X programs, the selected
display is determined from the
.B
.SM DISPLAY
environment variable.
.PP
The
.B \-v
verbose option causes descriptions of the plot commands to be
printed.
.SH BUGS
This is just the bare bones of a display program at the time
of this writing.  It needs the ability to rotate, translate, zoom, etc.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
pl-X10(1), pl-fb(1), pl-sgi(1), pl-pl(1), plot3(5).

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
