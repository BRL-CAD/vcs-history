# Description -
#	helper proc to build input files for the "prj" shader
#
# Modifications -
#	Bob Parker:
#	     Added code to prompt user for input using the
#		   "more arguments needed::" hack.
#	     Replaced combination of "puts" and return with "error"
#		   so that a calling script will know an error occured.
#
# Usage: prj_add shaderfile image_filename image_width image_height
#

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
