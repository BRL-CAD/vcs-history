.SH DESCRIPTION
This library exists to permit writing MGED databases from
arbitrary procedures.
Some of the high-level structure of MGED databases (eg, that
they start with an ID record, and that COMB records must be
followed immediately by MEMBER records) is currently implicit
in the calling routines.
This library is by no means complete, and routines for writing every
type of solid do not yet exist.
While it is expected that this library will grow and change as
experience is gained, it is not clear what direction that evolution
will take.  Be prepared for changes in the interface to some of these
routines in future releases.
All routines take as their first argument the stdio FILE pointer
(eg, stdout) on which the generated MGED database record(s) will
be written with fwrite().
.PP
.I mk_id\^
fwrites an IDENT record on the indicated stdio file, with the string
.I title\^
associated.  Note that to have a valid database, the
the first record written must have been an IDENT record such as
written by this routine.
.PP
.I mk_half\^
makes a halfspace with name ``name''.  It is specified by
the distance ``d'' from the origin, and the outward pointing
normal vector ``norm''.
.PP
.I mk_rpp\^
makes an ARB8 called ``name''
specified as a right rectangular parallelepiped in
terms of a minimum point ``min'' and a maximum point ``max''.
.PP
.I mk_wedge\^
makes a right angular wedge called ``name'' specified by
a starting vertex located in the lower left corner of the solid, an x-direction
vector, a z-direction vector, an x-length, a y-length, a z-length, and
a top x-length.  The y-direction vector is the result of x-direction vector
cross z-direction vector.
All vertices are make in the counterclockwise direction,
bottom face first.  The top face is made by extruding the bottom face in
the z direction.
.PP
.I mk_arb4\^
makes an ARB8 called ``name''
described as an ARB4, ie, by 4 points, the first 3 of which
lie on a plane, and the fourth is the ``peak''.
.PP
.I mk_arb8\^
makes an ARB8 called ``name''
described by an array of 8 points in ``pts''.
All plates with 4 points must be co-planar.
If there are degeneracies (ie, all 8 vertices are not distinct),
then certain requirements must be met.
If we think of the ARB8 as having a top and a bottom plate,
the first four points listed must lie on one plate, and
the second four points listed must lie on the other plate.
.PP
.I mk_sph\^
makes a spherical ellipsoid called ``name''
centered at point ``center'' with radius ``radius''.
.I mk_ell\^
makes an ellipsoid called ``name'' centered at point ``center''
with three perpendicular radius vectors.
The eccentricity of the ellipsoid is controlled by the relative
lengths of the three radius vectors.
.PP
.I mk_tgc\^
makes a truncated general cone called ``name'' with the base plate
centered at ``center'' and a height vector ``height'', which is
perpendicular to the two end plates.  The length of the height vector
defines the location of the top plate.  The vectors ``a'' and ``b''
are the base radius vectors, and the vectors ``c'' and ``d'' are the
nose vectors.
.PP
.I mk_tor\^
makes a torus called ``name'' centered at point ``center'',
with the torus lying in a plane with normal ``n''.
Radius ``r1'' is the distance from the center point of the torus
to the center of the solid part, and radius ``f2'' is
the radius of the solid part.
.PP
.I mk_cone\^
makes a right circular cone called ``name''
specified by the center point of the base, a direction or height vector,
a height scalar, and a radius for each end of the cone.
The direction vector is unitized and serves to derive a vector
``a'', which is orthogonal to the direction vector and itself.  This vector
is scaled by both radii to obtain two of four vectors required to make a
cone.  It is then crossed with the unitized direction vector, and the
result thereof is scaled by both radii as well to obtain the last of four
vectors needed to make a cone.
.PP
.I mk_rcc\^
makes a truncated general cone (TGC) with name ``name''
specified as a right circular cylinder.
The base plate of the cylinder is centered at ``base'',
with height vector ``height'' which is perpendicular to
the two end plates, the length of which defines the location of
the top plate.
The radius given as ``radius'' defines the size of the end plates.
.PP
.I mk_pipe
creates a ``pipe'' solid with the specified ``name'' and writes it to the
file ``fp''.  The user must provide a linked list of ``pipe''
segments headed by ``headp''.  Each pipe segment includes fields indicating a
``control'' point for the pipe, an inner diameter, an outer diameter and a bend radius.
The inner diameter must be less than the outer diameter, and a zero innner diameter
creates a solid wire rather than a hollow pipe.  The pipe is constructed along straight
lines through successive points, with circular bends (of the indicated radius) connecting
the straight sections. The bend radius must be greater than the outer radius. The user
is responsible for freeing the memory used by the list of pipe segments (see
.I mk_pipe_free()
below.
.PP
.I mk_pipe_free
will free the memory used by a linked list of pipe segments. This does not free the list head.
.PP
.I mk_pipe_init
initializes a linked list of pipe segments with the initial point,
inside diameter, outside diameter, and bend radius.
.PP
.I mk_add_pipe_pt
adds another pipe segment to the list with the indicated point,
outside radius, inside radius, and bend radius.
.PP
.I mk_comb\^
defines a combination of name ``name'', with material properties
information included.
``len'' indicated the number of
.I mk_memb\^
calls (MEMB records) that will immediately follow.
``region'' is a boolean that is set to mark this combination
as a region.
``matname'' is either a NULL pointer, or a pointer to a string
containing the material property name.
``matparm'' is either a NULL pointer, or a pointer to a string
containing the material property parameter information,
which is material-specific (and still experimental).
Color is passed as an array of three unsigned chars in ``rgb''.
Color ``inherit'' is a boolean, and if true, the color and material
properties will be passed from upper-level objects to lower-level
objects.
.I mk_fcomb\^
makes a simple combination header, with name ``name'', length ``len'',
and the boolean ``region''.  It functions just like
.IR mk_comb\^ .
``len''
.I mk_memb\^
calls must immediately follow the call to
.I mk_comb\^
or
.IR mk_fcomb\^ .
Each call to
.I mk_memb\^
adds a reference to object ``name'' to the combination.
It is transformed by the 4x4 matrix ``mat'', and is combined
by boolean operation ``op'', chosen from
the list of:  UNION, INTERSECT, SUBTRACT, from <brlcad/db.h>.
.PP
.I mk_addmember\^
is used to obtain dynamic storage for a new wmember structure
(see
.IR wdb.h\^
).  Then
.I mk_lcomb\^
can be used in the same way as
.I mk_comb\^
to make a combination of a linked list of wmember structures.
This is the only recommended way to create combinations,
because it collects up the details in memory, and produces the
combination and member records all at once, rather than in multiple
calls, as in
.I mk_comb\^
and
.I mk_memb\^.
The ``op'' argument must be one of
WMOP_UNION, WMOP_SUBTRACT, or WMOP_INTERSECT.
In the future,
.I mk_comb\^
and
.I mk_memb\^
will no longer be supported.
.I mk_lfcomb\^
is the linked list equivalent of
.I mk_fcomb\^.
Note that the linked list heads must be initialized by an
invocation of BU_LIST_INIT( &head.l );
.PP
.I mk_polysolid\^
writes the header record for a polygon solid called ``name'',
which must be immediately
followed by one or more
.I mk_poly\^
calls before using any other
.I mk_*\^
routines.
.I mk_poly\^
is called with ``npts'' (3 to 5) vertices in the ``vert'' array,
with a matching number of normals in the ``norm'' array.
All vertices must be coplanar.
For the present, note that librt/pg.c only uses the first normal
in the ``norm'' array, although the intention is to do optional
normal interpolation for those occasions where it may be desirable
to have curved-looking polygons.
.I mk_fpoly\^
is like
.I mk_poly\^
except no normals are given.  It is a ``fast'' or ``flat'' form
of the poly routine.  This function computes normals for you from
the given vertices by assuming a counter clockwise ordering of the
vertices as viewed from the top (outside).
.PP
The routine
.I mk_bsolid\^
writes the header for a b-spline solid ``name'', with ``nsurf'' surfaces,
at ``res'' resolution.  This call must be followed by ``nsurf''
calls to
.I mk_bsurf\^
which enters the respective surfaces into the combination.  This pair
work much like the
.I mk_comb\^
and
.I mk_memb\^
pair.
.PP
The global variable
.I mk_version\^
may be set to 4 or 5, depending on which format BRL-CAD database
you wish to write.
By default, the most recent version is always created.
.SH EXAMPLE(S)

.SH BUGS
The library is incomplete.
The need for the application to know higher-level details
is unfortunate, but necessary to keep the library simple.
We may pay for this later.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
