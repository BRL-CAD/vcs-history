.SH NAME
reshoot \- re-shoot rays and compare results
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B reshoot
model.g objects ... < raylist
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is designed to shoot a set of rays and compare the results with previous results.
The program exits with a non-zero status if any rays are different from the previous run,
and a 0 status if no differences were found.


.P
Typically, an application (probably other than
.I reshoot\fR)
is run with the RT_G_DEBUG flag DEBUG_ALLHITS set.
This will cause librt to log all calls to the application \fIhit\fR routine to the standard error.
The logged output can be processed by an
.I awk
program to produce input to
.I reshoot\fR.
Consider the file p.awk with the following contents:
.P
.in +5
.nf
/Pnt/ { START=index($0,"(") + 1
       STR=substr($0, START, index($0,")") - START)
       gsub(  ", "  , "," , STR)
       printf "Pnt=%s\n",STR
       }
/Dir/ { START=index($0,"(") + 1
       STR=substr($0, START, index($0,")") - START)
       gsub(  ", "  , "," , STR)
       printf "Dir=%s\n",STR
       }
/PT/  { PIN=$3; POUT=$5 }
/InHIT/ { INHIT=$2 }
/OutHIT/ { OUTHIT=$2 }
/Region/ { printf "\tregion=%s in=%s in%s out=%s out%s\n",
	$2,PIN,INHIT,POUT,OUTHIT
	}
.fi
.P
Given this
.I awk
program The log file from the application can be processed as follows:
.IP
awk -f p.awk < logfile > shotlist
.P
to produce input for
.I reshoot\fR.
An example of the input file format for
.I reshoot
is:
.P
.in +5
.nf
Pnt=0,0,1
Dir=0,0,-1
	region=r1.r in=p1.s indist=10016.8 out=p2.s outdist=10017.8
	region=r2.r in=p3.s indist=10018.8 out=p4.s outdist=10019.8
	\fI... (arbitrary many region lines)\fR
Pnt=0,0,10
Dir=0,0,-1
	region=r1.r in=p1.s indist=10016.8 out=p2.s outdist=10017.8
	region=r2.r in=p3.s indist=10018.8 out=p4.s outdist=10019.8
	\fI... (arbitrary many region lines)\fR
.fi
.P
There can be an arbitrary number of rays specified in the file.
There must not be whitespace between the values of Pnt and Dir.
It is best to comma separate the three coordinat values.
The keywords "Pnt" and "Dir" must occur atthe begining of a line.
There can be an arbitrary number of regions along the ray path.
Each region must be described on a single line.
A new ray is started by a "Pnt" value.
Then
.I reshoot
can be run as follows:
.IP
reshoot geom.g obj ... < shotlist
.P
Differences are reported for each ray as they are found:

.in +5
Ray Pt 0,0,1 Dir 0,0,-1
	inhit mismatch 17.8177 16.8
	outhit mismatch 24.7685 23.8
	region name mismatch /oops.r sb r1.r
	in primitive name mismatch p8.s sb p1.s


.SH BUGS
The floating point values logged when the DEBUG_ALLHITS flag is set in RT_G_DEBUG are printed with a %g format.
This causes some truncation of precision.  This is accounted for by
.I reshoot
by re-formatting the numbers computed into ascii and re-parsing them back in.
This causes the same amount of precision loss as the original values
have undergone.  However, small actual differences are also overlooked
as a result.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

log
@This is an application for re-shooting rays and comparing the results
to previous applicatin runs.  The princiiple use will probably be
in the regression test suite.  In that context, it should allow us
to shoot all the MUVES test suite rays outside of MUVES.  The one downside
is that it relies on the RT_G_DEBUG flag DEBUG_ALLHITS to cause librt
to log the original rays.  Since floating point values are logged with %g some
precision is lost.
