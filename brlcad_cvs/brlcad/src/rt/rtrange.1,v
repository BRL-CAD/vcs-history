.SH NAME
rtrange \(em raytraces a model and visualizes range data in a UNIX-Plot file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtrange
[ options ... ]
model.g
objects ...
> model.pl
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rtrange
operates on the indicated
.I objects
in the input
.I model.g
and produces a range data UNIX-Plot file of the geometry ray-traced.  The
algorithm is based on plotting hit distances for all the pixels ray-traced.
The output is in the versatile, machine independent, UNIX-Plot file format.
This file is a true vector plot which retains the original model units.
.LP
The orientation of the rays to be fired may be specified by
the
.B \-a
and
.B \-e
options, in which case the model will be autosized, and the grid
will be centered on the centroid of the model, with ray spacing
chosen to span the entire set of
.I objects.
Alternatively,
with the
.B \-M
option, a transformation matrix may be provided on standard input
which maps model-space to view-space.
In this case, the grid ranges from -1.0 <= X,Y <= +1.0 in view space,
with the size of the grid (number of rays fired) specified with
.B \-s.
This option is most useful when
.B rtrange
is being invoked from a shell script created by an
.IR mged (1)
\fIsaveview\fR command.
.LP
The following options are recognized.
.TP
.B \-s#
Number of rays to fire in X and Y directions (square grid).
Default is 512 (512x512).
.TP
.B \-a#
Select azimuth in degrees.  Used with
.B \-e
and conflicts with
.B \-M
.TP
.B \-e#
Select elevation in degrees.  Used with
.B \-a
and conflicts with
.B \-M
.TP
.B \-M
Read model2view matrix from standard input.
Conflicts with
.B \-a
and
.B \-e
.TP
.B \-U #
sets the Boolean variable
.I use_air
to the given value.
.TP
.B \-o
.B output.pl
specifies a named file for output.
By default, the plot is written to standard out.
.SH EXAMPLE
This section shows the ordinary usage of \fIrtrange\fR.  For example,

.nf
	\fIrtrange -s32 model.g all.g > file.pl\fR
.fi

results in a 32 by 32 range data UNIX-plot file of the named model.
.LP
The plotfile resulting from an \fIrtrange\fR can be viewed directly
via \fIpl-sgi\fR:

.nf
	\fIpl-sgi file.pl\fR
.fi

It can also be rotated by \fBplrot\fR and sent to a framebuffer:

.nf
	\fIplrot -a# -e# -g file.pl | pl-fb\fR
.fi

Likewise, it can be overlayed onto a solid model in \fImged\fR:

.nf
	\fImged>\fR
	\fIoverlay hide.pl\fR
.fi

.SH "SEE ALSO"

pl-sgi(1), plrot(1),  rt(1), rtray(1),
librt(3), libplot3(3), plot3(5), ray(5V).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Numerous error conditions are possible, usually due to errors in
the geometry database.
Descriptive messages are printed on standard error (file descriptor 2).

.SH BUGS
.LP
Most deficiencies observed while using the
.B rtrange
program are usually with the
.IR librt (3)
package instead.
.SH "BUG REPORTS"
Reports of bugs or problems should be submitted via electronic
mail to <devs@@brlcad.org>.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
