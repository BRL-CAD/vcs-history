.SH NAME
rtregis \(em register overlay of a UNIX-Plot onto a rendered image.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtregis
plot.log pix.log
> regtistration.matrix
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I rtregis
makes it easy and fast to overlay a UNIX-Plot file produced with \fBrthide\fR
or \fBrtrange\fR onto its equivalent color shaded image produced with \fBrt\fR or \fBcell-fb\fR.
.LP
.I rtregis
produces a script containing a call to \fBplrot\fR with the \fB-m\fR and \fB-S\fR parameters to
supply it with a registration matrix and a space command.  The registration
matrix is produced by \fBrtregis\fR from the
.B RT
log files for a UNIX-Plot file and a rendered shaded image file.
Both the UNIX-Plot image and the rendered shaded image must have been
ray-traced from the same orientation.  The output from
.B rtregis
is a matrix and a space command that are to be used as input parameters
to
.B plrot.
They may not be used together with
.B \-a, \-e, \-s, \-g
options to
.B plrot.
Output is written to standard out unless it is redirected.
The output can often be included directly in a shell script using
grave accents.
.SH EXAMPLE
This section shows the ordinary usage of \fIrtregis\fR.  For example,

.nf
	\fIrtregis plot.log pix.log  > registration.matrix.file\fR
.fi

results in a file containing the registration matrix and alternate
space command for \fBplrot\fR.  It also contains a call to \fBplrot\fR and
can be edited to send the \fBplrot\fR output a file.

.nf
	 \fIsh registration.matrix.file > file.pl\fR
.fi

This results in a registered plot file.
.LP
Now the registered plot file can be overlaid onto the rendered shaded image:

.nf
	\fIpix-fb file.pix\fR
	\fIpl-fb -o file.pl\fR
.fi

This command pair results in the plot file being overlaid on top of
the rendered shaded image that was in the framebuffer.
The result can then be converted to Impress or PostScript and sent
to a printer:

.nf
	\fIfb-pix | pix-bw | bw-impress (or bw-ps) | qpr\fR
.fi

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
