.SH NAME
rtarea \- Calculate exposed and presented surface areas
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rtarea
[ options ... ]
model.g
objects ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rtarea
calculates the exposed and presented surface areas of specified
geometry objects from a particular view.  The summary output includes
details for individual regions, assemblies (combinations that contain
regions), and summarized totals.  The exposed area is the occluded 2D
projection of the specified geometry.  That is to say that if another
object is in front, it will reduce the amount of exposed area.  The
presented area is the unoccluded 2D projection of the geometry, where
hidden objects will report their presented area regardless of any
objects that are in front.
.PP
It presently does not compute the entire surface area of objects
displayed though that would be a nice feature to have.
.PP
The model geometry is the list of
.I objects
in the input database
.IR model.g .
.TP
.B \-X\ #
Set rtarea debug flags to a (hexadecimal) number.
A flag value of 1 causes 3-D plot output to be written to stdout.
All solid RPPs are plotted as grey boxes, and the walk path is
in alternating blue and green segments.
A flag value of 2 adds red segments for all attempted steps,
as well as the final steps.
A flag value of 3 adds some debugging prints to stderr in addition
to the plots.  This is useful for immediate path review, eg,
.sp .5
	rtarea -X 1 ... | tiris
.TP
.B \-x\ #
Set librt debug flags to a (hexadecimal) number.
.TP
.B \-n\ # of steps
.LP
The
.B rtarea
program employs
.IR librt (3)
for the geometry interrogation.
.sp
.SH "SEE ALSO"
mged(1), rt(1), pix-fb(1), librt(3), pix(5).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Numerous error conditions are possible.
Descriptive messages are printed on standard error.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
