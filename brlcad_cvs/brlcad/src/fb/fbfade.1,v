.SH SYNOPSIS
.CW fbfade
[
.CW -h
] [

.I "input image name"
] [
.CW -s
.I "input square size"
] [

.br
	[ [

.I "output frame buffer name"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.CW fbfade
gradually displays an image on a frame buffer,
one randomly chosen pixel at a time.
.SS Options
.TP "\w'\f\*(pf-F\fP \fIoutput frame buffer name\fP\ \ \ 'u"
.CW -h
(``high resolution'')\
Assumes 1024 by 1024 pixels for default input image size
instead of 512 by 512.
Explicitly specified sizes override the default,
and if actual input image size is smaller than requested,
the actual size will be used.
If output frame buffer size is not specified,
the revised input size will be requested for output.
If actual output frame buffer size is greater than requested,
only the lower-left portion of the frame buffer will be used.
Actual sizes depend on details of specific frame buffers.
.TP
\f\*(pf-f\fP \fIinput image name\fP
Inputs the image to be displayed
from the specified frame buffer or \fIpix\^\fP(\*(fs) file,
instead of using pure background
(which fades out the image already
on the output frame buffer).
.TP
\f\*(pf-s\fP \fIinput square size\fP
Specifies input image width and height.
.TP
\f\*(pf-w\fP \fIinput width\fP
Specifies input image width.
.TP
\f\*(pf-n\fP \fIinput height\fP
Specifies input image height.
.TP
\f\*(pf-S\fP \fIoutput square size\fP
Specifies output frame buffer width and height.
.TP
\f\*(pf-W\fP \fIoutput width\fP
Specifies output frame buffer width.
.TP
\f\*(pf-N\fP \fIoutput height\fP
Specifies output frame buffer height.
.TP
\f\*(pf-F\fP \fIoutput frame buffer name\fP
Outputs to the specified frame buffer
instead of the one specified by the
.CW FB_FILE
environment variable
(or the default, if
.CW FB_FILE
is not set).
If this is the last option specified, the
.CW -F
is optional.
.SH CAVEAT
.CW fbfade
works best in conjunction with a frame buffer having very fast access to pixels.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following shell script can be used to produce a slick ``slide show'':
.RS
\f\*(pffbclear
.br
for \|i \|in \|*.pix
.br
do	fbfade \|-f $i
.br
	sleep \|15
.br
done
.br
fbfade\fP
.RE
.SH "SEE ALSO"
libfb(\*(ls), pix(\*(fs).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
