.SH NAME
fb\(hyrle \- save frame buffer image in a run-length encoded file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fb-rle
.RB [ \-cdh ]
.RB [ \-F\  framebuffer]
.RB [ \-C\  r/g/b]
.RB [ \-S\  squarescrsize]
.RB [ \-W\  scr_width]
.RB [ \-N\  scr_height]
.RB [ \-X\  scr_xoff]
.RB [ \-Y\  scr_yoff]
.RB [ \-s\  squarefilesize]
.RB [ \-w\  file_width]
.RB [ \-n\  file_height]
[file.rle]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fb-rle\^
saves an image from a frame buffer in the University of Utah
standard (Edition-3, or "Utah Raster Toolkit")
Run-Length Encoded (RLE) format file
(these files can be displayed with
.IR rle-fb\^ (1)
or a similar program).
If
.I file.rle\^
is not specified, standard output is written.
.PP
The size of the image to be saved can be set with the
.B \-s
or
.B \-n
and
.B \-w
command line options.  If these are omitted, the entire
screen area will be saved.
The image rectangle to be saved
can be repositioned on the screen with the
.B \-X
and
.B \-Y
command line options.
.TP
.B \-h
changes the screen size to 1024x1024.
.TP
.BI \-W\  scr_width
specifies the desired width of the screen, in pixels.
.TP
.BI \-N\  scr_height
specifies the desired height of the screen, in scanlines.
.TP
.BI \-S\  squarescrsize
sets the screen width and height to the indicated value.
.TP
.BI \-F\  framebuffer
This option specifies which framebuffer the image is to be saved from.
If not given, the environment variable
.SM \fBFB_FILE\fR
is used to select the display device (see
.IR brlcad(1) ).
If
.SM \fBFB_FILE\fR
has not been set, the default device for your system will
be used.
.TP
.BI \-w\  file_width
specifies the desired width of the saved image, in pixels.
.TP
.BI \-n\  file_height
specifies the desired height of the saved image, in scanlines.
.TP
.BI \-s\  squarefilesize
sets the saved image width and height to the indicated value.
.TP
.B \-c
The ``crunch colormap'' option.
If the frame buffer contains a non standard (i.e. non linear) colormap,
rather than saving that colormap in the RLE file
this option causes the colormap to be applied
to the pixel data before it is saved in the file.
This can be useful to preserve dramatic images created with wierd color maps
such that Gamma correction (eg, for film) can also be applied.
This option is recommended when producing images for export to other
display systems, so that variations in the interpretation of color maps
between different types of display hardware do
not affect the displayed image.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug option, provides a verbose description of the input file structure and
image decoding process, written on standard error.
.TP
.BI \-C\  r/g/b
The background value to be recorded in the RLE file is normally
automatically selected from the display.
This option permits
the user to specify an alternate background color
as a red/green/blue tripple, separated by slashes (``/'').
The color intensity in each channel ranges from 0 (dark) to 255 (bright).
.TP
.BI \-X\  scr_xoff
Specify a screen X offset, which will offset the saved area onto the screen
by the given amount.  (ie,
.BI \-X\  10
would place (0,10) on the screen in the RLE image rectangle coordinate (0,0).
.TP
.BI \-Y\  scr_yoff
Specify a screen Y offset, which will offset the saved area onto the screen
by the given amount.
.TP
.I file.rle\^
Name of file to be written, in RLE format.
If not specified, standard output is used instead.
.PP
The run length encoded image format is best used for the long-term
storage of images, as it uses less disk storage than a
.I pix(5)
file, at the expense of requiring more processing
for the encoding and decoding.
This program is also useful when using the Utah Raster Toolkit
utilities, which only operate on RLE encoded files.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.
