.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I Utah Raster Toolkit
is a collection of programs and C routines for
dealing with raster images commonly encountered in computer graphics.
A device and system independent image format stores images
and information about them.  Called the 
.IR RLE (5)
format, it uses
run length encoding to reduce storage space for most images.

The programs (tools) currently included in the toolkit are listed above,
together with a short description of each one.  Most of the tools read
one or more input RLE files and produce an output RLE file.  Some
generate RLE files from other information, and some read RLE files and
produce output of a different form.

An input file is almost always specified by mentioning its name on the
command line.  Some commands, usually those which take an indefinite
number of non-file arguments (e.g.,
.IR rleaddcom )
require a
.B \-i
flag to introduce the input file name.
If the input file name is absent the tool will usually
read from the standard input.  An input file name of "\-" also signals
that the input should be taken from the standard input.

On Unix
systems, there are two other specially treated file name forms.  A
file name starting with the character '|' will be passed to
.IR sh (1)
to run as a command.  The output from the command will be read by the
tool.  A file whose name ends in ".Z" (and which does not begin with
a '|') will be decompressed by the
.IR compress (1)
program.  Both of these options supply input to the tool through a
pipe.  Consequently, certain programs (those that must read their
input twice) cannot take advantage of these features.  This is noted
in the manual pages for the affected commands.

An output file is almost always specified using the option
.B \-o
.IR outfile .
If the option is missing, or if 
.I outfile
is "\-", then the output will be written to the standard output.

On Unix systems, the special file name forms above may also be used
for output files.  File names starting with '|' are taken as a command
to which the tool output will be sent.  If the file name ends in ".Z",
then
.I compress
will be used to produce a compressed output file.

Several images may be concatenated together into a single file, and
most of the tools will properly process all the images.  Those that
will not are noted in their respective man pages.

.B Picture comments.
Images stored in \fIRLE\fP form may have attached comments.  There are
some comments that are interpreted, created or manipulated by certain
of the tools.  In the list below, a word enclosed in <> is a
place-holder for a value.  The <> do not appear in the actual comment.
.TP
\fIimage_gamma=<float number>\fP
Images are sometimes computed with a particular ``gamma'' value --
that is, the pixel values in the image are related to the actual
intensity by a power law, \fIpixel_value=intensity^image_gamma\fP.
Some of the display programs, and the \fIbuildmap\fP(3) function will
look for this comment and automatically build a "compensation table"
to transform the pixel values back to true intensity values.
.TP
\fIdisplay_gamma=<float number>\fP
The \fIdisplay_gamma\fP is just \fI1/image_gamma\fP.  That is, it is
the ``gamma'' of the display for which the image was computed.  If an
\fIimage_gamma\fP comment is not present, but a \fIdisplay_gamma\fP
is, the displayed image will be gamma corrected as above.  The
\fIto8\fP program produces a \fIdisplay_gamma\fP comment.
.TP
\fIcolormap_length=<integer>\fP
The length of the colormap stored in the \fIRLE\fP header must be a
power of two.  However, the number of useful entries in the colormap
may be smaller than this.  This comment can be used to tell some
of the display programs (\fIgetx11\fP, in particular) how many of
the colormap entries are used.  The assumption is that entries 0 \-
\fIcolormap_length\-1\fP are used.  This comment is produced by
\fImcut\fP, \fIrlequant\fP, and \fIrledither\fP.
.TP
\fIimage_title=<string>\fP
This comment is used by \fIgetx11\fP to set the window title.  If
present, the comment is used instead of the file name.  (No other
programs currently pay attention to this comment.)  The comments
\fIIMAGE_TITLE\fP, \fItitle\fP, and \fITITLE\fP are also recognized,
in that order.  No programs produce this comment.
.TP
\fIHISTORY=<string>\fP
All toolkit programs (with the exception of rleaddcom) create or add
to a \fIHISTORY\fP comment.  Each tool appends a line to this comment
that contains its command line arguments and the time it was run.
Thus, the image contains a history of all the things that were done to
it.  No programs interpret this comment.
.TP
\fIexponential_data\fP
This comment should be present in a file stored in ``exponential''
form.  See \fIunexp\fP(1) and \fIfloat_to_exp\fP(3) for more
information.  The \fIunexp\fP program expects to see this comment.
