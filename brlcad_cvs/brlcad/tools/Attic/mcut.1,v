.SH NAME
mcut \- Quantize colors in an image using the median cut algorithm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mcut
[
.B \-n
.I colors
]
[
.B \-d
] [
.B \-o
.I outfile
]
.I infile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mcut
reads an RLE file and tries to choose the "best" subset of colors to
represent the colors present in the original image.  A common use for this
is to display a 24 bit image on a frame buffer with only eight bits per
pixel using a 24 bit color map.  
.I Mcut
first quantizes intensity values
from eight bits to five bits, and then chooses the colors from this space.

.I Mcut
runs in two passes; the first pass scans the image to find the color
distributions, and the second pass maps the original colors into color
map indices.  The output file has a color map containing the colors
\fImcut\fP has chosen.  \fIMcut\fP also sets the picture comment
"color_map_length" equal to the number of colors it has chosen.  The
.I getx11
program (among others) will use this color map instead of dithering.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-n " ncolors"
Limit the number of colors chosen to ncolors.  The default is 200.
.TP
.B \-d
Uses Floyd/Steinberg dither to hide contouring.  Greatly improves images
that have a small number of colors.
.TP
.I infile
The input will be read from this file.  If it is a multi-image file,
each image will be quantized to its own colormap.
Piped input is not allowed.  
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
If specified, output will be written to this file, otherwise it will
go to stdout.

.SH BUGS
The initial quantization is hardwired to five bits.  This should be an
option.
