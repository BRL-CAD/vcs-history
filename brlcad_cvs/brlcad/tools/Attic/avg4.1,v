.TH AVG4 1 "Nov 12, 1986" 1
.UC 4 
.SH NAME
avg4 \- Downfilter an image by simple averaging.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B avg4
[
.B \-o
.I outfile
] [ 
.I infile
] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR Avg4
downfilters an RLE image into a resulting image of 1/4th the size,
by simply averaging four pixel values in the input image to produce a single
pixel in the output.  If the original image does not contain an alpha
channel, avg4 creates one by counting the number of non-zero pixels in each
group of four input pixels and using the count to produce a coverage value. 
While the alpha channel produced this way is crude (only four levels of
coverage) it is enough to make a noticeable improvement in the edges of 
composited images.  
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I infile
The input will be read from this file, otherwise, input will
be taken from stdin.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
If specified, output will be written to this file, otherwise it will
go to stdout.

.SH AUTHOR
Rod Bogart, John W. Peterson
.SH BUGS
Very simple minded \- more elaborate filters could be implemented.
