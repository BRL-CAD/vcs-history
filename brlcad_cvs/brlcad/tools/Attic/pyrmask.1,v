.TH PYRMASK 1 "Nov 8, 1987" 1
.UC 4 
.SH NAME
pyrmask \- Blend two images together using Gaussian pyramids.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pyrmask 
[
.B \-l
.I levels
] [
.B \-o
.I outfile
]
.I "inmask outmask maskfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pyrmask
blends two images together by first breaking the images down into
separate bandpass images, combining these separate images, and then adding
the new bandpass images back into a single output image.  This can produce
very seamless blends of digital images.  The two images
are combined on the basis of a third "mask" image.  The resulting image
will contain the 
.I inmask
image where the mask contains a maximum value (255) and the 
.I outmask 
image where the mask contains zeros.  This is done on a channel by channel
basis, i.e. the maskfile should have data in each channel describing how
to combine each channel of the 
.I inmask
and
.I outmask
images.  All three images
must have exactly the same dimensions (both image size and number of channels).
For best results, it's often useful to filter the mask image a little with
.IR smush (1)
first.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-l " levels"
How many pyramid levels to use (maximum is log(2) of image size).
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
If specified, output will be written to this file, otherwise it will
go to stdout.

.SH BUGS
The current implementation has very
strict requirements for image sizes and dimensions.  The extensive
use of floating point computation makes it very slow for normal sized
images.  It also keeps all of the bandpass images in core at
once, which requires considerable amounts of memory.

Pyrmask is built on top of a library of functions for working with
Gaussian pyramids.  This library has yet to be documented or fully
tested.
