.SH NAME
rlequant \- variance based color quantization for RLE images
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program quantizes the colors in an RLE image using a
variance-based method.  See 
.IR colorquant (3)
for more details on the method.
.TP
.BI \-b " bits"
The colors in the input image will be "prequantized" to this many bits
before applying the variance-based method.  Two internal tables of
size 
.BR "2^(3*" bits ")"
are allocated, so values of
.I bits
greater than 6 are likely to cause thrashing or may prevent the
program from running at all.  The default value of
.I bits
is 5.  It must be less than or equal to 8 and greater than 0.
.TP
.B \-c
Only the color map will be output; the image will not be digitized.
The output file will be a 0x0 
.IR RLE
file with a color map, suitable for input to 
.IR rleldmap (1)
or
.IR rledither (1).
.TP
.B \-d
Floyd Steinberg dithering is performed on the output.  This is very helpful
for images being quantized to a small number of colors.
.TP
.B \-f
If this option is specified, a faster approximation will be used.  In
most cases, the error so introduced will be barely noticeable.
.TP
.B \-m
Computes a single color map suitable for quantizing all the input
images.  This is useful when the quantized images will be used as a
"movie" (e.g., with the 
.B \-m
flag of
.IR getx11 (1)).
The input may not come from a pipe when this option is specified,
unless
.B \-c
is also specified.
.TP
.BI \-n " colors"
The output image will be quantized to at most
.I colors
colors.  It might have fewer if the input image has only a few colors
itself.  The default value of
.I colors
is 256.  It must be less than or equal to 256.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
The output will be written to the file
.IR outfile .
If not specified, or if
.I outfile
is "\-", the output will be written to the standard output stream.
.TP
.I infile
This file contains one or more concatenated RLE images.  Each will be
processed in turn.  A separate quantization map will be constructed
for each image.  If not specified, or if
.I infile
is "\-", the image(s) will be read from the standard input stream.
