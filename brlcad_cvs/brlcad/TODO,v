@BRL-CAD To Do List
==================

Included below is a list of things that are scheduled or desirable to
be done at some point.  Most recently added items are on top, older
topics are on the bottom.  This is not an official list, it's more a
scratch pad for the developers to use for tracking development ideas
and informal plans.

The items listed for release should not ever hinder, stop, or
otherwise delay a release from being made.  The items listed are
merely to give an estimate of what was expected to be done.  See the
project task tracker for more to do items and future planning efforts.
http://sf.net/pm/?group_id=105292


THESE SHOULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE NEXT RELEASE
-------------------------------------------

* migrate to Subversion


THESE SHOULD HAPPEN WITHIN TWO RELEASE ITERATIONS
-------------------------------------------------

* fix query_ray

* fix rt parallel crash
  (true ; while [ $? -eq 0 ] ; do rt -o /dev/null moss.g all.g ; done)

* fix parallel crash report generation (multiple BU_MAPPED_FILE's
  getting acquired)

* convert non-critical bu_bomb instances to bu_exit

* fix incrTcl pathing issues when only using system tcl/tk
  (get incrTcl subconfigure to work like was done for Tcl)

* address the TODO items in src/mged/clone.c

* fix the "(type)(size_t)val" hacks (using ints like ptrs, etc)

* modify the new tree traversal code to be generic

* implement graphical crash reporter tool (bombardier)


THESE ARE LOWER PRIORITY OR FOR FUTURE RELEASES
-----------------------------------------------

* investigate rt_shootray/nirt backing out

* add high dynamic range image support to the framebuffers

* add alpha channel support to the framebuffers

* remote framebuffer timeout support (perhaps as ::key=val;key=val)

* make byteoffset and run-time byteorder detections necessary in order
  for Mac OS X universal binaries to actually work.

* review and integrate David Loman's bot-processing and object label
  scripts, add libdm interface for textual overlay support

* review librt polynomial root solver

* eliminate vararg.h and non-ansi cray-specific support code

* implement a lighting model for rt that visualizes how expensive each
  individual pixel is to compute with an intensity (heat graph)

* integrate 'the rest' of adrt, consider decoupling the dependencies

* integrate July 2007 openNURBS updates

* bezier extrusions need to be optimized, really should not be
  performing dynamic memory allocation in the root solver

* better/consistent argument processing supporting both long and short
  option names, perhaps using argtable

* decouple libdm from librt -- just one file in libdm uses librt,
  including a whole nasty primitive switch statement.  need to push
  that back over into librt.

* Implement an optical shader for the new "pixelated" military
  camouflage style

* preserve an arb8 as an arb8 (instead of writing as arb6 or arb5) and
  similarly for the other arb# sizes

* validate primitives during export so that it is guaranteed that
  illegal primitives will not be written to file

* implement a region annointment command where the user can turn an
  assembly into a region and change all lower or higher regions into
  combinations

* some means to obtain progress status during raytrace renderings

* enhance dxf-g to create more than just one combination per layer,
  creating multiple objects for the individual objects in the dxf file
  (instead of one conglomerate BoT)

* change root solver to have coefficients in the right order (!)

* use environ for run-time path lookups

* add an overlap depth reporting tolerance parameter to the
  ray-tracers (similar to -R).

* script that checks a dist source tarball for missing files

* Use NSIS instead of InstallShield/MSI for Windows binary releases

* Generate plain .zip files for Windows binary releases

* fix the variety of ami.tcl and ampi.tcl tclscript warnings/errors

* run indent.sh on directories (one at a time, validating results)

* set c-indentation-style to k&r to override default gnu style setting
  in Emacs. (see c-set-style)

* add support for arbitrary matrix transformations to torus primitive

* add configuration checks and build system support to disable C++
  outright if necessary, e.g. an --enable-c++ option

* configure support to enable/disable framebuffers, display
  managers, geometry converters, and image converters.  consider
  apache's module management as an example.

* libbu routine to make a temp file reliably/consistently

* review "eclectic" from GSI as a tessellation approach

* review and merge in the rest of the GSI modifications

* make target and/or script to update ChangeLog and version
  information, possibly including checking for consistency, to
  facilitate release process.

* add the automated rtarea spreadsheet-producing script to repository

* add some means to disable/minimize libfft on systems that don't have
  enough memory to compile the larger filters

* display the current mode in mged graphics window

* full/exact precision computation support

* c++ geometry engine/api using librt/libbn/libbu

* inside/outside point and voxel testing capability in librt

* automatic geometry voxelizer (perhaps using arbs or vol primitive)

* turn geometry converters and image converters into libraries

* add support for querying geometry properties to library including
  computing surface area and weight/mass.

* add verification and validation tests confirming behavior of the
  ray-tracer and computations of area, mass, volume, etc.

* testing suite for all binaries: for cmd2 in $(for cmd in `find . -name Makefile.am | xargs cat | perl -pi -e 's/\\\\\n//g'| grep -E "PROGRAMS ?=" | sed 's/.*=//g'` ; do echo $cmd ; done | sort | uniq ) ; do echo command: $cmd2 ; done

* add geometry example of building 238

* Mac OS X SGI dial knobs support

* merge old and 'new' tops behavior into one, preserving compatibility
  where it makes sense.

* ability to "unpush" objects, translating them to a new position and
  applying the correct matrix (using either bounding box or center of
  mass, for example)

* ensure successful build on mingw

* test for USE_FORKED_THREADS in configure

* optimize CSG structures automatically, automatic simplification.

* option to mged make command or new command that enters solid edit
  mode, "med", "smake", "makes", "msed", etc.  same for cp command.

* recursive configure and variable overrides for autogen.sh

* optimize configure testing so that when options are enabled, the
  corresponding library and functionality tests are not performed.

* have libbu report memory allocation statistics so the exact amount
  of memory requirements for a geometry database can be computed on
  the fly via a pre-prep phase.

* center of presented area

* short introductory documentation on using mged, covering a majority
  of the various commands.

* support to the raytracers for multiple image file formats,
  recognizing an option and/or the file suffix of the -o filename.

* libfb + font rendering (perhaps through libbn's plot interface) for
  a posix terminal.

* Optional compile-time support for using GMP or CLN for arbitrary
  precision arithmetic.

* gpgpu for enhanced performance boolweave sorting

* getexecname, "/proc/self/cmdline", program_invocation_short_name.
  separate out into new file.

* test out -Wfloat-equal

* geometry viewing commands/visualizations of exploded levels

* add command line help options to 'benchmark' tool

* mirror around an arbitrary plane (maybe point+vector) in mged

* mirror around point/distance along axis operation in mged

* librt-based path tracer

* system identifier application with sysctl-style information
  database, with some back-end functionality placed into libbu.

* write scripts that parse the sf.net tracker data and generate
  automatic reports for release.

* add callback data parameters to libpkg hook functions

* add performance options for the intel compiler on Altix

* investigate performance impact of using sched_setaffinity and/or
  pthread_attr_setaffinity_np for linux threading affinity in librt.

* rtedge-style tracer that outputs tool paths (splines/segments, etc)
  for CNC/CAM style toolpath cutting descriptions (g-code files).

* rt annotation support

* support for fillets and chamfers as object/combination operations

* make the DSP primitive use less memory when data is coming from
  a binunif. allocating 160 times binunif size is a bit extravagant
  (which comes from sizeof(struct dsp_bb)).

* add dynamic geometry support. i.e. the ability to modify the parsed
  in-memory geometry tree on the fly via api calls (e.g. to add holes)

* convert the documentation to docbook and integrate their generation
  with the build system.

* investigate why g-iges followed by iges-g on a single box results in
  permuted vertex lists

* fix reference to a "Create Solid" submenu on pdf page 18 (page 6) of
  volume II

* obliterate verbose compilation warnings

* add support for subgeometry support to the geometry syndicator

* add xml, nff, bzw, pov, blend geometry import and export support

* add support for filesystem-based geometry collections

* add support for levels of detail

* modify the raytracers to use common fb and file output code

* add missing manual pages (jra generated list on 04.2007):

ODDITIES
--------

* the scale structure in bn_cmd_noise_slice (bn_tcl.c) was never
  initialized. it looks like somebody has planned to extend the
  function but never carried out


THESE BREAK PROTOCOL OR ARE BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE
--------------------------------------------------

* support for features either as primitives or operations or both
  e.g. chamfer, fillet, round, etc

* fix the database I/O writing to properly support the addition of new
  primitive types.  this includes modifying the major/minor code or
  combinations/regions and binary objects

* add database support for constraints, expressions, parametric
  values, construction history, and timestamping.

* see doc/deprecation.txt for items that have been marked as
  deprecated or are available for deprecation.

@WOO HOO... tkCanvasBezier, the custom Tk extension that has complicated matters for getting into apt, portage, fink, and more is now no longer needed.  The sketch editor's bezier drawing code was rewritten to no longer use that canvas and instead just draw using ordinary Tk line segments, but evaluating the bezier curve directly just like the canvas was doing.  This was the last feature holding up release 7.10.2 so we're now on the green light for compilation and regression testing so that a release can be made.

@jason feels it's probably best to make mods to openNURBS itself now in order to fully integrate/complete the brep implementation and given his implementation uses libbu and libbn extensively, this move will make openNURBS similarly dependent.  thus, the intent is to then to effectively fork openNURBS and make it a noinst brl-cad sub-library (either in librt or up a level) for obtaining brep support.

@add support for arbitrary matrix transformations to torus primitive .. while there's certainly question on what this means to the mathematics of the implicit form (they're no longer mathematically a torus), the underlying modeling capacity is still needed and storing a transformation matrix or at least scaling vectors in the primitive (or above the primitive) would go a long way to handling this somewhat unique case.

@fairly comprehensive rewrite of tedit() for the ted command that merges the windows version in with the unix version in what should be a pretty platform independent manner.  this version tries a lot harder to find a usable editor other than /bin/ed including checking EDITOR even on Windows (there was some bug report for this, but can't find it atm).  it'll also kick off TextEdit on Mac OS X now as well as trying emacs and vi, before falling back on jove as the editor if it can find it.  still doesn't do run-time checking of the editor itself, but it should be more consistent.  also removed the closing of descriptors which lets console editors work and allows gui editors to be aborted
