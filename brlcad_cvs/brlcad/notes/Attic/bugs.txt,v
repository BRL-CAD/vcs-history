@---
Incorrect color values are raytraced for a region that has the emission specified (at least unexpected).  Resulted in pink objects.

---
Mged windows don't accept focus until second entry event is received on certain systems (Tk issue)

---
avg4 complains that an image output from pix-rle is not an rle.  does output the correct rle. 

---
mged is hard-wired to the libraries.  i.e. mged knows the hard path to the libraries it needs.  question: would it be possible to make the linking reletive (e.g. ../lib/libfb.so, etc)
