@<HEAD><TITLE>Animation Techniques in BRL-CAD</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1><A NAME="Introduction">Introduction</A></H1>
<P>
Moving pictures are created by presenting the viewer with a sequence of
still images in quick succession.
Objects which occur in an orderly succession of slightly different
locations within a sequence of images appear to be in motion to the viewer.
Such an object is said to be ``animated.''
Preparing a moving picture of animated objects
requires a large number of still images (often called ``frames'').
<P>
Still images of computer models 
are relatively easy to create within BRL-CAD.
<A HREF="foot_Deitz89.html"><IMG ALT="*|*" SRC="fn.gif"></A>
The program rt uses the technique of ray-tracing 
to create images of geometric models.
<A HREF="foot_Muuss88a.html"><IMG ALT="*|*" SRC="fn.gif"></A>
A moving picture or ``animation'' of the model can be created by using
rt to create a series of still images, each of which forms a frame of the
final moving picture.
The difficulty arises in specifying each frame for rt to create.
Some tools have been created to help make this process easier.
<P>

<P>
Before there can be motion there must first be form.
This means a description of geometry to be animated must exist.
To keep things simple, we will use the ``moss'' database distributed
with BRL-CAD.
Assuming that the distribution is stored in the directory
<B>/cadsrc</B> the following command will create a local copy of the database
for use with the examples presented here:
<PRE>
    % <B>asc2g < /cadsrc/db/moss.asc > moss.g</B>
</PRE>
Examples such as the one above are presented with
the portion typed by the user shown
in <B>bold</B> typeface.
