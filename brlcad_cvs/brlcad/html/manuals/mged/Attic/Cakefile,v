@Updated the Mged Command listing (html) to match the master list held in the (currently) MGED Users Guide (see pdf in doc/).  Since the two html files (mged_cmds.html & mged_devel_cmds.html) are no longer in sync, they are removed for the time being (so someone does not accidentally editthem (you know who you are\!)) until a more proper system is in place.  hopefully a docbook/xml-based solution..
