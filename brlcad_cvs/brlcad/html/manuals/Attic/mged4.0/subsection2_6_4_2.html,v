<P>
Some Megatek systems enter position data on the data tablet
using a pen-like stylus.
If the tip of the stylus is
within one-half inch of the surface of the tablet, a ``star'' corresponding
to this location is displayed on the display screen.  If the tip is moved
more than one-half inch from the surface, the position of the star remains
fixed.  When the stylus is pressed against the tablet surface, the pressure
switch is activated and a ``mouse'' event is sent MGED.
<P>
Other Megatek data tablets have a mouse instead of a pen.
This mouse has four buttons on it.
The yellow (top) button is used during illumination and editing just as the
pen on the Vector General terminals.
However, in the viewing mode, when pushed, the point which it was pointing
at will be drawn at the center of the screen.
The blue (bottom) button has this same function at ALL times and is used
to ``slew'' the display during editing.
The white (left) and the green (right) buttons on the mouse are used for
zooming the display at a fixed rate.
The white button will zoom out and the green button will zoom in.
