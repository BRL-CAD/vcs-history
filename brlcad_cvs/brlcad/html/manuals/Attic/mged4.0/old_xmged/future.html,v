@<title>XMGED - Future Work</title>
<h1>Future Work</h1>
These are a few of the items planned for the future.  It should be
noted that all of the XMGED features are still subject to change
based on user feedback and future design decisions.
<p>

<ul>
<li>Better help facility.  We are looking into a hypertext help facility.
<li>Provide a choice between using the Motif or Athena widget sets
<li>Read startup file that contains specifications for menus, key bindings,
  text colors, and the default views. These descriptions would be something
  like that found in a .mwmrc or .twmrc file.
<li> Command line editing for mged proper
<li> Display view axis
<li> Handle resize
</ul>
