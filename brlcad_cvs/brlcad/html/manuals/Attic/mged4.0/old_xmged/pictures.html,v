@<title>XMGED - Sample Displays</title>
<h1>Sample XMGED Displays</h1>
<i>click on each image for a larger display</i>

<p>
This picture shows the main display.  Buttons run down the left.
A command input window with scrolling, history, command line
editing, and aliases is at the bottom.  The drawing area in
this example in embedded into the interface above the command
window.  Menus appear along the top as appropriate for the
current state (e.g. solid and object edit menus).

This picture shows the multiview capability of XMGED.  By default three
ortho views and a 45,45 are shown.  The lower right window is
the main display (the one that will remain when multiviews is
exited).  Views can be swapped between windows.  During editing,
translations, rotations, and scales are active in all windows
simultaneously.

<p>
This picture shows an entire workstation screen.  Here the
option was selected of making the drawing area a separate window
from the command window.  Any number of such windows can be
opened.  This mode is normally used when
two workstations are available side by side.  For example,
it is common at ARL to dedicate an SGI display for drawing
and use a Sun or X Terminal for the user interface portion.
Sliders and edit parameter popup windows are also shown.
