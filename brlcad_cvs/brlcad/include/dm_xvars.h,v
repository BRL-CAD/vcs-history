@gah, pick up where someone left off over half a decade ago.  finish updating all of the compat4 symbols throughout the code to their new names.  finally. it's done.  make the deprecated headers obsolete -- make compat4.h obsolete too so we can be sure that all of the changes are now picked up by the compiler as errors.  this change will likely impact muves if they've similarly not updated to the new names too, so the headers are kept with a #warning for now (though will likely disappear down the road entirely).

@preliminary support for unaccelerated mgen on aqua through dm-tk

configure.ac:
        - use two levels of expansion for BRLCAD_DATA
        - enable_aqua configure option
        - move X11 ac_ macro tests from argument check section
        - rely on AC_PATH_XTRA to figure out most of what we need to know about
                where to find X
        - no longer look for libICE, libXmu, or libXsm  AC_PATH_XTRA
                populates X_PRE_LIBS with these but they seem completely unused
                right now.
        - look for opengl libs and headers in all of the places AC_PATH_XTRA
                looked for the xlibs
        - use tk's xlib headers when using tk-aqua rather than x
        - remove X11 "ugly hack"
        - include tk flags where necessary
        - remove --disable-shared from subconfigs
        - forcibly add tcl and tk build dirs to libtool wrapper scripts
libdm/Makefile.am, dm-tk.[ch], dm.h, dm-generic.c, dm_obj.c, mged/Makefile.am,
                attach.c, dm-generic.c, dm-tk.c, ged.c:
        - use lower case when referring to tk
        - add support for using dm-tk
        - include X_CFLAGS with DM_X
irprep/Makefile.am, util/Makefile.am:
        - disable build of ir-X, pl-X when there is no X
dm-X.c:
        - no need to test for HAVE_X11_XLIB here; if we don't have it we
                shouldn't be building this file
libfb/Makefile.am, if_tk.c, libfb/tcl.c:
        - build if_tk.c
        - add preliminary hooks so if_tk can be called when ready

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@ugh, what tedium.  put some effort towards cleaning up the doxygen labels and making the headers more consistent.  also exclusively using @@ for doxygen instead of \ to try to keep things more consistent.

@collapse the two structures into one, even though the structure really should NOT be serving double-duty and be compile-time variable-width..  doesn't allow multiple interfaces to be simultaneously compiled.  should absorb the interface into dm-X.h and friends at some point.
