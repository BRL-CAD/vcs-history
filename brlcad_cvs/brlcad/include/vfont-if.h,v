 *
 *  This header file describes the in-memory format used by
 *  the BRL-CAD Package routines for manipulating fonts stored
 *  in the Berkeley VFONT format.
 *  Note that the VFONT files are in the format found on a VAX --
 *  no conversion has been applied.
 *  Merely TARing or RCPing the VAX /usr/lib/vfont directory onto
 *  any machine suffices to install the fonts.
 *  The VAX format of the fonts is invisible to software actually
 *  using the fonts, except to be aware that bit zero in a byte of
 *  font data is on the right hand side (lsb).
 *
 *  The VAX declaration of the file is:
 *
 *	struct header {
 *		short		magic;
 *		unsigned short	size;
 *		short		maxx;
 *		short		maxy;
 *		short		xtend;
 *	};
 *	struct dispatch {
 *		unsigned short	addr;
 *		short		nbytes;
 *		char		up, down, left, right;
 *		short		width;
 *	};
 *	char	bits[header.size];
 *
 *  The char fields up, down, left, and right in the VAX-version
 *  of struct dispatch are signed.  Use the SXT macro to extend the sign.
 *
 *  The actual bits array has the upper left corner of the bitmap in
 *  the first byte.  Bits are scanned out of the bytes in a
 *  left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (most decidedly non-VAX style).
 *  Never seems to be any consistency in data formats.

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@ugh, what tedium.  put some effort towards cleaning up the doxygen labels and making the headers more consistent.  also exclusively using @@ for doxygen instead of \ to try to keep things more consistent.
