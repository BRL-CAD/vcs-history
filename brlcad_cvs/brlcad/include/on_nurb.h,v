@get rid of RCS variables from the public header files.  this is done in part to reduce recompilation during interface changes, but also to move towards not relying on or publishing the information contained in the variables interface-wise. (they're fine for c sources and private headers)

@Sweeping license updates.  Documentation is fully relicensed to the BSD Documentation License (a minor variant of the FreeBSD Documentation License and BSD License).  All GPL code (mostly application code) is converted to the LGPL and now also specifically declares version 2.1, revoking the blank check to the FSF.  The intent of these sweeping changes are to simplify the licensing terms and increase overall flexibility of use, both externally (to users for their purposes) and internally (to allow application code to be migrated to libraries without creating GPL libraries).  As a collective work, BRL-CAD is now LGPL.

@ugh, what tedium.  put some effort towards cleaning up the doxygen labels and making the headers more consistent.  also exclusively using @@ for doxygen instead of \ to try to keep things more consistent.

@Begin work on openNURBS-based primitive. OpenNURBS contains no intersection routines, so will be working off the Abert et al paper "Direct and Fast Ray Tracing of NURBS Surfaces" to implement intersection.
