Libpng 1.2.5 - October 3, 2002

This is a public release of libpng, intended for use in production codes.

Changes since the last public release (1.2.4):

  Revised makefile.cygwin to use DLL number 12 instead of 13.
  Added code to contrib/gregbook/readpng2.c to ignore unused chunks.
  Replaced toucan.png in contrib/gregbook (it has been corrupt since 1.0.11)
  Removed some stray *.o files from contrib/gregbook.
  Changed png_error() to png_warning() about "Too much data" in pngpread.c
    and about "Extra compressed data" in pngrutil.c.
  Prevent png_ptr->pass from exceeding 7 in png_push_finish_row().
  Updated makefile.hggcc
  Updated png.c and pnggccrd.c handling of return from png_mmx_support()
  Only issue png_warning() about "Too much data" in pngpread.c when avail_in
    is nonzero.
  Updated makefiles to install a separate libpng.so.3 with its own rpath.
  Revised makefiles to not remove previous minor versions of shared libraries.
  Revised 13 makefiles to remove "-lz" and "-L$(ZLIBLIB)", etc., from shared
    library loader directive.
  Revised libpng-config script.
  Relocated two misplaced PNGAPI lines in pngtest.c

Changes since the previous public release (1.0.1):

  Optimized Paeth calculations by replacing abs() function calls with intrinsics
  plus other loop optimizations. Improves avg decoding speed by about 20%.
  Commented out i386istic "align" compiler flags in makefile.lnx.
  Reduced the default warning level in some makefiles, to make them consistent.
  Removed references to IJG and JPEG in the ansi2knr.c copyright statement.
  Fixed a bug in png_do_strip_filler with XXRRGGBB => RRGGBB transformation.
  Added grayscale and 16-bit capability to png_do_read_filler().
  Fixed a bug in pngset.c, introduced in version 0.99c, that sets rowbytes
    too large when writing an image with bit_depth < 8 (Bob Dellaca).
  Corrected some bugs in the experimental weighted filtering heuristics.
  Moved a misplaced pngrutil code block that truncates tRNS if it has more
    than num_palette entries -- test was done before num_palette was defined.
  Fixed a png_convert_to_rfc1123() bug that converts day 31 to 0 (Steve Eddins).
  Changed compiler flags in makefile.wat for better optimization (Pawel Mrochen).
  Relocated png_do_gray_to_rgb() within png_do_read_transformations() (Greg).
  Relocated the png_composite macros from pngrtran.c to png.h (Greg).
  Added makefile.sco (contributed by Mike Hopkirk).
  Fixed a bug in pngrtran.c that would set channels=5 under some circumstances.
  Added warnings when people try to use transforms they've defined out.
  Collapsed 4 "i" and "c" loops into single "i" loops in pngrtran and pngwtran.
  Revised paragraph about png_set_expand() in libpng.txt and libpng.3 (Greg)
  Added max_pixel_depth=32 in pngrutil.c when using FILLER with palette images.
  Moved PNG_WRITE_WEIGHTED_FILTER_SUPPORTED and PNG_WRITE_FLUSH_SUPPORTED
    out of the PNG_WRITE_TRANSFORMS_NOT_SUPPORTED block of pngconf.h
  Added "PNG_NO_WRITE_TRANSFORMS" etc., as alternatives for *_NOT_SUPPORTED,
    for consistency, in pngconf.h
  Added individual "ifndef PNG_NO_CAPABILITY" for the capabilities in pngconf.h
    to make it easier to remove unwanted capabilities via the compile line
  Made some corrections to grammar (which, it's) in documentation (Greg).
  Corrected example.c, use of row_pointers in png_write_image().
  Revised png_read_rows() to avoid repeated if-testing for NULL (A Kleinert)
  More corrections to example.c, use of row_pointers in png_write_image()
    and png_read_rows().
  Added pngdll.mak and pngdef.pas to scripts directory, contributed by
    Bob Dellaca, to make a png32bd.dll with Borland C++ 4.5
  Fixed error in example.c with png_set_text: num_text is 3, not 2 (Guido V.)
  Changed several loops from count-down to count-up, for consistency.
  Revised libpng.txt and libpng.3 description of png_set_read|write_fn(), and
    added warnings when people try to set png_read_fn and png_write_fn in
    the same structure.
  Added a test such that png_do_gamma will be done when num_trans==0
    for truecolor images that have defined a background.  This corrects an
    error that was introduced in libpng-0.90 that can cause gamma processing
    to be skipped.
  Added tests in png.h to include "trans" and "trans_values" in structures
    when PNG_READ_BACKGROUND_SUPPORTED or PNG_READ_EXPAND_SUPPORTED is defined.
  Add png_free(png_ptr->time_buffer) in png_destroy_read_struct()
  Moved png_convert_to_rfc_1123() from pngwrite.c to png.c
  Added capability for user-provided malloc_fn() and free_fn() functions,
    and revised pngtest.c to demonstrate their use, replacing the
    PNGTEST_DEBUG_MEM feature.
  Added makefile.w32, for Microsoft C++ 4.0 and later (Tim Wegner).
  Fixed two bugs in makefile.bor
