BRL-CAD Contributors
====================

The BRL-CAD development team would like to take this opportunity to
thank the many people and organizations who have contributed to make
BRL-CAD the package that it is today.

BRL-CAD was originally conceived and written for the most part by the
late Michael John Muuss.  He is the original primary architect and
author.  The package has since been improved upon over the years by
Mike and the Advanced Computer Systems Team at the U.S. Army Research
Laboratory (* see note), as well as by many others around the world.
His work lives on in testament to his intellect and indomitable spirit
through the contributions and improvements by others.  We strive to
recognize those groups and individuals that have helped make BRL-CAD
the package that it is today here.

Contributions of this collective work are separated into major
sections depending on the level and type of involvement that the
individual maintained.  Contributors are roughly ordered
chronologically for each section, depending upon when involvement with
BRL-CAD began.  The earliest contributors are named first; likewise,
the most recent contributors are listed at the bottom.

Names are optionally followed by the organizations that may have
supported their involvement to some degree, also listed in
chronological order.  Developers are only categorized as such and are
only listed once as they tend to fit most categories, whereas the
contributions of others are categorized and repeated as appropriate.
Many individuals including many with affiliated organizations have
also supported the package of their own accord and on their own time.
Participation and contributions are graciously appreciated.

Active developers are denoted with an "**", meaning that they have
been actively involved within the past 12 months.

@include a unique/special/new section specfically for the folks that have worked on documentation.  this minimally includes betty schueler (mged tutorial vol2), eric edwards (VAST MAJORITY of the tutorial series vol1234), dwayne kregel (Principles of effective modeling vol3), and cliff yapp (docbook conversion efforts).  the developers are specifically *not* listed under the doc writer and other sections since they tend to apply to all of them, so make a note of that in the intro otherwise the list would be considerably longer and repetitious.

@Spencer, Thomas W.; McKie, Jim; Davies, Steve; Turkowski, Ken; Woods, James A.; Orost, Joseph; all added with special thanks for the (indirect) contributions to the package.   in particular, they all worked on the code 'compress.c' that serves as the basis for out libfb compression, added by chris johnson in 1991.  the code was derived from software contributed to Berkeley by James A. Woods, derived from original work by Spencer Thomas and Joseph Orost.  Spencer Thomas in particular is also listed in other places throughout the package for his work on the RLE code at the University of Utah.

@As reported directly from George Hartwig, Jr.:

"In the late 70's Dr Bruce Henriksen and Dr Stephen Wolff were trying to bring BRL into the world of multi-user computing and as a part of this process bought a PDP 11/70 computer, a variety of terminals and Mike Muuss to install a version of JHU Unix.  Early in this experiment Mike wrote a plotting package called Terminal Independent Graphics so that things could be plotted to terminals, primarily the HP2648A, and printers, again primarily Versatexs. This package was used as part of a chain of programs that were 'piped' together."

Basically, special thanks go to Dr. Wolff and Dr. Henriksen for enabling Mike to get started on BRL-CAD, providing resources and support presumably from a managerial level in the very very early days of BRL-CAD.
