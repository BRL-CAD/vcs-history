@	The Pro/Engineer to BRL-CAD conversion is a two step process.
First, in Pro/Engineer, you must select "Proe-brl" under the "File"
menu.  You will be prompted for an output file name, a starting region
ident number, a maximum allowed error for the facetization
approximation, and an angle control. The recomended value for the
angle control is 0.5.  After all prompts have been satisfied, the
currently displayed model will be output to a file in BRL-CAD ACSII
format (actually a Tcl script). The output file can then be converted
to BRL-CAD by using "asc2g" or by sourcing the file in MGED using the
"source" command.


	To inform Pro/Engineer about the Pro/Toolkit code that
produces ASCII file, you need to create a "protk.dat" file as
follows:

line 1:name proe-brl
line 2:startup spawn
line 3:exec_file 'full path to wherever you install the proe-brl executable'
line 4:text_dir 'full path to the "text" directory'
line 5:revision 2001
line 5:description Convert currently displayed model to BRL-CAD
line 7:end

	See "protk.dat" in this directory for an example. The
exec_file must inlcude the name of the executable file, and the
text_dir must include the name of the "text" directory. In the "text"
directory Pro/Engineer will look for a subdirectory named "usascii"
for a file named "usermsg.txt". The "text" directory in this directory
should be used or at least copied verbatim to where you want to use it.

	The "protk.dat" file must be located where Pro/Engineer will look for it.
Pro/Engineer will look in your current directory and in Pro/Engineer's "text"
directory (as well as a few other places).

	If the "protk.dat" file, the "proe-brl" executable, and the
"usermsg.txt" files are installed properly, you will see the message
"Installation of Proe-BRL converter succeeded" in the Pro/Engineer
message window when Pro/E starts.

First, in Pro/Engineer, you must select "Interface", then "Export",
then "BRL-CAD" under the part or assembly menu. The "current object"
will be output to a file in an ascii format.  The default file name will
be the name of the current object with a ".brl" suffix (note that the
Pro/Toolkit software makes the name of the current object all capital
letters). You may provide your own file name, and you may provide a
maximum chord height error for facetization and an angle control value
for additional improvement on small radii curves. It is recommended that
the angle control value be left at zero to avoid interferences between
curved surfaces (see the Pro/E "Interface Guide" for details about
these parameters. The second step is to use "proe-g" to convert the
".brl" file to a ".g" file (see "man proe-g").

	To inform Pro/Engineer about the Pro/Toolkit code that produces
the ".brl" file, you need to create a "protk.dat" file as follows:

line 1:name proe-brl
line 2:startup spawn
line 3:exec_file 'full path to wherever you install the proe-brl executable'
line 4:text_dir 'full path to the "text" directory'
line 5:revision 18
line 6:end

	See "protk.dat" in this directory for an example. The exec_file
must inlcude the name of the executable file, and the text_dir must
include the name of the "text" directory. In the "text" directory
Pro/Engineer will look for subdirectories named "menus" and "fullhelp"
and for a file named "usermsg.txt". The "text" directory in this
directory should be used or at least copied verbatim to where you want
to use it.

	If the "protk.dat" file and the "proe-brl" executable are installed
properly, you will see a message "BRL-CAD Export option added to Pro/E version
XX.X, build YYWW" in the Pro/Engineer message window.
