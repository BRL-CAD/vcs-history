@so far, only freebsd seems to use doubles for floats .. so revert the leniancy and report when implementations deviate from what should be expected from IEEE compliance.

@add BC_COMPLIANT_FLOAT and BC_COMPLIANT_DOUBLE for determining whether the floating point implementation seems to be IEEE 754 compliant.  a handful of tests are performed, namely checking that the epsilon tolerance matches the defined power, making sure 0 == -0, and that -0 is actually implemented.

@new m4/epsilon.m4 file.  define macros BC_TRY_RUN_OUTPUT, BC_FLOAT_EPSILON, and BC_DOUBLE_EPSILON.  BC_TRY_RUN_OUTPUT attempts to compile and run the provided program, saving the output in the provided variable.  this makes for really convenient tests that can output a calculated value (like computation tolerances).  The latter two respectively determine the floating point tolerance epsilon value (i.e. smallest value such that 1.0 + value != 1.0).  ANSI defines macros that should be provided, but they are sometimes not.
