@			    BRL-CAD
			 Release 7.10.4
		       http://brlcad.org/

BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform open source combinatorial
Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) solid modeling system that includes
an interactive 3D solid geometry editor, a network-distributed
symmetric multiprocessing high-performance ray-tracer,
network-distributed framebuffer support, image and signal-processing
tools, ray-tracing support for rendering and geometric analysis,
path-tracing and photon mapping support for realistic image synthesis,
animation capabilities, ray-tracing and numerical processing
libraries, a system performance analysis benchmark suite, an embedded
scripting interface, and a robust high-performance geometric
representation and analysis library.

BRL-CAD is the primary tri-service solid modeling CAD system used by
the U.S. military to model weapons systems for vulnerability and
lethality analyses.  The solid modeling system is frequently used in a
wide range of military and industrial application including in the
design and analysis of vehicles, mechanical parts, and architecture.
The package has also been used in radiation dose planning, medical
visualization, computer graphics education, CSG concepts and modeling
education, and system performance benchmark testing among other
purposes.

Actively developed since 1979, BRL-CAD is a collection of more than
400 tools, utilities, and applications comprising more than a million
lines of source code.  BRL-CAD supports a great variety of geometric
representations including an extensive set of traditional CSG
primitive implicit solids such as boxes, ellipsoids, cones, and tori,
as well as explicit solids made from closed collections of Uniform
B-Spline Surfaces, Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces,
n-Manifold Geometry (NMG), and purely faceted mesh geometry.  All
geometric objects may be combined using boolean set-theoretic CSG
operations including union, intersection, and difference.

BRL-CAD has been under active development for more than 20 years with
a portability heritage that includes systems such as a DEC VAX-11/780
running 4.3 BSD; DECStations running ULTRIX; Silicon Graphics 3030, 4D
"IRIS", O2, Onyx, and Origin systems running various versions of IRIX;
Sun Microsystems Sun-3 and Sun-4 Sparcs running SunOS; the Cray 1,
Cray X-MP, Cray Y-MP, and Cray 2 running UNICOS; DEC Alpha AXP running
OSF/1; Apple Macintosh II running A/UX; iPSC/860 Hypercube running
NX/2; the Alliant FX/8, FX/80, and FX/2800; Gould/Encore SEL PowerNode
6000/9000 and NP1; NeXT workstations; IBM RS/6000; HPPA 9000/700
running HPUX; Ardent/Stardent; Encore Multi-Max; and much much more.
BRL-CAD's extensive portability of course also includes a plethora of
common desktop and server versions of BSD, IRIX, Solaris, Mac OS X,
Linux, and Windows.

The BRL-CAD package is intentionally designed to be extensively
cross-platform and is actively developed on and maintained for many
common operating system environments including for BSD, IRIX, Linux,
Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows among others.  The entire package is
distributed in binary and source code form as free open source
software (FOSS), provided under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved
license terms.  BRL-CAD was released as open source in December 2004
with portions licensed under the GPL, LGPL, GFDL, and BSD licenses.
See the COPYING file for more details.

GETTING STARTED
----------------

This README file exists only to provide you a brief roadmap to the
contents of the BRL-CAD distribution.

The information on how to install and operate the software, to become
involved with the development of the package, or to run the benchmark
performance test suite have each become sufficiently large that their
details are covered in more detail in standalone documents.  For more
details on what BRL-CAD provides, see the documentation provided on
the website at http://brlcad.org/.

Information relevant to those interested in the source code is
contained in the HACKING and COPYING files.  See doc/benchmark.tr file
for benchmark suite information.  There is a variety of other
documentation and information also available in the doc/ directory.

Please note that this distribution package does not include the
various military-specific model analysis tools such as MUVES, GIFT,
SAR, SLAVE, VAST, etc., nor does it include any military geometry
databases.  If you desire to have access to this material, please
contact one of the BRL-CAD developers.


COMPILE AND INSTALL
-------------------

See the INSTALL file for details on configuring, compiling, and
installing BRL-CAD.  In order to compile and install BRL-CAD from a
source distribution, the following steps may be taken for a full
default install:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

If you do not have a configure script in your source tree (at the same
level as this README file), you will need a relatively up-to-date
version of the GNU Build System (autoconf, automake, & libtool)
installed.  The autogen.sh script will need to be run successfully in
order to generate the configure script first:

  sh autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

There are various options available to both configure and make.  Run
"./configure --help" for a list of available configuration options.
Users on multiprocessor systems will be able to speed up their builds
by passing the -j option to make (e.g. make -j4, assuming GNU make).

Once the build completes and assuming you have proper filesystem
permissions, you should be able to begin the installation by running
the "make install" .  By default, the package is configured to install
entirely into /usr/brlcad/.

You will need to add /usr/brlcad/bin to your path (or whatever was
used as a --prefix during configure) in order for the BRL-CAD binaries
to be in your path.


BENCHMARK
---------

After the build successfully completes, you will be able to verify
basic functionality by running the BRL-CAD Benchmark.  Running the
benchmark suite is integrated into the build system such that any time
after configure, you may run:

  make benchmark

If the build is successful, you will see "CORRECT" numbers and a
performance summary at the end.  The "vgr" line effectively shows you
approximately how much faster your machine is to a VAX 11/780.  After
installing BRL-CAD, you may run the 'benchmark' tool as well to run
the BRL-CAD Benchmark.

See the paper in doc/benchmark.tr for information on analyzing and
comparing the results of the benchmark tests in more detail.


COMMUNICATION
-------------

You are invited to participate in the InterNet (aka "ARPANET")
electronic mailing list on the BRL-CAD software.  There are various
BRL-CAD mailing lists available on the project website at
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=105292 including three
developer-oriented lists, a user list, and a read-only news
announcement list.  See the posted archives to get a feel for the
volume of list traffic for each list and to read/search past
discussions.

On-line web forums are likewise available on the project site at
http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=105292

A variety of information on BRL-CAD is available via the
World-Wide-Web.  Papers, documentation, and the software repository
may be found at:

  http://brlcad.org

In addition to the above, there is an official BRL-CAD IRC channel on
the Freenode network that may be reached by joining #brlcad on
irc.freenode.net connecting via port 6667.  For first-time users,
there is a web-based IRC client available for certain browsers at:

  http://irc.brlcad.org

IRC is the preferred method of communication to interact with the
BRL-CAD developers, to get involved with the project, obtain support,
or provide direct feedback.


BUG REPORTS AND FEATURE REQUESTS
--------------------------------

Please report any bugs encountered to the project bug tracker at
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=105292&atid=640802

Similarly, please post any request for feature enhancements or support
request to http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=105292&atid=640805
and http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=105292&atid=640803
respectively.

Survivability/Vulnerability Information Analysis Center (SURVIAC).

SURVICE provides their own BRL-CAD distribution that comes with
commercial support, documentation, and installation media.  Full
technical assistance is provided to their commercial distributions by
phone, FAX, postal mail, or e-mail.  Agencies of the Federal
Government may acquire the full service distribution with a MIPR or
OGA funds transfer.

For further details, contact:

BRL-CAD Distribution
SURVIAC Aberdeen Satellite Office
4695 Millennium Drive
Belcamp, MD 210017-1505  USA


BACKGROUND MATERIAL
-------------------

For overview information on the whole package, consult the website at
http://brlcad.org/ and the brlcad(1) manual page in the file
src/util/brlcad.1.  For a discussion of the significance of this
software, read the paper "Understanding the Preparation and Analysis
of Solid Models".


FUTURE EVENTS
-------------

It is expected that new releases of BRL-CAD will be issued
approximately once a month.  A new release is scheduled for
distribution at the beginning of every month, usually being posted
sometime within the first week of every month.

Depending on need, demand, and activity, additional releases may also
be made.  The additional releases will be heavily dependant upon the
level of user involvement and contributions in particular.
Information about new releases will be routinely provided by
electronic mail to recipients of this software as well as to the
BRL-CAD NEWS mailing list:

  http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=105292

Periodically, training and user group meetings are provided with
announcements similarly posted to the BRL-CAD NEWS mailing list.
Several BRL-CAD developers also regularly attend the ACM Siggraph
conference, the ACM Solid and Physical Modeling conference, and other
similar conferences, conventions, and symposiums as well.

	-- Who you are
	-- What the BRL-CAD package is to be used for
	-- The equipment and operating system(s) you plan on using
	-- That you agree to the conditions listed below.
a99 35
It is vital that your letter include a sentence acknowledging your
agreement to the conditions, such as "We agree to the
conditions of the distribution listed in your letter".
This software is an unpublished work that is not generally available to the
public, except through the terms of this limited distribution.
The United States Department of the Army grants a royalty-free,
nonexclusive, nontransferable license and right to use,
free of charge, with the following terms and conditions:
.sp
1.  The BRL-CAD package source files will not be disclosed to third
parties.  BRL needs to know who has what, and what it is being used for.
.sp
2.  BRL will be credited should the software be used in a product or written
about in any publication.  BRL will be referenced as the original
source in any advertisements.
.sp
3.  The software is provided "as is", without warranty by BRL.
In no event shall BRL be liable for any loss or for any indirect,
special, punitive, exemplary, incidental, or consequential damages
arising from use, possession, or performance of the software.
.sp
4.  When bugs or problems are found, you will make a reasonable effort
to report them back to BRL.
.sp
5.  Before using the software at additional sites, or for permission to
use this work as part of a commercial package, you agree to first obtain
authorization from BRL.
.sp
6. You will own full rights to any databases or images you create with this
package.
.sp
All requests from US citizens, or from US government agencies should be
sent to:
.sp
.nf

.fi
.sp
This distribution does NOT include the various BRL-specific model
analysis tools such as GIFT, SAR, SLAVE, VAST, etc.
.sp
For overview information on the whole package, consult the brlcad(1)
manual page, in the util/ directory, and the overview paper in
paper/overview. For a discussion of the significance of this software,
read the paper "Understanding the Preparation and Analysis of Solid
Models", included in the paper/ directory.
.sp
The first sections of this file discuss how to configure and compile
just enough software to run the benchmark.  After the benchmark results
are presented, information about configuring and installing the full
software package is presented.  If you encounter difficulty with
running the benchmark, you might wish to build the full package, to
take advantage of the image tools in tracking down your trouble.
.sp
.IP "BENCHMARK BACKGROUND"
.sp
This file describes how to set up enough of the CAD package to
run a benchmark test of the RT ray-tracing program on the sample
databases provided.  Each run will produce a 512x512x24 bit color
shaded image in a "bench/xxx.pix" file, and a run log in "bench/xxx.log".
Reference copies of the images are provided as "pix/xxx.pix" and
"pix/xxx.log".  The sample databases provided are processed in
order of increasing difficulty, and each produces a colorful image.  In
each picture there are two light sources; the primary source is located
near the center of the model (the white ball), and the secondary light
source is located at the "eye" position.
.sp
moss.g  --  This is a simple model, containing a yellow torus,
a green ellipsoid, a bluish cube, a pink truncated (distorted) cone,
all sitting on a blue plate.  Note the shadowing, and "specular splash".
.sp
world.g -- The same model as moss.g, but with various rendering
features enabled.  The model is enclosed in a hollow cloud sphere.
The plate is a mirror, the egg is crystal, the box has a debugging
texture map applied.
.sp
star.g  --  A familiar sight to Star Trek fans;  a low-detail exterior
of the ship "Enterprise".  The hull is white, with some other structures
in other colors.  The small red object in the foreground is the
shuttlecraft Galileo, to scale.
.sp
bldg391.g  --  An exploded view of a two-story imaginary computer site,
including various walls, red stairways, green disk drives, etc.
The lower floor is a mirror, the upper floor is glass.
.sp
The RT benchmark requires a binary database for input ("pix/xxx.g"), and
produces a binary image as output ("bench/xxx.pix"), along with a log
file ("bench/xxx.log").  To make this distribution machine independent,
both the databases and the reference copies of the images are provided
in an ASCII format in the "db" and "pix" directories, and
ascii-to-binary converters are provided.  If you are running this
benchmark on a non-UNIX machine that has difficulty writing binary
streams, change the "-o file.pix" flag to "-O file.a_pix" and RT
will write the ASCII form directly.  For more discussion, consult
the doc/pix.5 and conv/asc2pix.1 manual pages.
.sp
.IP "THE BENCHMARK."
.sp
These steps are involved in loading the software and running the benchmark
on a UNIX system:
.sp
.nf
1)  Load the distribution.
	mkdir cad
	cd cad
	tar x
(On System V, use ``tar xo'' instead, to forgo chown-ing away the files).
.sp
2)  Edit the various header files and Makefiles (see below for details).
	ed Makefile.defs
	ed h/machine.h                  # defaults OK for 32-bit systems
.sp
3)  Compile everything, and convert the databases and reference images.
	make benchmark
.sp
4)  Run the benchmark.  Make sure that the answers match the reference files
to within plus-or-minus one in each color (see pixdiff(1)).
	cd bench
	sh run                  # takes several VAX hours.
	cd ..
.fi
.sp
5)  Compare the execution times in the "bench/xxx.log" files with the
VAX-11/780 (with hardware FPA) times which are given in the
"pix/xxx.log" files.
.sp
.IP "BENCHMARK CONFIGURATION"
.sp
1)  Compilations in each directory involve four Makefiles, "Makefile"
which invokes \fImake\fR with three \fB-f\fR arguments,
"../Makefile.defs", "./Makefile.loc", and "../Makefile.rules".
This structure allows all configuration of this package to be
concentrated in Makefile.defs, with per-directory configuration
information in Makefile.loc files in each sub-directory, and
overall compilation and installation rules spelled out in Makefile.rules.
While this structure may seem overwhelming at first, it generally makes
the task of configuration very simple.
.sp
The first configuration step is to edit the "Makefile.defs" file in
the top directory of the distribution. As distributed, this file is
configured for a 4.n BSD Berkeley UNIX system on a VAX. In a future
version of the distribution, the main alternatives for this file will
all be provided; right now, a variety of things generally will need to
be tailored. Makefile.defs.xmp, Makefile.defs.gould, Makefile.defs.sun,
and Makefile.defs.sgi can be used as examples, but please do not just
use them without careful review.
.sp
Everything is clearly marked;  #SYSV# appears near symbols that need to
be changed to run on a System V UNIX. Certain vendor-specific settings
are similarly marked, e.g., #SGI#, #GOULD#, #ALLIANT#, #XMP#, #CRAY2#,
etc.
.sp
Select the correct value for SYSTEM.
.sp
At present, SYSVERS should be defined only when specifically called for,
presently on Silicon Graphics (SGI), Cray, and Sun machines.  The
complete list of current settings is in Makefile.defs. For the SGI, set
SYSVERS to either SGI34 for Release 3.4 and below, or SGI35 for Release
3.5 and above. If you do not have the TCP option on your SGI, don't
define either.
.sp
Configuration of libfb.  Full details on configuring the framebuffer
library are provided in the "Full Configuration" section, below. If you
just desire to run the benchmark but not display images, this library is
still necessary, as the debug and disk-file interfaces are always
provided.  In this case, the LIBFB_CFILES, LIBFB_OBJS, and LIBFB_CONFIG
lines should be null lists, ie:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	=
	LIBFB_OBJS	=
	LIBFB_CONFIG	=
.fi
.sp
In the case of extreme difficulty, a no-op stub version of libfb
is provided in rt/libfb-dummy.c.
.sp
The timer configuration LIBRT_TIMER must be specified, based on the
version of UNIX you are using. This timer module is for providing CPU
and elapsed time indications.  If your system has a vendor-specific clock
with more resolution than the normal UNIX library provides, you should
create your own system-specific timerXXX.c module. The line is
distributed as:
.sp
.nf
.ta 0.5i 2i 3i 4i 5i 6i
	LIBRT_TIMER	= timer42
.sp
For System V, select instead:
.sp
	LIBRT_TIMER	= timerunix
.sp
.ne 2i
The full range of choices are:
.TS
center box;
l l.
timer42	4.2 BSD, 4.3 BSD (Berkeley UNIX)
timerunix	Generic UNIX, System III, V, etc.
timer52brl	For BRL's System 5-under-4.n BSD
timerhep	Denelcor HEP
timercray	Cray X-MP running UNICOS (UNIX)
timercos	Cray X-MP running COS
.TE
.fi
.sp
2)  The file "h/machine.h" has a number of configuration
options, including the setting of:
.sp
.TS
center box;
l l.
fastf_t	fastest "C" floating point type (\fBfloat\fR or \fBdouble\fR)
LOCAL	\fBstatic\fR or \fBauto\fR, for fastest local data type.
FAST	LOCAL or register, for FAST fastf_t variables.
PARALLEL	Defined for parallel processors.
.TE
.sp
VAX, GOULD, Cray, Alliant and HEP examples are provided. The defaults
should be correct for reasonable 32-bit serial computers.  Note that
K&R ``C'' specifies that all floating point calculations must be done
as \fBdouble\fR, so it is usually fastest to set fastf_t to
\fBdouble\fR. Also note that when fastf_t is \fBfloat\fR in 32-bit IEEE
or IBM style floating point, not enough accuracy is carried to correctly
process large models. See the "Silicon Graphics Warnings" section for
more information.
.sp
3)  It is important to run "make depend" in the top directory of the
distribution each time these Makefiles are changed.  For libfb, mged,
and librt, it is also necessary to run "make clean" in those directories
after making related changes to the Makefiles, because the binaries
of some modules depend on configuration options selected in the Makefiles.
Failure to do this is the single most common cause of difficulty
when experimenting with the configuration of this software.
.sp
.IP "BENCHMARK RESULTS"
.sp
In the tradition of Dongarra, the Rays/sec figure is considered the
"RT Figure of Merit" (RTFM).  Note that the RTFM can only be compared
between different runs on the \fIsame\fR database;  it is not meaningful
to compare RTFM numbers between different databases. The Rays/sec number
for a multi-processor machine is for "aggregate CPU cluster seconds",
rather than rays/total CPU seconds (which remains fairly constant on
good parallel machines). Worthy finalists to date are listed below.
Entries are omitted for tests in which correct results were not
obtained.

It would be greatly appreciated if you would return to BRL any
statistics that you gather, including:  which BRL CAD release
was used, the manufacturer of the machine,
hardware and software version numbers, presence or absence of floating
point hardware, and the name (preferably InterNet or UUCP) of the
specific machine used.
.sp
.IP "FURTHER OPTIMIZATIONS"
.sp
After initial testing, you may wish to go back and enable the special
assembler version of sqrt(), by uncommenting and editing the FAST_SQRT
line in "librt/Makefile.loc".  4.2BSD VAX and Gould UTX 1.2 versions
are provided.  Note that the 4.3BSD VAX library sqrt() is even faster
than this one by more than 40%.
.sp
The file "h/vmath.h" has macros for numerous common vector operations;
if your system has hardware support for vector operations, after getting
the program working you would profit greatly from changing these macros
to machine-specific code.  The most important macros are MAT4X3VEC and
MAT4X3PNT.
See also "rt/machine.c".
If you do this, please submit the "rays/sec" figures for the
original as well as the optimized runs.
.sp
BRL is currently attempting explicit vector extensions to the C language,
as well as working with compilers that detect implicit vectorization.
This work will be included in a subsequent release.
.sp
.IP "SILICON GRAPHICS WARNINGS"
.sp
If you are attempting to run the benchmark on an SGI IRIS, beware of the
\fBlong float\fR -vs- \fBdouble\fR controversy.  The SGI C compiler
converts both \fBfloat\fR and \fBdouble\fR to 32-bit single-precision
numbers. While the current release of librt is believed to generally
operate correctly in spite of this, beware of the RT program failing to
find roots, or being unable to perform a "box push". Unfortunately, the
"star.pix" RT benchmark will will fail due to lack of floating point
precision, and generate lots of diagnostics, filling your disk.
.sp
SGI software release version 3.3.1, 3.4, and 3.5 have a defective
library version of hypot();  be aware of the (slower) substitute in
"rt/machine.c".
.sp
Operations of the form "*fp += incr;" are known to compile incorrectly
on release 3.5 when "fp" is declared as "\fBregister double\fR *fp"
(or \fBregister float\fR).  The one known instance of this in
util/bwmod.c has been "fixed" with a #\fBifdef\fR sgi.
.sp
When running MGED on a 3.5 Iris with XNS networking, there is no
select() capability, so non-blocking I/O has to be used instead.
This has two undesirable side effects.  First, it puts MGED into
a hard loop polling the workstation keyboard.  Second, it seems to
have an interaction with control-S/control-Q flow control -- if you
suspend output, most of it will be discarded.  However, MGED is
still usable in this configuraition.
.sp
Currently there are no good solutions to these problems.  Voice your
opinions to the vendor.
.sp
It is very useful to add a "gclear" account to each SGI, so that after
using the screen in 24-bit mode you can regain control of the screen by
typing "gclear", whether or not you are logged in.  Add this line
to /etc/passwd:
.sp
gclear::4:5::/tmp:/usr/bin/gclear
.sp
.IP "CRAY XMP WARNING"
.sp
If you are running the benchmark on a Cray XMP, as I'm sure all of you
are, the world.pix and bldg391.pix images will have a single byte in the
blue channel off by 1, out in the cloud background.  This is not to be
considered an error.
.sp
.IP "FULL INSTALLATION"
.sp
The steps involved in installing the full BRL CAD package
on a UNIX system are these:
.sp
.nf
.ta 0.5i 2i 3i 4i 5i 6i
1)  Load the distribution.
	mkdir cad
	cd cad
	tar x
(On System V, use ``tar xo'' instead, to forgo chown-ing away the files).
.sp
2)  Edit the various header files and Makefiles (see below).
	ed Makefile.defs
	ed h/machine.h	                  # defaults OK for 32-bit systems

.IP "FULL CONFIGURATION"
.sp
The following assumes that you have already loaded the distribution per
step 1 of "The Benchmark" section, and performed the configuration
outlined in the "Benchmark Configuration" section, above.
.sp
Note that if you are configuring the software for more than one type of
computer, you will have to go through this configuration procedure
separately for each system.  Configuration questions apply only to
the hardware available on the particular system presently being
configured. If you have several types of machine sharing a single
filesystem using NFS, be certain to have a separate CAD tree for each
machine, to keep the binaries separate.
.sp
You may wish to install the package in directories other than where BRL
does. In general, all CAD executable programs are installed in BINDIR
(/usr/brl/bin), with libraries going in LIBDIR (/usr/brl/lib). Users are
told to find the CAD-related include files in INCLUDE_DIR
(/usr/include/brlcad). Be certain to examine these defines in
Makefile.defs. The remote-frame-buffer daemon is installed in
/usr/brl/etc, see rfbd/Makefile.loc.  If you wish to use the BRL
directories, you may need to run (as root):
.br
.nf
 	mkdir /usr/include/brlcad
 	mkdir /usr/brl 
	mkdir /usr/brl/bin
 	mkdir /usr/brl/lib
 	mkdir /usr/brl/etc
.fi
.br
and then use chown(1) and chmod(1) to suit.
.sp
The configuration for libfb must be edited to reflect the display
hardware that you have.  Even if your system has no display hardware,
this library is necessary, as the debug and disk-file interfaces are
always useful.  (Lacking any displays at all, you may be able to utilize
the bw-impress(1) program to produce pictures on an Imagen
laser-printer).

.sp
In the case of no display hardware at all, the
LIBFB_CFILES, LIBFB_OBJS, and LIBFB_CONFIG lines should be null lists,
ie:
.sp
.ta 0.5i 2i 3i 4i 5i 6i
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	=
	LIBFB_OBJS	=
	LIBFB_CONFIG	=
.fi
.sp
If this is a SUN system of release 3.2 or higher, the display is
configured by:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	= if_remote.c if_sun.c
	LIBFB_OBJS	= if_remote.o ../libpkg/pkg.o if_sun.o
	LIBFB_CONFIG	= -DIF_REMOTE -DIF_SUN
.fi
.sp
If this is an SGI system of release 3.5, the display is configured by:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	= if_sgi.c
	LIBFB_OBJS	= if_sgi.o
	LIBFB_CONFIG	= -DIF_SGI
.fi
.sp
If this is an SGI system of release 3.4 or earlier with Excelan TCP
support, the display can be supported by:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	= if_sgi.c
	LIBFB_OBJS	= if_sgi.o sgiselect.o
	LIBFB_CONFIG	= -DIF_SGI
.fi
.sp
When using the framebuffer library on the SGI, it is necessary to modify
certain kernel limits in the binary image of your kernel to be able to
use a large block of shared memory.  Follow the directions in
libfb/if_sgi.c, and then reboot your workstation to allow the changes to
take effect.  There are claims that on some SGI machines, this may
cause unreliable operation, so be certain to keep a backup kernel.
.sp
If this is a TCP-capable system, you will want to include the remote
frame-buffer capability;  the defaults already provide for this. If you
are using a system which does not have TCP capability, you must edit the
top-level Makefile and remove the "needed for IF_REMOTE" line in the
"benchmark" rule, to prevent compiling "libpkg", in addition to
configuring in Makefile.defs.  For no remote capability, be certain
that IF_REMOTE \fIet. al.\fR are not defined in the LIBFB_CONFIG lines.
Build a remote-framebuffer-only library with:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	= if_remote.c
	LIBFB_OBJS	= if_remote.o ../libpkg/pkg.o
	LIBFB_CONFIG	= -DIF_REMOTE
.fi
.sp
To offer in-bound remote framebuffer service, you may wish to compile
"rfbd", the remote-framebuffer daemon. If you wish to do this, you must
also add the IF_REMOTE capability to libfb. If your system does not support
inetd(8), then rfbd should be started in /etc/rc.local. However, if your
system does support inetd(8), then rfbd must be started with this
/etc/inetd.conf entry:
.sp
.nf
remotefb stream tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/brl/etc/rfbd       rfbd
.sp
This depends on having a ``nobody'' user, so be certain that your
/etc/passwd file contains a line like this.  (The choice of UID and
GID of -2 is intentional).
.sp
nobody:*:-2:-2:NFS Unprivileged user:/nonexistent:/dev/null
.sp
Also, be certain to add this line to /etc/services:
.sp
remotefb        5558/tcp                        # Remote Frame Buffer
.fi
.sp
Note that systems with multiple display devices, or for systems that
have a display and also wish to use the remote capability, multiple
entries should be made.  For example, on
a TCP-capable SGI system of release 3.5, the typical configuration is:
.sp
.nf
	LIBFB_CFILES	= if_sgi.c if_remote.c
	LIBFB_OBJS	= if_sgi.o if_remote.o ../libpkg/pkg.o
	LIBFB_CONFIG	= -DIF_SGI -DIF_REMOTE
.fi
.sp
As distributed, the remote, Adage, and Pseudo-tty (Teletype DMD 5620)
interfaces are all enabled.  You will almost certainly wish to change
this;  failure to do so is the second most common source of difficulties in
installing this distribution. If you change the configuration of libfb
partway through building the system, be certain to run "cd libfb; make
clean; make depend" before recompiling other programs, because the
Makefiles and binaries change based on the configuration options in
Makefile.defs.
.sp
The file h/rle.h has a #\fBif\fR statement that will need modification if
your machine is a "Little-Endian" machine and your machine is not
a VAX.  "Big-Endian" machines will work without modification.
A Big-Endian machine has byte [0] on the left of the word, like IBM,
while a Little-Endian machine has byte [0] on the right side of the word,
like DEC.  Some of the RLE code needs to know.
.sp
The MGED (multi-device model editor) needs to be configured.
At present, all versions of MGED have support for these types of
display devices by default:
.TS
center box;
l l.
plot	any UNIX-plot filter
tek	Tektronix 4014 and family
tek4109	Tektronix 4109
.TE
These optional display devices are also supported,
when specifically configured:
.TS
center box;
l l.
ir	SGI IRIS 2400, 3030
sun	SUN 3.2 Pixwin
vg	Vector General 3300

rat80	Raster Tech One/80
ps	E&S Picture System 300
mer	Megatek Merlin 9200 [Marginal]
sab	Saber w/GOPS [Marginal]
.TE
Necessary vendor-supplied libraries must be listed on the MGED_LIBES line.
.sp
To configure just the default set of displays, specify:
.sp
.nf
.ta 0.5i 2i 3i 4i 5i 6i
	MGED_CFILES	=
	MGED_OBJS	=
	MGED_CONFIG	=
	MGED_LIBES	=
.sp
To configure an SGI Iris ("ir") running 3.5 with TCP networking, specify:
.sp
	MGED_CFILES	= dm-ir.c
	MGED_OBJS	= dm-ir.o
	MGED_CONFIG	= -DDM_IR
	MGED_LIBES	= -lbsd -lgl2
.sp
To configure an SGI Iris ("ir") running 3.5 with XNS networking, specify:
.sp
	MGED_CFILES	= dm-ir.c
	MGED_OBJS	= dm-ir.o
	MGED_CONFIG	= -DDM_IR -DNONBLOCK
	MGED_LIBES	= -lbsd -lgl2
.sp
To configure an SGI Iris ("ir") running 3.4, specify:
.sp
	MGED_CFILES	= dm-ir.c
	MGED_OBJS	= dm-ir.o
	MGED_CONFIG	= -DDM_IR
	MGED_LIBES	= ../libfb/sgiselect.o -lgl2
.sp
To configure a SUN, specify:
.sp
	MGED_CFILES	= dm-sunpw.c
	MGED_OBJS	= dm-sunpw.o
	MGED_CONFIG	= -DDM_SUNPW
	MGED_LIBES	= -lsuntool -lsunwindow -lpixrect
.fi
and remember always to run MGED under a gfxtool window.
Also note that SUN support is still rudamentary, and there are problems
with (a) running RT from within MGED, and (b) using MGED on a color SUN.
.sp
In all cases,
be certain to properly define the MGED_VERS variable.
.sp
If this is a machine without TCP network capability, you will also have
to edit the top level Makefile to remove rfbd and libpkg from the
PRODUCTS list.
.sp
.IP "KNOWN PROBLEMS"
.sp
The Whetstone benchmark is written in FORTRAN, with a subroutine
in C for determining timings.  The linkage between the two languages
is very system dependent, and you are likely to have to fiddle with
the C code to obtain correct operation.  It was felt that the benefit
of having this well known benchmark on the tape was worth braving
the non-portability for.
.sp
.IP "NON-PROBLEMS"
.sp
There are several portions of the "make all" sequence that generate
messages that might appear to be errors, but are actually intentional.
It is regretable that we are not yet able to suppress these.
Any instances of the message "**** Error code 1 (ignored)" are not
actual errors, but are by-products of the Makefile using the
test(1) command to configure itself.
Another non-error message is:
.nf
---------- h
make  -  -f ../Makefile.defs -f Makefile.loc -f ../Makefile.rules depend
make -k -  -f ../Makefile.defs -f Makefile.loc -f ../Makefile.rules
Too many command lines for `noprod'
echo "No clobbering the header files"
No clobbering the header files
.fi
.sp
On the Silicon Graphics, when building libfb, these three messages are
harmless:
.nf
ranlib: warning: libfb.a(oldbbox.o): no symbol table
ranlib: warning: libfb.a(oldfont.o): no symbol table
ranlib: warning: libfb.a(stopwatch.o): no symbol table
.fi
.sp
When running a "make install", the db and pix directories will report
``Make:  Don't know how to make install.  Stop.'', which is OK.
Also, error messages of the form
``cp: *.1.stub: No such file or directory'' and
``cp: *.doc: No such file or directory'' and the like are
also OK.  The Makefiles are complicated enough as it is.
.sp
.IP "IMAGE DISPLAY"
.sp
If you have a suitable framebuffer, you will probably wish to
display the images generated by the benchmark, and compare them
to the reference images.  A pix(5) file is a sequence of \fBunsigned char\fR
triples written RGB in the range 0 to 255.  The first pixel goes in
the lower left corner of the screen, and subsequent pixels write to the
right; subsequent scan lines are displayed above earlier ones.  (First
quadrant display).  See doc/pix.5 for more details.
.sp
Programs for dealing with images are in the "util" directory. To display
a pix(5) file on a framebuffer, set environment variable FB_FILE
(see brlcad(1) for details), and run pix-fb.  Note that by leaving
FB_FILE unset, your default display will be used.
.sp
.nf
	cd bench
	pix-fb moss.pix
.fi
.sp
If the images computed on your machine do not match the reference images,
the program "util/pixdiff" will compute a pix file that will highlight
the differences for you, and report a summary of bytes equal, off-by-1,
and off-by-many, e.g.,
.sp
.nf
	pixdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \(or pix-fb
.fi
.sp
For a display of the relative magnitude of the differences at
each pixel, use "util/bwdiff" instead, e.g.,
.sp
.nf
	bwdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \(or pix-fb
or
	bwdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \(or \\
	bwmod -s 128 -m 4 -a 128 \(or pix-fb
.fi
.sp
and for statistics on the differences, use
.sp
.nf
	bwdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \(or pixstat
.fi
.sp
.IP "ENHANCEMENTS"
.sp
It is expected that new releases of this software will be issued roughly
semi-annually. Information about new releases will be routinely provided
to recipients of this software.  If your address changes, please let us
know, so we can update our records.
.sp
If you develop additional software for the BRL CAD environment that
you would be willing to share, please send it to us for inclusion
in the next release.
The first such inclusion is the Utah Raster Toolkit, included "as is"
in the directory utah-raster.  Note that the current BRL CAD
distribution uses Edition-2 of the Utah RLE file format, while the
Utah Raster Toolkit uses Edition-3.  In a subsequent release, all
the BRL CAD tools will have been converted to use the Edition-3
format and library interface.  Image conversion aids exist in the
programs utah-raster/get/getfb.c to display Edition-3 RLE images
on libfb supported displays, and utah-raster/tools/jwp/pixtorle.c
to convert pix(5) images into Edition-3 RLE images.
Note that BRL considers the RLE format a long-term image storage format,
with pix(5) format used for image manipulation, while Utah uses RLE
format for all manipulation stages as well.
.sp
.IP "ADDING SUPPORT FOR NEW DISPLAYS"
.sp
If you desire to add support for a new display, there are only two
modules that you will have to create.  The first will be for the
framebuffer library (see libfb(3) for more details).  A template for
creating interfaces to new devices is provided as libfb/if_TEMPLATE.c.
The second module needed is an MGED display manager, like mged/dm-XX.c.
Here, the task is somewhat harder, as two major modes of behavior are
supported:  displaylist and refresh.  You should examine display
managers for devices similar to yours, and proceed from there.
We would be most interested in obtaining any additional display modules
that you might develop.
.sp
.IP "UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 1.20 to 2.0"
.sp
This release contains only minor external changes from Release 1.20,
but for complete safety, you should save the old binary to "conv/g2asc"
someplace safe, so that if you find the binary format of the database
incompatable you can convert your old databases from binary to ASCII
form. Having to do this is system dependent (only Sun, SGI, and Alliant
users are likely to be affected), but it difficult to recover from
without having saved the old converter (or your old distribution tape).
.sp
.IP "UPGRADING FROM RELEASE 2.0"
.sp
Primarily, this release is a maintenance release, with lots of little
nits resolved, along with a few new features.  The major weak area is
still Sun display support.  In particular, using RT from within MGED
fails miserably.
.sp
This release contains different and better support for multiple lights
in RT, along with a standardized shader interface, and stackable
shaders. Support for polygonal objects is now correct, but slow. The
spline code has been significantly improved. Some contributed code for
the Raster Technologies One/80 has been included, but is untested.  The
library for procedurally generating databases ``libwdb'' is now
included, along with some example uses in the directory ``proc-db''.
The program ``rtwalk'' generates a viewpoint animation control script
that takes the eye between given start and end points, without walking
through any geometry.  This is especially interesting when used on
complex scenes like those made by proc-db/clutter.c.
.sp
.IP "WORK IN PROGRESS"
.sp
We are hard at work on a variety of new features, the most significant are:
(*) a substantial package for animation specification and preview,
(*) code to replace the "big-E" command, to convert the CSG model into
a polygonal approximation, for certain analysis codes, and to drive
display hardware with fast polygon rendering,
(*) additional primitive types,
(*) MGED improvements, including merging common database-handling code
with librt, and a consolidation of the MGED and LIBRT geometry modules.

Also note that when \fBfloat\fR is 32-bit IEEE or IBM style floating
point, not enough accuracy is carried to correctly process large models.

For non-US sites, an extra step is required.  You must send your letter
and tape to your Ambassador to the United States in Washington DC, and
have them forwarded to BRL through official channels.  Our current
understanding is that any requests from Foreign governments should be
sent on a Government to Government basis. The non-US Embassy should
forward requests to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence,
Department of the Army.  They handle all requests from foreign
governments, and they decide where it goes from there.  The address
to use is claimed to be:

.nf
1)  Load the distribution.
	mkdir cad
	cd cad
	tar x
(On System V, use ``tar xo'' instead, to forgo chown-ing away the files).
.sp
2)  Edit the various header files and Makefiles.
	ed Makefile.defs
	ed h/machine.h                  # defaults OK for 32-bit systems
.sp
3)  Compile everything, and convert the databases and reference images.
	make benchmark
.sp
4)  Run the benchmark.  Make sure that the answers match the reference files
to within plus-or-minus one in each color (see pixdiff(1)).
	cd bench
	sh run                  # takes several VAX hours.
	cd ..

In SGI release 3.5, printf() is unable to print the numbers 500.0,
1500.0, 2500.0, etc., when using the hardware floating-point chip
(eg, -Zf compiler flag) due to a bug in the hardware divide causing
troubles in modf().  This will cause 500.0 to print as ``4:0.0''.  This
problem goes away if you remove the -Zf flag when compiling, but then
your speed vanishes as well. A special hack exists in conv/Makefile.loc
if you have problems converting databases, but the trouble runs deeper
than that.

Note that the viewpoint specification information generated by the MGED

the specification of full articulation of the models for animation
purposes.  Also note that the specification and implementation of light
sources is being changed to allow multiple light sources of arbitrary
color and intensity.  If these changes will seriously impact your
work, contact the authors for updated modules.
