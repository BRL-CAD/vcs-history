@This is awf, the Amazingly Workable Formatter -- a "nroff -man" or
(subset) "nroff -ms" clone written entirely in (old) awk.

It is slow and has many restrictions, but does a decent job on most
manual pages and simple -ms documents, and isn't subject to AT&T's
brain-damaged licensing that denies many System V users any text
formatter at all.  It is also a text formatter that is simple enough
to be tinkered with, for people who want to experiment.

Type "make r" to run a regression test, formatting the manual page
(awf.1) and comparing it to a preformatted copy (awf.1.out).  Type
"make install" to install it.  Pathnames may need changing.

I don't know whether awf will run on 16-bit machines.  Data requirements
are modest, but I fear the programs are probably big enough to run awk
out of space.

I can't believe I really wrote this.
