Nevermind the LoadMacros hack - just prevent the re2c/lemon macro definitions from being overwritten if they're already defined using Alexander Neundorf's tip from http://www.cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2008-February/019776.html.  BRL-CAD defines 'em first, so the src/other copies won't get loaded (makes sure older versions of macro files that might linger in src/other don't stomp misc/CMake versions) but stand-alone builds will use the local copies.  Properly set up search ordering with CMAKE_MODULE_PATH should take care of this for the find_package commands, but the utility macros are separate and so must be handled differently.
