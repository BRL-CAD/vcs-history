Added dm_genDLists to struct dm. Changed dm_drawDList to return void. Set sp->s_dlist with a call to DM_GEN_DLISTS and use directly in openGL calls (i.e. no longer adding an offset). Also updated MGED's use of display lists (i.e. things are now being colored correctly. Also display lists were not always getting built).
END
