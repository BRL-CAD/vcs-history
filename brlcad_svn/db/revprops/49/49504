include a recent translation of the about page by Karen Mgebrova of armenia.  the armenian (hy) translation is a solid utf-8 monolith, but google translate confirms that it seems to be a good translation.  thanks karen!  credit her in NEWS and AUTHORS accordingly.  originally tried to name the file մասին.xml and everything worked fine in our toolchain except for the pre-commit hook on the sf.net side of the fence.
