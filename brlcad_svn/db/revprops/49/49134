add an optional scaling parameter to the autoview command.  this lets users override the default behavior, which is to scale the view to twice the model bounding sphere.  parameter is implemented as the model scale with respect to the view size so that .9 will give 90% view, 2.0 will give a model twice the size of the view, etc.
