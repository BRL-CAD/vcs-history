Can't take it any longer.  Doggy bag all the gcc vomit about SCL's qualified type errors.  Reduces the build log by about 16MB, 78k warning lines, approx 765 unique instances.
Quell them all with a teeny little one-liner bit of scripting based on the build log output:
for match in `grep  qualifiers build.log | sort | uniq | cut -d: -f1,2` ; do export file="`echo $match | cut -d: -f1`" ; export line="`echo $match | cut -d: -f2`" ; export pline="`expr $line - 1`" ; if test "x`sed -n ${pline}p 
$file |grep const`" = "x" ; then sed -n ${line}p $file ; sed "${line}s/\([[:space:]]*\)const \(.*\)/\1\2/" < $file > $file.sed ; mv $file.sed $file ; else sed -n ${pline}p $file ; sed "${pline}s/\([[:space:]]*\)const \(.*\)/\1\2/" < $file > 
$file.sed ; mv $file.sed $file ; fi ; done
As to the issue at hand, there is no such thing as returning a "const int".  It's just a value (same goes for all the non-pointer return types).  Old SGI compiler was one of the first to be pedantic about that mistake, but gcc wised up a few 
years ago and warns about it now too.
