the __extension__ keyword does not exist in gcc 4.1 and given the FD_SET() warning (so far) only affects gcc 4.6, make the work-around very unfeature specific.  this is only kosher given this is a b*.h system header wrapper, which aren't supposed to use cmake/configure feature test results.  this fixes an obscure build failure that was being observed on older systems that failed in backtrace.c with an error: expected expression before 'asm'
