Problem with MGED not being able to work with the version variable was due to brlcad_ident output containing the variable path - apparently Tcl didn't like the dollar-sign and curly brackets.  Seeing as that's also not the right path if someone does do an install, teach BRL-CAD how to get the actual path corresponding to a particular configuration in the case where the installation path is based on the build configuration.  Could have punted and required a fixed path for all configurations, but this lets make install tests for different configs proceed without stomping each other.
