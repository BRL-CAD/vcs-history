Make a stab at logic to clean out all files generated by CMake.  This is currently a bit too aggressive in that it will completely nuke the bin, lib, and share output directories, but it's a step in the right direction and seems to be able to restore a checkout to clean status after an in-src-dir CMake configure (although that's only tested on one platform and isn't yet portable - assumes Makefiles, for example.)  Not hooked into the build proper yet - it generates a distclean.sh file in the toplevel build directory that can be run manually.
