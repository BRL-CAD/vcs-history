add -mtune=generic to release builds in order to help ensure that -O3 compilations are still portable for a given target architecture.  this may or may not be the issue reported in sf support request # 3464421 but give it a try.  also, only set -std=gnu89 if we're a debug build.  that way you can specify NONE for the build type and avoid both std flags.
