add an initial implementation of a new CHECK_C_INLINE() macro for detecting legacy forms of specifying inlining.  this impl is loosely based off a snippet from Jack Kelly on the cmake mailing list except it avoids writing out a source file and only defines inline to something else if we need to.  alas, this implementation does cop-out and sets a global definition instead of letting the caller decide by passing in a variable, but it should work well enough for those legacy systems and compilation modes (like default icc compilation) that need it.
