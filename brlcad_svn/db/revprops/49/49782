The brep intersect routine was only looking forward of the ray origin so modified to include both positive and negative hit distances along the shotline(The calling rt application decides what to do with hits behind the ray origin). Also now storing 'dist' in the 'brep_hit' class to keep from recalculating distance for hit ordering(change original brep_hit constructor to now take an 'rt_ray', also added new constructor that also takes 'dist'). This fixes error found during VL comparison to BOTS when generating spall.
