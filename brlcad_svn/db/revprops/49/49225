replace 580 calls to bu_vls_init() with static initialization via BU_VLS_INIT_ZERO.  this eliminated the need for more than 100 conditionalized inits, which in turn eliminates the risk that a vls might get used prior to initialization (whereby it crashes).  this improves memory management as well eliminating the function call and memory allocation should the vls not actually be needed; and it eliminates a memory leak if a vls were initialized but not freed during an error condition.  overall, improved maintainability.
