Ah!  Using the symlinks for man pages shows us what was hidden - libfb man3 man page was converted to DocBook, but the old one wasn't removed.  Was just being copied over by the DocBook build with the old setup, but using symlinks for the non-DocBook man pages the changes actually got written back to the old libfb.3 man page and showed up in Subversion.  Actually a handy way to make sure we don't have strays left over after a DocBook conversion.
