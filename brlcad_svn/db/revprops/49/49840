Significant simplification of the distcheck logic - reduce it to two macros, one of which calls the other.  Add documentation, improve behavior in some corner cases, enforce a convention we already pretty much followed by default of using relative paths to specify source files in the source tree (this is a robust way to spot generated files in build target definitions, since support for an out of directory build requires that they be specified with their full CMAKE_BINARY_DIR output path.)
