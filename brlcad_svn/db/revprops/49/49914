Expand the power of distcheck again.  Add support for testing in-source-directory building, as well as adding checks of the distclean rule to all builds - again, including the in-source-directory test.  Define a couple more configurations for the 'distcheck-full' target.  Switch CPack source archive building from 'exclude what we don't want' to 'copy what we do want to a directory in the build dir and use that to generate the archive' - avoids having to worry whether CPack has the right list of things to ignore.  Everything now appears to pass, at least on Linux - there, distcheck-full succeeded.  What will happen with a multi-configuration tool like Xcode is untested as yet.
