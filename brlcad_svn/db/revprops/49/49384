fix rttherm.  demessify libmultispectral/liboptical pollution that got translated into bad cmake build logic.  move towards proper file/symbol separation so multispectral applications do not link liboptical.  this includes moving the env_region global from sh_text to init and not registering or linking non-multispectral shaders.
