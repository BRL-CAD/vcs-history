fix a major db5 portability bug introduced around 7.18.2 reading and writing ebm, dsp, vol, and hf primitives.  changing their dimension parameters to size_t didn't account for them being converted typeless via libbu's bu_vls_struct_print('%d') during export via int coercion into 32-bit data.  thus, 64-bit size_t's on a big-endian platform were writing out as zero (unless they happened to have a value that exceeded 32-bits) which ends up 'corrupting' the .g file.  fix is to make sure we stick to a 32-bit type so it'll export correctly.  as such, convert to uint32_t and document the issue.
