Variety of cleanups and simplifications - in particular, ADD_MAN_PAGES is now just a wrapper for BRLCAD_ADDDATA that handles the MAN_DIR setting - we need a MAN_DIR variable that includes the DATA_DIR for generic man page installation from other build systems, but since BRLCAD_ADDDATA assumes it just rework MAN_DIR to be appropriate for BRLCAD_ADDDATA and pass it through ftw.
