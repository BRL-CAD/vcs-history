Well, flawfinder is running now alright.  Complaining about chmod use in libbu's fchmod.c, but we're already using fchmod whenever we can - chmod is for Windows situations where nothing better(?) is available.  Don't want to hault regression on that, so remove flawfinder regression from the overall list but leave the target defined in case it's needed.
