rewicker logic to avoid strncpy()/strncat() altogether.  it's a memory buffer being read from, so just call memcpy.  also, there was no apparent reason for a buffer size of 94, so increase it to an 'even' 128.  this is nearly double what is needed (32+32+2) so there should be plenty of nul termination trailing.
