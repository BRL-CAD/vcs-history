Updated functions 'x_comp' and 'v_ptr_comp' which are compare functions for qsort called from within functions 'nmg_ptbl_vfuse' and 'nmg_model_edge_fuse' in file 'nmg-fuse.c'. When the compare function returns zero (ie equal), the behavior of qsort using 'Visual Studio' versus 'GNU C' is different. This difference was preventing qsort from sorting as expected on Windows which was breaking the MGED 'facetize' and 'ev' commands. This also impacted converters on Windows which must facetize the geometry before export.
