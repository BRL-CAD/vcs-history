header says null is a perfectly valid parameter to bu_strcmp() so there's no need to print it.  so get rid of the label parameter since it's otherwise unused. that means the function can take on the macro name and the macro can go away.  round out the offering with implementations for strncmp() and strncasecmp() too.
