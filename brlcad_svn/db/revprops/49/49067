fixed the database corruption bug being seen on 64-bit big-endian systems (sparc, power7, etc).  looks like the size mismatch was limited to the ebm, dsp, vol, and hf (deprecated) primitives.  issue caused by trying to serialize a 64-bit value into 32-bits without taking the input type into account (code assumes it's 32-bit) via bu_vls_struct_print('%d') serialization.
