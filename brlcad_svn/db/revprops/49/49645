overhaul the new CHECK_C_INLINE macro to fix a substantial bug (it wasn't actually testing different inline keywords...), but also to make it a much better macro citizen.  let the caller pass a variable in to get the inline value back, if any, no longer auto-adding to the global definitions.  support caching so we don't run the compile tests more than necessary.  finally, improve iteration and conditionals so we're more efficient and rename variables for clarity.
