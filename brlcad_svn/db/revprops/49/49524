Doubtful this gets to the heart of the matter, but when investigating an xpush crash valgrind reports memory being called uninitialized in the xpush free routines at xpush.c:90 is initially allocated by db_alloc_directory_block.  Somehow the dp->d_use_hd entry in question has a 'used' pointer pointing to uninitialized memory.  Should have it in the first place, but if we use bu_calloc in db_alloc_directory_block instead of bu_malloc we at least don't crash.
