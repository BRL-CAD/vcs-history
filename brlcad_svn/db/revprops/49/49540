GAH, revert the msse3 addition from r46520 as it invariably caused days of mysterious debugging for the exact same reason it was disabled in the first place.  you can't just turn on sse for binaries that are distributed since you'll end up with illegal instructions (crashes) at runtime.  debugged issue encountered on debian with jordi sayol and user notius, who was running .deb installs on a Pentium M system.
