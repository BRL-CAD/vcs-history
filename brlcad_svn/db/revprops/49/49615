First stage in properly supporting multi-config build tools like MSVC and Xcode.  This doesn't get either the right C_FLAGS settings (that will require some macro modifications to CompileFlags and friends) or build settings (if you're oing to get build-time profiles, it probably makes sense to have those handle a few things) but it does seem to place most of the files correctly for Xcode building.  Almost certainly breaks the Windows build (yet again) as it's untested there.
