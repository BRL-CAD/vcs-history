Getting closer - this leaves bin, lib and share in place but they should be nothing but a collection of empty directories for a bare configure.  Just need to teach distclean to check them for empty dirs and recursively remove any empty dirs until we've whittled it down to the minimum (for a pure configure with no build step on a clean checkout, back to the checkout configuration.)
