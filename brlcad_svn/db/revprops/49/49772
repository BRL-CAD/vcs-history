Go ahead and sync the toplevel files from https://github.com/mpictor/StepClassLibrary - not all of them apply to our branch as yet, but the idea is to sync the two trees so get these out of the diff.  Eventually we'll have a patch to submit back to the github project, so updates to these files for things like re2c/lemon will be part of that.
