Thank you Windows for tremendously complicating life.  The add_library command puts out two files on Windows - a .dll and a .lib - the dll goes into the executable directory and the lib goes in the library directory.  That means on Windows and only on Windows, the pkgIndex.tcl scripts are going to have to know to look in a different path.  This was hidden earlier by setting LIB_DIR to bin, but since we don't want to do that any more we can no longer ignore the problem.  Will take a fair bit of work to get this right - all the src/other logic dealing with Tcl will have to be updated.
