use the CheckTypeSize module's CHECK_TYPE_SIZE() macro for explicitly evaluating the size of a pointer instead of assuming cmake will figure it out for us.  this takes care of the problems assuming 32-bit on a 64-bit platform when the size can be determined.  unclear how cmake (repeatedly) got into states where the CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P ends up unset, but since it's a built-in test, likely just some bug internal to cmake.
