add the beginnings of a new regression test for API usage to make sure that common functions that libbu provides or wrapped are being used instead of their non-libbu counterparts.  we include exemptions for the implementation files that wrap functions and tester applications that compare them to the libbu version.  since there are so many matches, though, don't let the test halt regression until they're all taken care of.
