Added code to permit printing out the orientation, eye-pos, and
view size of the model.  This is what rtregis needs in order to do
the overlays.  At this time, the code compiles, but it is not clear
that the figures I get out are kosher.  The orientation looks
fine, but the eye-position is definitely strange.  The viewsize can
be argued with.
