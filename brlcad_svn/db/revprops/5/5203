Attempts to track down and eradicate the "Previously unreported overlaps.
Shouldn't happen" bug...
 1. Added code to compare successive overlaps and merge them if
    they share reg1's and reg2's and out_dist of one is in_dist
    of the other.  BTW, if this step is not gratuitous, then
    the comparison should be done in the other order, first comparing
    in_dist and out_dist, and only then doing the more expensive
    calls to strcmp().
2.  Add some diagnostic print stmts to pring out the entire overlap list
    at the end of each call to if_overlap().

END
