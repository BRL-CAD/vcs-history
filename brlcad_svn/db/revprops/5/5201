1. Added useair command and -u command-line option.
2. Replaced roll-your-own command-line syntax handling with
   use of GETOPT(3).
3. Added struct nirt_obj, the save parameter for do_rt_gettree(),
   and code in that function to maintain a linked list of nirt_obj's,
   one per call.  All this so that when we rt_dirbuild() and
   rt_gettree() again for the second rt_i (the different useair)
   we know what objects the user asked for on the command line.

END
