Moved the RT emanation plane to coincide with the GIFT grid plane.  This
produced results that John Hundley (Ketron) and Dirk T. Broek and John
Anderson of ASB found to be fine.  Also removed the trailing 0: it tunrs
out that that was supperfluous and GIFT just truncated the  last full line
I put out to just show the first 999.9.  Dirk and Bob Stadter (Ketron)
agreed I should leave the whole lijen in but just take oout the last 0.
Asked about  trailing 0 suppression in floatiing pooint numbers, the consensus was 
to leave them in.

END
