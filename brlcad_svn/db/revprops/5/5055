Use tgc_internal structure now, via new import/export interface.
Fixed suspicious code:
<       VMOVE( rec->rec_A, REC_A );
>       VMOVE( rec->rec_A, tip->a );
Formerly was using un-rotated/scaled version of A vector,
yet a few lines later, rec_A is clearly expected to have
the length of the scaled version.
If problems surface, look here first.
