Added a partition compacting subroutine to handle cases where a component
is made up of regions that are within a certain distance of one another
and all have the same region-id.  These should report as one component
rather than as a set of multiple components.  Part_comp() checks for this
condition and then collapses the partitions so that a component of this
nature is seen by only one inhit and oune outhit.
