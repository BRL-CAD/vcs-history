Untested as yet on Windows or with distcheck-full, but try to set up the run of 3dm-g with BRLCAD_ROOT set to the build directory so we don't attempt to pull in obsolete (or non-existing) GCV plugins during 3dm-g execution.  This is a brute-force solution wrapping a script around the running of the executable - if we have to do this more generally we'll want one script with arguments instead of a per-target scripting setup.  For now, go with the direct solution to try to alleviate the build problem many folks are having.
