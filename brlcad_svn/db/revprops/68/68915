consolidate all of the rtwizard window sizing changes into one entry: 1) this addresses user request from Josh Baker to have rtwizard name its window something other than the generic 'tk' to make it easier to find when minimized.  2) If the user sets the hierarchy view width, we want that width to stay constant between windows.  Also uniformly initialize to width 250 rather than on the lenght of the file name.  3) Have the default rtwizard image size key off of the mgedObj size.  Can be overridden by the FbPage.
