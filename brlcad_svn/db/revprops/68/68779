Taking a page from Archer, use the iwidget panedwindow rather than tk's version.  Untested as yet, but this should fix the crashing issue we were seeing on Windows when the panedwindow sash was agressively dragged (or slowly with no mouse let-up).  The new behavior is that the windows are not redrawn until the mouse is released.  Also has the side-effect of maintaining the *relative* ratio of the left and right panel sizes rather than expanding only the right panel size - I suspect a work-around for that may be possible but I haven't tried to implement it yet.  In the meantime, this should be an overall improvement in behavior.
