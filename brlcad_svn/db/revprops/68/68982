A somewhat more elaborate clang static analyzer script with more nuanced reporting of what is and is not expected to pass (and reports specific to each library.)  In a perfect world this would actually be generated by CMake - the major weakness of this setup is that the target list is static in the file and dosn't automatically update when the build changes.  Still, it's a start.
