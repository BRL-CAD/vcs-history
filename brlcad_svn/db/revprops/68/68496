heavily modify and restore the return and first arg of bu_basename() to still return the buffer and take the constant path.  the gci change in r59475 introduced a non-minimally impacting change that would have needed to go through deprecation announcement.  the restored sig (char*bu_basename(const char*, char*)) will cause a warning but is compatible with the prior (char*bu_basename(const char*)) and is minimally impacting with a NULL buffer argument.  the real benefit with the new form is that some callers can pass a buffer (e.g., stack-allocated) instead of requiring dynamic allocation, so some are updated to take advantage of this.
