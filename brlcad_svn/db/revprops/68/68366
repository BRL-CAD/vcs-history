Except for the core Tcl/Tk packages and incrtcl extensions, remove more unnecessary files.  The Tcl/Tk 8.6 upgrade will be the place to handle the former.  Also not working on stepcode yet - we need to get re-synced with upstream first.  That should be on the short list now that we've RELEASE branched for 7.26.0...
