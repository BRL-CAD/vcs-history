former platform regex was quite suboptimal.  go with a simpler but more relevant test for platform symbols used in a logical context.  also, expand the list of platforms considerably (intentionally avoiding a few platform names that also double as standard names).  performance needs rework as it now runs longer with more symbols being tested.
