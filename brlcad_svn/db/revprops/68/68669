Do less expensive matching tests before we go for the all-upregex match, although we have to be careful with this - common.h test, for example, looks for either system includes or common.h so we can't rely on a simple qualification test there.  If this works as well as it seems to now, cuts execution time from about 70 seconds to a little over 30.  repository.sh is about 21, so if we can execute individual tests in parallel we should get a significant speed up overall.
