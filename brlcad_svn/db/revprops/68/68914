directional lights created prior to rel 6.0 used the 'd {x y z}' notation to specify their direction.  this was changed to t/target, which broke all light sources and required the modeler to redefine the light.  this undoes the regression, restoring the ability to read the old .g files without error by putting recognition for d/dir keywords back.
