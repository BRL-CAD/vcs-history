might not survive release, but definitely user-visible if it does.  changed framebuffers to delay writes until the full frame is complete.  this is worse usability on long-run rendering since there's no interactive feedback, but considerably better usability on the more common case of things that take sub-second or even sub-minute rendering time.  hopefully the osg framebuffer will make this all obsolete.
