fix a regression introduced way back in 2000 (r19476) that breaks old models with directional light sources.  this was long before we had deprecation policy, but a detrimental regression nonetheless when the d/dir keyword was changed to t/target without adding any logic to upgrade the old shader strings.  restore the ability to read those geometry files and have their lights work by adding d/dir back to the list of recognized keywords.
