make the brep command apply a convention consistent with a few other places in our code, using .[PRIMNAME] (i.e., '.brep' here instead of _brep). probably want to reconcile with facetize and nmg commands doing similar format conversions (e.g., make 'facetize [-o new] old' output old.bot or old.nmg accordingly when a new name is not specified and make brep have a -o named output option.
