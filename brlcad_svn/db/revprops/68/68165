We will want to replace dbfind objname with ls */objname rather than search - for that particular option, search is too slow on large models to be a reasonable replacement.  dbfind, knowing it is only out to look one level deep in combs, can do its specific check much faster than search because it can limit the set of 'full paths' to check - search's more general filters preclude such special-case optimizations.  Fortunately, the ls command and globbing should offer another way to get at what we want.
