Looking forward towards moving nmg logic back into its own library, there are some initial in-place steps we can take to make the eventual transition simplier without actually splitting things into a library.  This removes a librt coupling by using bn_vlblock_init instead of rt_vlblock_init and explicitly passing in the librt list in question instead of assuming the presence of RTG.rtg_vlfree in the nmg code.
