this shell script is not intended for inclusion in the distribution, but it's currently the workhorse for the tcl GUI.  it shoots a 16-view grid of rays and aggregates all the overlap information into a table for prioritization (based on a rough volume estimate).  it also captures plot information for subsequent display.  this script should go away once the functionality gets recoded in tcl, but this was faster to get started with.
