getting ray tracing working in parallel on windows was primarily made real by two GCI students (in 2012/2013) that implemented the critical bits in parallel and semaphore, applied and reworked by daniel and myself.  never announced the change as it continued to be a topic of tweaks and debugging for a while, but now it's been in stable active use for a while and warrants broader recognition.  instant visible and substantial performance improvement, depending on the number of cores available.
