this is a terribly large risky commit, but not really many good ways to chop it up.  this converts all calls to the now-deprecated BU_PTBL_END to the type-safe and null-safe BU_PTBL_LEN macro.  that consequently requires propagating a slew of size_t type changes.  consequently found and fixed a bunch of 1-byte memory-overruns in the iges converter while converting types too.  regression testing passes on mac.
