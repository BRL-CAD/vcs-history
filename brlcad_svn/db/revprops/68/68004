Everything needing to use libgcv needs to also have its plugins available.  At the moment, the plugins depend on libgcv so this is not guaranteed by the libgcv linkage specification.  One thought would be to make a 'libgcv_util' library that implements common functionality for all the plugins, and then a thinner top level libgcv that isn't directly used by the plugins.  The latter can then set up build dependencies on the plugins, ensuring that a 'make libgcv' produces a gcv system that is fully ready to run.
