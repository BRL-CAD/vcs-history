Blegh.  What a nightmare.  The damage done to the embree branch in the 683** commit series by subversion's corruption of r63809 apparently wasn't repaired well enough for svn-all-fast-export to make sense of it.  Just skip this whole mess in the git conversion - at this point it'd be way easier to go back to the last clean revision and manually extract anything we need.
