merge the prep-cache branch into trunk, so it can be closed without any apparent prejudice.  some tidying up needed and different cache storage layout so it is multiuser safe, but this is looking like solid forward progress.  all testing is looking great too -- consistently seeing results like: 8min prep + 140sec render reduced to 40sec prep + 120sec render.  well done jon!
