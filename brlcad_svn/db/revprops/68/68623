Johnathan reproduced the failure of docbook to build with the BRLCAD_ENABLE_STRICT variable - turns out the error message was deceptive: rather than the xml input file being missing, the actual issue was XMLLINT_EXECUTABLE not being set.  The root cause turns out to be that when the conversion was made to do all docbook processing for a single input file in a single cmake script, the non-validating case was never tested.  Validation was *always* on, despite the original intent to have BRLCAD_ENABLE_STRICT control whether to do DocBook validation, and when strict was turned off the DocBook logic still tried to validate but without knowing where the necessary tool was.  Fix is two-fold - improve the error message so the missing executable won't report in such a way that it looks like the error is a missing xml file, and go back to respecting BRLCAD_ENABLE_STRICT for validation.
