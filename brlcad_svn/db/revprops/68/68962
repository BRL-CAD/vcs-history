not an end-state, but slight improvement on machines with greater than 128 cores.  with recursive parallelism, the number of subthreads is technically unbound, so we'll need some a better method for tracking ever-increasing quantities of threads (and how to do so while ensuring MAX_PSW containers remain consistent).
