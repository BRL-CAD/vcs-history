The plugins are using GCV_EXPORT, so the BRLCAD_ADDLIB magic (which is based on the target name) isn't setting the correct export definitions.  With this change bu_dlsym is no longer returning null, but it looks like putting the runtime and non-runtime outputs in the same build directory may be causing other problems.
