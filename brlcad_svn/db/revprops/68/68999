rewrote the .fr file parser as the modern format has changed since this code was written.  seems like some original assumptions or limitations are no longer true (or were never supported) like no aim/fire points in a view or only one aim per view, etc.  updates I made lets you manually call the underlying functions (e.g., muves_draw_shot 1234) but more work would be needed to bring this code back to life and that's probably not worthwhile for us to be doing that here.  left debugging in because who cares. ;)
