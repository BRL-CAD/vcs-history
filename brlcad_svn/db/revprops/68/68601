file(STRINGS ...) in CMake isn't up to giving us correct line numbers.  After some misadventures looking into whether grep could be bundled as a portable utility, finally realized that we can use the FIND and SUBSTRING subcommands of CMake's own STRING command to chop up the text the way we need.  Only the last platform_symbol_usage_test function has the correct solution implemented - need to fix the rest and clean up, but wanted to checkpoint what appears to be a working state.  Probably need to make this while loop more robust - test what happens if there's not newline at the end of file, for example...
