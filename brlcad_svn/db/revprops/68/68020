Since we don't have Tcl 8.6 and its 'file tempfile' implementation, add tcllib's fileutil module to get access to ::fileutil::tempdir.  Needs review/testing, but this should give us a reliably writable place to put file copies, and should avoid Archer refusing to start up when installed to a non-writable system location.
