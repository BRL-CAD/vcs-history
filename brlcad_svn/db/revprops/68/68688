Make the cmake outputs a bit closer to the repository.sh output.  CMake matching is slower than repository.h, but we're also catching some cases like src/mged/qray.h:38: #ifndef _WIN32 that I'm not seeing in the repository.sh output.  Maybe it's time to see if the unifdef program can be used to do the symbol extraction piece, rather than cobbling together regex patterns...
