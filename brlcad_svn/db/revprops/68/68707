add recognition for on/off as boolean string values for cmake-style compatibility and convenience with env var string parsing.  removed t/T/f/F for true/false, but still need to make sure nobody was relying on that shorthand (tcladjust in particular).  made all testing case-insensitive.  fixed the unreachable final return.
