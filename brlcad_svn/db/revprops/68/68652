spent some time debugging the mac initialization issue.  looks like it's ogl-specific and double-buffer-specific, fixed by doing a swap buffer after 'gui' command completes.  this is achieved by calling dm_set_bg().  several dm funcs swap the backbuffer, but setting the color explicitly gives clear intent despite it being unclear why this is needed or why the front buffer contains garbage.
