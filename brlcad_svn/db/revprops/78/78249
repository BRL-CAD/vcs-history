Start a simple Qt viewer for the isst visual.

Main goal is to figure out how Qt's OpenGL widget will work
with the texture based approach to data display.  ISST's
visual is a working example of displaying raytracing results
with a texture, and is also fairly self contained as far as
the rest of the dm/fb software pipeline is concerned.

Noticed also that the Tcl/Tk version of isst doesn't want to
start, at least using a system install of Tcl/Tk on Linux.
