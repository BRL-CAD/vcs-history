Grr.  The CVS branch assignments based off of git rev-list --first-parent proved unreliable - Sean noted that we can check the CVS .v files to get explicit branch information, and it looks likethe SVN assignments were correct.  I may be wrong, but it's looking like Git just conceptually does not retain this origin information at all.  Stash the set of revs->branches, so we can fix the commit messages with repowork.
