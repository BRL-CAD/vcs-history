More hunting... I think some of the 'mystery' itcl commits may be coming from a CVS scriptics branch that doesn't appear to have made the translation to SVN, possibly because it looks like the scriptics branch notation/numbering in CVS may be incorrect per https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~rhl/cvs-branches.html#branchnumbers ?
