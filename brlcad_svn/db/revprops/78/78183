Avoid duplicating call to nmg_kr() in g-iges

OSX is getting a crash, and valgrind on Linux reports an issue
with db_free_tree called from g-iges.c:646 getting an invalid
read.  The comment with that db_free_tree line indicates
db_free_tree does an nmg_kr call, so it looks like this prior
call in the same routine was interfering.
