Add some more utility scripts for repo comparison

Having assigned SVN revisions to most of the git commits,
that opens up another option for comparison - generating
diff sets from multiple git SHA1 commits that should
correspond to SVN commits, and looking for differences.

In an initial trial, a little less than 10% don't generate
matching diffs.  We've observed what appear to be occasional
differences in how SVN and git calculate their diffs.  Since
MD5 sum comparison only works when the diffs are exactly the
same, the approximate matching script uses ssdeep and comm
instead to get a sense of how different the two patches are.
