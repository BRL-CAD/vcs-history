Reviewing the CVS era empty commits, some of these have no uniquely useful messages.  Deliberately leaving some empties that either have a commit message or appear related to a branch in some fashion, and not altering the SVN era empties (many of which document branch additions/deletions) but we should be able to clean these up.
