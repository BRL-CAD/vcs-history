Remove combtree_i structure from npush - unneeded.

Was making things too complicated by assigning IDN matrices
to dp_i instances on the way down the push tree - combs will
need IDN matrices, but only when writing the comb instances
in the .g file.  In the meantime, we need to keep the "current"
matrix state in order to recognize situations where we're going
to need to copy higher level combs with the dp_i instances.
Once non IDN matrices are recorded rather than thrown away, we
don't need any detailed look at the comb tree itself - the
matrix encapsulates the uniqueness (or non-uniqueness) of the
comb.
