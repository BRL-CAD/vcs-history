Set most of the stock variables needed by the pkgconfig files - need to figure out what to do about the link lines.  Ideally, those would actually be generated based on the BRLCAD_ADDLIBS link libraries list, but even if we leave them hardcoded we'll need to set the variables used for system libs at configure time.  Probably will involve wrapping the CHECK_* logic in some more macro foo.
