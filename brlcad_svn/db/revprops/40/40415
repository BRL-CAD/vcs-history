Tcl/Tk packages need to know where the *Config.sh files are, and have exec-prefix set to avoid writing to places they don't have permission to write.  This MAY imply that there is no need to look for headers if the config files aren't found, but need to think about that - right now that's the effect of the FindTCL variables, so the include stuff in the section section can probably go unless there's a need to have headers without config files.
