Since we're never going to want liblib as our prefix on a file name, have our add_library wrapper catch target names with lib in them and turn off the lib PREFIX in the target properties.  Now if we decide to rename all the lib targets (e.g. bu->libbu, bn->libbn, etc.) all we have to do is rename them.
