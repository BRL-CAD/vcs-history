I had wanted to leave the src/other build logic untouched, but unfortunately the external CMakeLists.txt files have their own ideas about man page locations and iwidgets was ignoring the --mandir option.  Maybe zlib and png will apply a patch to make this behavior default?  Worth trying.  Iwidgets is probably just going to have to stay a local patch.
