Adding bundle ray shotliner rt_shootrays() as plural version of rt_shootray(). Follows design aspects of rt_shootray() with user definable callbacks for bundle hit/miss functions. Also added a couple of ray pattern generators rt_gen_circular_grid() and rt_gen_elliptical_grid(). Added bundle capability to 'rtshot', to test simply supply "-R (bundle radius in mm)" and optionally "-g (bundle grid size in mm)". A "-X 0x80000000" will produce an "rtshot.plot" file of the bundle that can be overlaid onto a target in 'mged'. Ex:
rtshot -X 0x80000000 -R 25.4 -g 1 -d -0.5 -0.5 -0.7071 -a -5821.27 618.726 3678.75  target.g all
