OK, successfully used tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh to pull values.  Unfortunately this is apparently not sufficient for Windows, where these .sh files don't exist, and apparently also some Linux distros only install them with the dev packages.  Need to take a 'best guess' if those files aren't found
