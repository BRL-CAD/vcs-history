No idea if I'll get away with this, but rip out the C calls to Itcl/Itk init routines and replace them with package require calls.  Also need to define ITCL_VERSION in brlcad_config.h since we're not directly using the itcl/itk headers any more.  Also take out the while loop in bwish and just call the routine to add BRL-CAD path info up front - should be harmless if nothing there and odds are very good we'll need it.  Much simpler, and also simplifies the build logic considerably - no need now for private tcl/tk headers in libtclcad and bwish CMake files.
