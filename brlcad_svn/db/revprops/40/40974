Within function nmg_je “nmg join edge” instead of freeing the source edge inside nmg_je, the edge is marked so the calling function can free the edge. The source edge does not always need to be freed, it depends on if it is still referenced by something else. It is necessary to only mark the edge to be freed since some calling functions are checking if the edge has been freed by checking if the magic is zero. These calling function are basing logic on values in freed memory which is undefined. Either the logic in the calling functions should be changed or do not free the edge within nmg_je, let the calling function free the edge. For now, let the calling function free the edge.
