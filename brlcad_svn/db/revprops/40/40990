fix a bug reading from stdin within mged with gets.  the gets command that mged defines was trying to save the current execute_cmd as execute_cmd_save but after immediately creating/initializing the proc to empty.  the proc has to be deleted, which can be done by renaming to an empty string.  this bug was reported via the forums by gilliganu (https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/forums/forum/362509/topic/3847236)
