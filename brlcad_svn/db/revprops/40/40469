Add in some missed CMakeLists.txt files, and start working on bwish.  FindX11 paths by default weren't finding Xi on gentoo, so now have local copy of FindX11 with expanded paths.  btclsh and bwish appear to truly need the itcl/itk C libraries, which means the next step is to back up and add a C component to the Itcl/Itk definitions both for Find and for local compiling.
