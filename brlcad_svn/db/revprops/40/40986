Sigh.  OK, this is obvious in hindsight - just as openNURBS needs DLL defines passed in, so too will the BRL-CAD libraries.  These are from the project file - not clear how many of them are actually needed and how many (if any) can be safely left to parent add_definition calls - that'll take some reading and maybe testing.
