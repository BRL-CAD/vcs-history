after seeing nick waiting over an hour for a vertex fuse to complete, a quick peek at the code made it quite apparent that there was a possible O(n^3), or maybe O(n^2) + O(n^2), algorithm being used to fuse vertices.

this implements bin-sort space partitioning where vertices are spatially grouped in one dimension into bins so that only nearby vertices need to be compared.  the new approach is asymptotic O(n) (albeit with a heavy linear constant).  the savings are proving to be quite substantial with fusing 150k vertices going from 50sec to 0.7sec and nick's 1.7M vertex data set going from over an hour to just under 4sec.

still need to verify that bot compression of deleted vertices is working, but the iterative bin sorting is already tested along with efficient minimal spatial vertex comparisons.
