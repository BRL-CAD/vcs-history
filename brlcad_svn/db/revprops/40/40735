Exposed PkgClient::flush() with Portal::flush() in an attempt to get the writes working.  Added a handshake logic checker in to Portal::handleNetMsg() to prevent two portals from continually sending RemoteNodenameSetMsgs to eachother. Removed the pkg_switch table generation from Portal cstr since it is generated prior to Portal init.  Removed some debug statements and added yet others to support continuing t-shooting.
