instead of doing a cheap ass compression manually ourselves, just call rt_bot_condense() which does the same thing (but butter) and will even go a step further to reclaim memory.  add some sanity checking to make sure our bot doesn't already have vertices with infinity values, and a final pass to make sure our book-keeping is correct with no deleted vertices remaining after the condense.
