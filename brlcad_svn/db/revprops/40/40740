Don't wire it in yet, but get the subversion code and its apr requirements into the main rt3 module.  At the same time, start working on a FindAPR module to conditionalize the eventual ExternalProject logic for apr.  Need to check the FindSUBVERSION module to see if it spots subversion's libraries.
