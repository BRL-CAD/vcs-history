Need to consolidate the library and binary path validation into one step in order to preserve the search order.  Also, simplifies the logic somewhat - at the expense of a few extra highly improbable directory checks, seems to be worth it.  This should simplify the no config file case a bit, since the directory order is organized by version number found and within that search order.
