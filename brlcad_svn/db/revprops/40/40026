Gonna need to set the PNG options ahead of the ADD_SUBDIRECTORY call in the THIRD_PARTY macro unless we want to require two passes before building - has its drawbacks since if an external png lib is used these options are useless, but mark as advanced to hide them from casual site.  Could be worse - it also highlights specific functionality needed by BRL-CAD.
