Much needed love to FindBRLCAD.cmake.  Script now looks for the presence of a BRLCAD_BASE_DIR cmake variable to derive brlcad's bin/ lib/ and include dirs.  If BRLCAD_BASE_DIR is not present, then a search is conducted on the Environment Variable 'PATH' for the appropriate dirs.  Changes to this file propagated to g3d and coreinterface.  Additionally rolled up the Major, Minor, and Patch version finding logic from the coreinterface CMakeLists.txt into FindBRLCAD.cmake.  Its good stuff and could be useful elsewhere.
