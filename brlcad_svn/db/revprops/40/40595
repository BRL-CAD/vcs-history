Hopefully this will do it - there appears to be some (fairly legitimate) confusion from the build system when we don an enable-all build, have libpng, libz, etc. in the build lib directory, and then turn on the system versions of the libs on top of the built enable-all build.  The answer appears to be to remove the built libraries when the third party options are switched - entails a fair bit of rebuilding, but with any luck the vast slew of error messages in that case is gone now.  May also want to nuke the static outputs, have to think about that.
