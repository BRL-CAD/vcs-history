The LIBSTDCXX variable is used only in misc/pkgconfig/librt.pc.in (which already includes LIBM anyway) and src/other/step.  This test is somewhat difficult to set up in CMake - the standard CHECK_LIBRARY routine won't do it - and since it shouldn't be an issue anywhere except src/other/step remove it - if step libraries need the LIBM option add it.  Will have to set up an OpenBSD system to check this out.
