Take a stab at a noprod rule, based partially on the uninstall example from the CMake FAQ.  This is an 'all or nothing' command - it will flush ALL lib and exec products that cmake knows about, not just those in a single directory.  If we want per-directory control things are likely to get even trickier, if it can be done.
