This appears to be about the minimal change to get this working - IncrTcl's use of the private Tcl headers is a severe problem when trying to build using a system Tcl/Tk - in practice, it shouldn't work at all.  The workaround is to use the headers from the local Tcl/Tk when building - this works if the system version and local version are compatible.  We need 8.5 from the system version now too so this should work without needing to add local copies of the 8.4 headers.  Revisit this when tcl/tk 8.6 becomes stable - this is Really Ugly.  Adding options to pass in args to avoid the complications of  setting CPPFLAGS portably in a CMake ExternalProject configure command.
