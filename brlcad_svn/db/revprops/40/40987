This appears to be the minimal set needed with the CMake files in their current state - it seems likely the BRLCAD_DLL option should be higher up the tree, check tomorrow for how it's used. Also, need to confirm build status of 'normal' Windows build - libbn is complaining about _bu_debug being unresolved when I try to build it with nmake, even with libbu.lib getting generated.
