Updated function bn_coplanar. Improved the algorithm, used distance tolerance for testing for coplanar, used a very tight tolerance (<= SMALL_FASTF) for testing for parallel. Since these are planes, if they are not as close to parallel as we can measure then they will intersect. Added bu_bomb for invalid input. The input test will slow things down some but, for now, it is better than cascade failure.
