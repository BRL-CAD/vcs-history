Change this a bit - have each of the 100 forks try to get their own number into the repository.  I'm not quite sure how to interpert the result, but I think they are encouraging - of the 100 attempts, only one succeeds (somewhat at random) and all of the others report conflicts when trying to do an update.  I think this is correct behavior.
