this commit could use an additional pair of eyes to make sure I caught all the cases correctly, but the intent is to make 'size' only refer to the object size, not the entire buffer size.  this way, we get the same minimum buffer protections that r_weiss fixed in r40389 but allows calloc() to still be passed count and size.
