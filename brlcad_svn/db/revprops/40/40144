and with this tiny tweak, we can eliminate the triple object compilation (once pic for tea, then pic+nonpic for the libtool library).  we don't actually need to build the nil library, we just need the convenient object rules that it provides so that the tea lib can build.  does the trick nicely, though switching off tea to libtool may be desirable down the road as takeover continues.
