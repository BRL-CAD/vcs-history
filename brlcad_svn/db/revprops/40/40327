Needs a lot of corner case testing, but enable the flags for thread support and add the graphics test to the non-config-file logic.  In principle, this completes the original targeted feature set of this FindTCL implementation.  In practice, I'm sure there's more work to do to support Windows and probably some coner case stuff not yet caught, but it looks like it will be usable in this form to continue with building BRL-CAD on OSX.
