Since PkgCpp/Pkg is handling the msgLen, remove it from the NetMsg class.  Also, convert msgType to quint16, rather than quint32.  I rather doubt we will need 4+ billion message types.  I also imagine that we could easily get away with <256 msgTypes, but for flexibility's sake, lets stick to < 65,535 provided by quint16.
