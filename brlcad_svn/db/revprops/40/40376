adjust the annoying default c-label-minimum-indentation from 1 to 0 so that labels are consistently aligned to the column of the scope they're in.  this was causing goto labels to get pushed forward to column 1 in emacs 21 (fixed in later versions).  also make sure we don't indent namespace content as well as inline functions.
