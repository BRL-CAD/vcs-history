Start getting set up for reading patch level version info from tclsh.  Also, ensure all the determined values end up in the cache.  This routine is a bit expensive to have running over and over, so conditionalize it on TCL_FOUND - if there is a change and one needs FindTCL to run again, just pass -DTCL_FOUND:BOOL=0 to the cmake command line.  I'm not sure about this setup - it may be against standard practice for CMake - but it's easy enough to remove if need be.
