rework the logic so that cssprop.c is not half-hazardly being dropped into . or src/. depending on the mood of build fairies.  get rid of the horrible VPATH causing most of the problems.  this allows the built source rules to actually work by letting them find their resources.  add a nil libtool library for testing and with that, we can get rid of all the .o rules.  still need to manually specify that all of the sources are dependent on cssprop.h so that parallel make will work.  this seems to do the trick for a straight up build (but now compiles object files in triplicate).
