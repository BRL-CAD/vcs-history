This file replaces ALL the Tcl/Tk find functionality in CMake, so we're going to need to handle the stub libraries as well.  Also need to figure out what to do with threads - parse for it in config file case, maybe run script in non-config file case?  Finish stubs and threads, make sure conditionals are respected, and tie up loose ends - after that it should be a question of platform and robustness testing.
