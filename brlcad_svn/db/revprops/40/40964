This gets slightly closer to building tcl/tk on Windows, but with the following restrictions - need to use the nmake generation, not MSVC (limitation of tcl/tk builds), so far tested only with command line cmake invocation, and tk build is still failing (common.h is asking for stdint.h and its not found, need to check out why.)
