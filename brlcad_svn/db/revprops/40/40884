Tweaks to FindSVNLIBS - not clear yet if this will actually build svntest, will probably need to verify the support the version of the svn_* functions being used.  svn warns when using older versions of these functions, so we can't get a clean build unless we stay 'current', but doing so also means older libs won't work - a bit annoying.
