fix the remaining places where we do math with SMALL_FASTF and SQRT_SMALL_FASTF, which is a no no.  those constants are defined as epsilons near zero, which can result in no operation when added or subtracted from a number that is not near zero.  this results in unexpected expression logic where cases like '1.0' < '1.0 + SMALL_FASTF' evaluates false -- they are equal because SMALL_FASTF is too small (consider nextafter() or a larger epsilon value like VDIVIDE_TOL).  instead of trying to do math with the small values, shift the expression and equivalently just compare against it.
