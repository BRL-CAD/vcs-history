Move view_obj, the last remaining bit in obj.h, into bview.h.  This may not be technically minimally impacting, since the interp type is changed from Tcl_Interp to void, but it also appears view_obj was only ever used in libged/view_obj.c (the other obj.h includes were removed without trouble.)  All in all, my take is this is close enough to 'non-published' and minimal enough to go with it (, but if not this commit can be reverted.
