Add one of the pieces of NIST2 that was causing problems for the convex arbn detection as its own independent test (independent B-Rep if the subshape was generated for debugging, turned out to be a useful way to capture a 'piece' of a B-Rep in its own object for this situation.  Might offer an interpretation of a 'split' or 'disassemble' subcommand for breps.
