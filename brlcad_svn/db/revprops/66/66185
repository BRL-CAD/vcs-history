quell pedantic-error warnings from the gct decimation code for static inline functions that are fully defined in their header but not necessarily all used in a given source file (but potentially used in other source files).  instead of chopping things up into tons of headers, just quell the usage warnings by creating a function that uses them.   only addressed the specific static inline functions that were causing unused function warnings.
