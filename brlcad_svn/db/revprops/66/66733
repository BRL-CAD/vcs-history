this apparently goes all the way back to 31394 - qray doesn't actually operate on the database.  Instead, it changes settings in gedp.  So it doesn't need to check if the database is open - in fact, mgedrc typically has settings that set values for qray.  That's why we were seeing error messages in ged_result_str when we had the problem with ged_glob not truncating down the result string.
