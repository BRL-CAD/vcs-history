Looks like strsep was introduced into asc2g a long time back (25912 or earlier) for early Windows porting work.  strtok has been part of Visual Studio since at least 2005 per https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2c8d19sb.aspx, so we can fall back to the original strtok implementation.  The strtok version predates the use of strsep and was always present as a fallback anyway if HAVE_STRSEP didn't work.  Removing since this is the only use of strsep in the BRL-CAD codebase.
