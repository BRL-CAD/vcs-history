this fixes where the previous attempt at eliminating a floating point equality test went wrong.  '1.0' equals '1.0 + epsilon' for really tiny values, like our SMALL_FASTF.  that meant we lost the equals case (creating an open set) and got incorrect grazing behavior on tgc.  you can do comparisons with values that small but not math, so here we shift the test and get the correct behavior.  on quick review, a lot of places throughout the code are getting this wrong.
