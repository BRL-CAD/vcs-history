restore 66249 with allocation sizes fixed.  was attempting to pre-allocate the first child, but the containers are only filled via push_back (instead of index).  this leaves an unset entry when we iterate by size and kaboomage.  unrelated, tested and observed no performance impact on an unoptimized build (before/after).
