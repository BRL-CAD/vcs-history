Use the bu_path_component approach to the problem icv_guess_file_format was trying to solve.  Eventually we'll probably want a bu_path_mime function that will try both extension and file introspection (probably with an adaptation of libmagic logic for BRL-CAD's needs: https://github.com/threatstack/libmagic) but until that function is available use the generic libbu level API for this rather than introducing an icv specific function.
