remove the 'parse_points' command and associated parser sources.  it was never properly documented, hasn't been an active area of work in a long while, incurred a maintenance cost, and can be revived if/when needed again.  for archival searching, the interface read in points from a csv text file (commonly output from metrology equipment, e.g., ArcSecond Vulcan) containing one per line and a label with a convention implied for each label type (e.g., PLATE was n planar points that formed a closed loop followed by a triple-repeated depth point).  to be really useful, this interface needed to be integrated during aquisition (e.g., with mged running on a tablet) so that error points could be deleted (instead of having a delete/undo convention in the point stream) and progress viewed interactively.
