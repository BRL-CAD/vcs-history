Some clean up for consistency - an island having multiple active loops in a single face is defined to be self intersecting in the csg conversion context.  Avoids the need for triangulation with holes altogether, although that is left in place since it is needed if we go ahead and enable triangulation of planar top level islands anyway at some point.  For now, go with consistency and simplicity.
