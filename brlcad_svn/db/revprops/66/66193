annoyingly add a wrapper header for including sys/resource.h, sys/time.h, and sys/wait.h -- all of which involve sys/resource.h which requires jumping through hoops in order to support glibc <2.9 (i.e., rhel5) with strict pedantic-errors c89 compilation.  while annoying that it's necessary, permitting header guards (while not including common.h) does shorten many instances of code, to follow.
