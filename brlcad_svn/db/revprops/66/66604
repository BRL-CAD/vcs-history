Not sure at this point if __attribute__ (()) is legal with the space, but we have instances both with and without.  The GNU documentation has a space in the form description but none of their examples have it.  The rest of our __attribute__ labels don't seem to use the space, and clang 3.7 is known to have trouble with it in at least one case.  Remove spaces.
