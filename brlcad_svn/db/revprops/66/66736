Remove most of the make_*.sh scripts.  Leave rpm and deb for now, since they show relatively recent activity - rpm should be done through CMake but this may have logic not ported to CMake yet, and we don't yet handle deb in CMake.  dmg also comes under the should be handled by CMake but isn't yet category - can't tell if this script is still useful, so, leave it for now.
END
