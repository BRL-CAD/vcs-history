wrap the warning disable functionality into a generalized function so we can use it in two places without duplication.  there's minimal utility exposing BRLCAD_DISABLE_SRC_OTHER_WARN as a user option since it's easily commented out and unlikely to be something toggled with any frequency/regularity, so we remove that as well.
