* Broke SPR.h/cpp into multiple functions as to make it a more suitable API for
  a library and in the hopes to replace code inside the PoissonRecon.cpp Execute function
  to use a common code base.
* Added an 'inline' keywaird to many of the functions in the '.inl' files to fix some
  multiple definitions compile errors.
* PoissonRecon_new.cpp is my 1st attempt to replace the code in the Execute function
  with a call to functions to do the processing.  I could not get the code to compile
  when including 'SPR.h' so I copied some of the code in the 'SPR.h/cpp' in here and 
  was going to get back to the compile issues later.
