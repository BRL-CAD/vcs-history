let's pretend setenv() is not needed.  already setting DISPLAY via tcl and the reason for calling setenv in the first place wasn't documented.  probably older buggy versions of tcl didn't set DISPLAY properly causing rt to pop up on a different window when run from mged.  might be worth removing the Tcl method as well, though, since invoking on a remote device doesn't seem to be working any more.
