after much pinpointing, revert the specific portion of rweiss' change in r56016 that made perfectly slicing through the ends of a tgc/rec a miss.  this subtle change causes geometry to be missed which cascades into different analysis results.  more inspection warranted, but this restores behavior for a patch release.
