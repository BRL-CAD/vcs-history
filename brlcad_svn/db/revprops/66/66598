For the time being, go ahead and commit this - Add clang static analyzer attributes to bu_exit, bu_bomb and bu_badmagic letting it know they don't return.  This is not strictly true, and longer term it may be worth updating our logic to properly handle the situation where bu_bomb *does* return, but until we reach the point where we're ready to do that the noise from these functions drowns out the signal.
