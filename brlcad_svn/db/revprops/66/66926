undo c66903 that changed TODO instances to @todo doxygen form.  would be nice if we can keep the simpler more visible and readable markers, plus MSVC and other tools recognize them by default in that form too.  for this to work, try utilizing the doxygen INPUT_FILTER option in our config to pre-process those markers into doxygen markers.
