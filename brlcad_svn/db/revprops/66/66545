we need to disable more than just warnings on the generated sources because the sdai and clstepcore headers are included in pretty much every single source file.  instead, test for the few warnings that are getting spit out on the stepcode sources.  this lets us continue to get warnings on our code, minus the few that are pervasive to stepcode.  this is okay because our code is now fully scrubbed of all the msvc /W3 level warnings.
