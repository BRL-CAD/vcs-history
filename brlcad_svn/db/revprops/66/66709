Untested as yet, but teach bu_path_component to return mime types.  Should be able to consolidate image conversion and geometry conversion type guessing using this approach.  Expands the scope of bu_path_component a bit, but it already was able to get file extensions so it's a convenient place to add suport for returning an actual mime type without having to add a new special purpose function.
