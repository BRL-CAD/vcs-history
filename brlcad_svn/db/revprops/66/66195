including linux/sysctl.h (via sys/sysctl.h) on at least the 2.6 linux kernel is problematic with -pedantic-errors because of a slew of trailing commas in enums.  gcc 4.1.2 is apparently buggily reporting them despite it being under /usr/include too.  conveniently, the sysctl interface is available without including sysctl.h, so removing the header works; though will need to test what this does on other platforms, maybe come up with a more robust test.
