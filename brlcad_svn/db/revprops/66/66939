Take another stab at fixing vertical flip of pngs written by screengrab. Looks like the problem was actually inconsistent coordinate convention in implementations of dm_getDisplayImage, so flipping was only happening when using ogl/osgl. Now flipping gl buffers to make them all the same for screengrab.
