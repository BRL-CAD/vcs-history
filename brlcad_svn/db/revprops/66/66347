it's wrong to report 'rt_init_resource(...) re-registering resource...' when the resource we're cleaning up is the rt_uniresource.  it doesn't and shouldn't get registered in the rtip for cpu 0 as you could both have per-cpu resources and use the uni.  if we really ever do encounter a situation where the rtip has something different registered, just set it and continue since it's more likely that the thing we just cleaned is not released memory.
