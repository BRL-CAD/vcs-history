Merge libdm and libfb into a plugin based library.

This commit merges the dm-fb-merge branch's combination of libdm and libfb into
a single library, using a new plugin-based architecture for platform specific
backend logic.  (The merger supports a clean plugin design - libdm and libfb
must share backend specific information for features such as embedded
framebuffers.)

This commit marks a major milestone in that it is the realization of a
years-long effort to lift Tcl/Tk usage up out of the core BRL-CAD libraries
(libged and its dependencies.)  Although it is true that Tcl/Tk is currently
needed for all available graphical libdm backends, the new plugin-based
architecture means Tcl/Tk is now a requirement only for the plugin itself,
rather than all of BRL-CAD's libraries.  There is no longer a practical bar to
graphical libdm backends being implemented that are fully independent of
Tcl/Tk.

There are some API changes to support plugin loading and information hiding,
but existing libdm/libfb users should find most functionality relatively
unchanged - the libfb functions have not been reworked into a new API, for
example (although someday that may be desirable to streamline the libdm
design.) The major changes for developers will be including dm.h rather than
fb.h, linking libdm rather than libfb, and using "struct dm" and "struct fb"
rather than the dm and fb typedefs.
