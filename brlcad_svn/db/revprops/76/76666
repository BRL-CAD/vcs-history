Make a stab at pushing down the DM-specific event functions into libdm.  The dirty flag needs more attention - as MGED is using it, the scope appears to be all DMs rather than each individual instance, and there's no internal 'this DM is no longer dirty' reset post-draw at the moment (as one would expect for a DM scoped flag of this sort.)  Need to better understand the relationship between DMP, stuct dm_list, and how it should or shouldn't relate to bview.
