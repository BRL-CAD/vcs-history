Add the point inside/outside test to cg

This supports two operations - intersection and subtraction - between
a point cloud on the left and a volumetric object on the right.  It
will find the subset of the points in the left hand object that are
either inside and on (i.e. intersecting) or outside the test volume.
Command form is:

cg eval "pnts.s + sph.s" inside.pnts

cg eval "pnts.s - sph.s" outside.pnts
