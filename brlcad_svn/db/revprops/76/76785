document the checks being used by BU_CKMAG since they're fairly low-level operations.  add a direct check for nullity, too.  will have to keep an eye on whether the null check provokes an unreachable expression warning on linters (e.g., coverity).  shouldn't be redundant on a platform with non-zero valued null pointers.
