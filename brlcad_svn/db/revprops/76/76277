Start looking at what a Tcl-free asc2g will need.  This a tall order and not really possible in the general v5 ASC case, since for v5 asc2g makes available libtclcad's commands and evaluates the asc file as a Tcl script.  The practical approach looks to be:  a) bring over v4 parsing without Tcl, which seems to be present in asc2g.  b) identify the subset of commands used by g2asc for v5, and implement parsing and evaluation for those commands specifically c)  IFF b fails to read a file and Tcl is enabled during compilation, fall back on the libtclcad Tcl evaluation to import the file.  Fully executed, we should be able to handle anything written out by g2asc without Tcl (assuming there aren't actual Tcl syntax evaluations buried in v5 somewhere) and if someone has manually altered or created a more complex file that actually hard requires Tcl we'll support if if Tcl is enabled.
