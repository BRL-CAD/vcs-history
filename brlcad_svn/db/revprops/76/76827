Very simple cap on the number of times this message is printed.  bu_logging from the hit callback is generally not a great idea to begin with, since you'll have lots of threads simultaneously hitting bu_log most of the time...  even if that's not an issue for the application it's fairly hard to interpret.  Better would be to store any information we want to report about this issue per-thread and then summarize it at the dispatcher level...
