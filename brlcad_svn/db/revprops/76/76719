Git's sh.exe on windows is expanding the /dev/debug string into a path, which is breaking the check.  Just write the rt output to a file that is immediately removed instead.  Longer term we'll have to figure out what to do about sh.exe - it's breaking running rt with -F on the command line as well - but for now this should get the test running.
