Auugh.  VS clean target exists all right, but it doesn't seem to be happy with the solution file generated by CMake - claims there are two regress targets defined, even though grep only sees one.  Possibly some variation on this issue?  https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/3019  Fall back on just the distcheck script.
