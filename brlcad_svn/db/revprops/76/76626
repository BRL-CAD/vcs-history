felt wrong because it definitely is wrong.

ged_init() is responsible (as are all init/INIT functions/macros) for
initializing ALL members of the ged struct.  accessing the struct
directly, outside of libged functions, is in the wrong direction too.
fields should be opaque caller.  this is tight architecture coupling.
