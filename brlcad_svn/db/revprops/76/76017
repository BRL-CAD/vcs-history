libicv doesn't expose a generic way to set gamma on all images, and as far as I can tell these options were never actually used by any fb2png callers.  The other options seem to test out, although width and height don't do the expected thing as far as capping how far in X and Y the image is read.  I believe this is due to the PIX image format, where this isn't possible since they encode no size information - w and n must therefore always specify the whole image width and height.  It probably indicates we need a couple other file_ options if we want to properly support extraction of image subsets.
