Couple odd things about these updates - in particular the mac_hack file data block size was slightly different?? - but updated so they can be applied to the current state.  Since the tag sha1 values keep getting updated, improve the script that finds them for us given the availability of the older git conversion - the manual mapping was a lot of work, so we don't want to have to redo it if we can preserve the knowledge by sha1 lookup instead.
