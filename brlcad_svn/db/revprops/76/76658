Tcl_Event and the File/Channel mechanisms might prove to be a headache to replace, particularly portably/cross-platform.  This (very crude) experiment with std::thread gets rt output to print, but rtcheck crashes and it's clearly sub-optimal in any number of ways.  What we need is event based I/O reads from the subprocess I/O streams, but not sure how to do that portably yet.  The stand-alone version of the Boost ASIO library might be a possibility, but their wrappers for POSIX file descriptors and Windows HANDLE mechanisms exposes the platform details much as Tcl's does.  Haven't found a better option yet...
