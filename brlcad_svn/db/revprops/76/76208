For C++, newer standards let us do std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1000)) and avoid redefining sleep.  Qt's qthread.h doesn't like our (re)definition, so see if we can restrict it to C only - a quick check doesn't seem to show much (any?) use of sleep in C++ in our current code...
