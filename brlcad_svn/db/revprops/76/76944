Runtime display manager type switching with dmtype never worked all that well, and currently doesn't work at all.  Move the type reporting function (dmtype with no args reported the currently running dm type) to a subcommand of the dm command where it should have been in the first place (dmtype -> dm type).  Remove the runtime dm type setting - to change MGED display manager types, alter the mged_default(dm_type) property in .mgedrc
