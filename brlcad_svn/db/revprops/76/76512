Checkpoint some work trying to set up to use CVS checkouts to rebuild individual 'bad' CVS commits.  In principle the idea is similar to the svnfexport fallback which does a deleteall + full tree commit when the delta processing doesn't produce a matching checkout, but this time we are trying to do it without requiring a 2 week rebuild...  repowork should allow for selective commit redefinition if we do it right.  Will also have to produce blobs and tree states from the CVS checkouts... ick.
