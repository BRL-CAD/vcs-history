This is the source of the bu_malloc(0) report and dauto crash log in the usage.sh run.  Need to validate the numerical conversion before trying to malloc memory.  Still not sure why I was seeing intermittent failure to print the usage message, but so far can't reproduce that failure after fixing this.
