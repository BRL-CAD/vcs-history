Still can't determine why bu_exit is an issue in these cases (only commonality seems to be bu_exit called right after isatty - not sure why that would matter...) but bu_exit isn't really necessary to print the help msgs.  Just bu_log and return.  usage.sh can complete its run without throwing bombs now on linux, although one or more programs are producing a '-?' file rather than intepreting ? as a help option.
