Assign a magic number to the ged_subprocess structure.  This lets the callback validate that what was supplied in the void pointer is in fact the type of struct it is expecting.  Wouldn't be so bad if it just crashed reliably at that point, but hit a case in the handler refactoring where the wrong struct getting passed in had adverse but non-crashing effects - slow, ignoring keyboard input, etc.  Need to get this in place for the other callbacks, not just those using subprocesses.
