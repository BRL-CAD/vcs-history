made MS Visual Studio happy by fake-DLL-exporting classes, quell warnings regarding possible class function conflicts inside and outside the DLL, hopefully the clients are happy too (not tested yet)
these classes are in fact structs with only some trivial inline functions
This change should not change any bahavior!
