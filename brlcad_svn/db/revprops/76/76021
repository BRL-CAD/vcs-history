screengrab and overlay have the new icv logic - remove the icv2fb and fb2icv commands.  Restore png2fb for the moment to keep full compatibility for older codes, but we should be well positioned to begin phasing out fb2pix, pix2fb and png2fb in favor of more generic options.  In the meantime screengrab and overlay have new functionality.
