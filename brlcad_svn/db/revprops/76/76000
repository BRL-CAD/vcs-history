provide flawfinder an explicit list of files, shaves 17sec down to 12sec.  excluding realpath_bsd since it's not our code, even though the reports is a genuine security concern with readlink.  the 3rd party code is properly nul-terminating and checking return codes, but it is vulnerable to TOCTOU attacks and buffer truncation.  don't have a good answer other than finding better/different 3rd party code without this vulnerability. ugh.
