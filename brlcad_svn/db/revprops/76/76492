Add a utility intended to use the svn metadata in the git comments to do a svn vs git comparison - in a sense, this is the mirror image of what the original conversion was doing.  Will be slow to run, but in princile can diff every post-CVS commit.  Pre CVS is more problematic - there's not a guarantee things will line up, as witnessed by the need for a sync commit between the CVS and SVN histories, and the checkout pattern will change once we get old enough.  Can be done if someone wants to badly enough, but the guarantees of matching aren't really there due to cvs2svn vs cvs2git differences so the utility is a bit iffy.
