Fix transparent display and framebuffer windows.

Some configurations of Linux desktops (including default Gnome setups
on Ubuntu and Redhat) have started using transparency by default. This
has resulted in an odd semi-transparent window for default ogl display
manger and framebuffer windows.

Fix this by adding a filter the X11 visual choosing functions that
rejects any window reporting an alpha mask.  With this filter the
selection returns opaque windows and restores the expected rendering
appearance.
