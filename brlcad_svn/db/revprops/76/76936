Needs more testing, but adjusting the setting of the dirty flags gives saner behavior with the classic X libdm backend.  Still can't embed the X dm backend in Tk with 8.6 - that seems to be a different category of failure - but this allows the X dm to function in classic mode.  Checkpointing a state that shows progress.
