not safe to assume 0/1/2 actually correspond with stdin/stdout/stderr

go through the std vars as they are more likley to remain semantically
aligned to a corresponding in/out/err descriptor even if
closed/reopened.  this API still assumes too much, but there's not a
good alternative that doesn't entail significant rework at this point.
