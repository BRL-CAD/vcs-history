Listen for both stdout and stderr output from the rt tools - this gets the summary in MGED GUI mode, but we still don't get anything at all in classic mode.  Not sure why yet.  tclcad_create_io_handler is being called, but Tcl_CreateFileHandler is never triggered so _ged_rt_output_handler isn't called.  Apparently this was also true in 72189, as the output is printed without the callback ever being triggered there as well...
