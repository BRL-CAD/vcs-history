One of the things an eventual superbuild migration will require is a separation between CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and the ultimate BRLCAD_INSTALL_PREFIX (the latter being the superbuild's ultimate installation destination, as opposed to the local paths used to install the intermediate subbuilds.)  BRL-CAD itself would be build as a subbuild in this scenario, so it would have to target an install step to a local CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX but still have a different installed location 'baked in' to the code itself via the configure headers and rpaths, which is something we haven't previously done.
