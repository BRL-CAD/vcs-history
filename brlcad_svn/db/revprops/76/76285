Pull the g2asc logic from g2asc.c and rough it into the respective gcv plugin files.  Not working or close to it - just figuring out which pieces belong where.  For v5, once we know what we're writing out we'll know what we need to read in - anything added to a .asc file not written by g2asc will promote an asc file to an all-up Tcl script needing the full libtclcad logic to evaluate.
