Switched gdiff to using multiple specifications of -v rather than numerical arguments to -v to control output verbosity, which is a more normal approach to this feature.  Provide a -q option to back down the verbosity as well that operates in the same manner (default output is not quiet, so need a way to back down.)  They will interact - '-v -v -q -q' will result in the default output verbosity.
