Add _core suffix to avoid conflicting with the name-specific wrappers to ged_exec in the main libged library.  Eventually we may want to consider deprecating all of the ged_* specific function calls in favor of just ged_exec, in which case this won't be an issue, but for now we need to avoid the conflict.
