gdiff filtering option previously required a match on both sides of a diff result to filter - switched behavior to apply the filter if either side matches.  Example -~ when attempting to filter out a result involving the removal of a region_id, '! -attr region_id=-1' didn't work because it only matched one side of the diff.
