For commits on multiple non-master git branches, assign them to the branch they are on with the oldest final commit.  This may mis-assign some older commits that were actually made on another branch and then merged, but we seem to be hitting the limit of what Git can tell us.  A few of these might show up as failed CVS checkouts in a validation attempt, but I'm not sure how else we would spot them.
