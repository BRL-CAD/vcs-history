Combination Editor's buttons were improved all around to gracefully
handle empty combination names and do the right thing, depending on
whether the combination name or expression or both are empty.  This
addresses a user-reported issue with the Combination Editor where
pressing Apply could result in a mislading error dialog about
comb_control(id,attrs) not being set.  All around better behavior.
