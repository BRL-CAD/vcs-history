Add a BRLCAD_ENABLE_TCL option (defaults to ON) and fix up remaining build issues with Tcl fully out of the picture.  Protect liboptical's sh_tcl.c to allow liboptical to build without Tcl (should really have liboptical use a libdm style plugin setup, but this is lower impact for now and liboptical's API doesn't seem to expose any Tcl bits), conditionalize various other bits of the build logic that were assuming Tcl as a given, disable a bunch of regression tests needing Tcl based utilities...  Large swaths of the code are of course turned off (libtclcad, mged, archer, various utilities, etc.) but cmake -DBRLCAD_ENABLE_TCL=OFF should now work.  See if distcheck logic needs updating - once a full distcheck can pass in this mode, need another distcheck-full regression test for this configuration.
