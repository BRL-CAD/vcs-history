Was quite involved to create a poly solid for testing - deprecated, can exist only in v4 databases (gets converted to bot for v5) and apparently only the nmg_simplify command offers a path to creating one (and only when a v4 .g is open - wipes out in v5 with an export failure).  Now that I've got it, stash it for testing purposes.
