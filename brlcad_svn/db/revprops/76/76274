Latest git cvs-fast-export changes the output of our conversion, introducing a few differences in the SVN/CVS comparison.  Not sure which answer is 'better' at this point, but the difference appears to be cvs-fast-export populating some RCS tags.  We're deliberately trying not to expand those at all for any of this, so use the cvs-fast-export version used when the original splicing work was done.
