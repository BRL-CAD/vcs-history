Rather than fatally aborting when we find a command mismatch on a named ged function call, warn and override with the "root" function name.  This should work in every case the command would originally have worked - the only failure would be if there is a command that the plugin is supposed to be providing that didn't get set up, which would be a legitimate bug on libged's end.
