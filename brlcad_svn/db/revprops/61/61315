Generally speaking osgViewer does well as a framebuffer container, but the trackball handler isn't appropriate for this application.  Start customizing the OrbitManipulator from OSG to suit the framebuffer use case - for now, just turn off the mouse's ability to rotate the image in 3D.  Will need to figure out how to make it do more later - eventually, can try sending it back upstream for OSG inclusion, if it gets good enough.
