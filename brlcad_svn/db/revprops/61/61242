Added missing hint parameter to header for SwapUVSeamPoint(); Made face_GetBoundingBox() & surface_GetBoundingBox() public; added additional surface types to surface_GetBoundingBox() so that surface gets cast to proper surface type. Added face_GetBoundingBox() function that uses UV bounds of face for tighter 3d bounds.
