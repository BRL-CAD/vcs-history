Something about r61095 broke raytracing via the render button in Archer by causing fblabel's call to vfont_get fail. Rtwizard assumed the error was from the port being in use, and its subsequent behavior left things in a bad state. Work around the problem by having rtwizard check the fblabel error code to ensure failure is from fb_open, not vfont_get.
