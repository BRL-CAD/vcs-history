Add a (very) basic example of specifying constraints via flatzinc (http://www.minizinc.org/specifications.html) using the perpendicularity test with length equality constraint.  This is interesting as a tool-independent language - we might be able to teach librt primitives (for example) to generate flatzinc specifications for their constraints using tolerance settings as inputs to flatzinc templates, and then pass those in to libpc (which would make use of gecode's flatzinc support initially, but could in principle use any tool that speaks flatzinc or for which a flatzinc translator could be built.)
