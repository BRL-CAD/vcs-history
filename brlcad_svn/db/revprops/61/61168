Add a -param option to search (needs more testing.)  This will allow searching based on internal parameters of an object (as opposed to general attributes) provided those internal attributes have a tcl list representation.  It has so far successfully used 'mode' as a filter for listing volume and plate BoT primitives, and a couple other parameters.  Probably will need to add a table listing the valid parameters available for the various primitives to the search man page, since it's not immediately obvious what the possibilities are.
