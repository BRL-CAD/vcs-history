Added additional tolerance to surface_GetClosestPoint3dFirstOrder() and trim_GetClosestPoint3dFirstOrder(), parameter "same_point_tol" is used to stop the solver and return true when it gets to a solution within this tolerance, parameter within_distance_tol" is used to return true if the closest solution found is within this tolerance (meaning we couldn't find anything closer but we will settle for this). Also added a tolerance to ConsecutivePointsCrossClosedSeam() which is the tolerance used for the IsAtSeam() check.  Added rendition of surface_GetIntervalMinMaxDistance() which takes as input the bounding box instead of the surface and interval to be used when caching the bounding boxes. Added addition logic to resolve curve loop ambiguities when point lies on a seam or singularity looking at both previous and next points along loop.
