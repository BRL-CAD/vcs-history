Created function surface_EvNormal() that wraps functionality of OpenNURBS 'surf->EvNormal()'.  OpenNURBS surface EvNormal() was failing when at surface singularity but not on corner of domain. If fails and at singularity this wrapper will now reevaluate at domain corner.
Also made IsAtSingularity() public and added tolerance input parameter. Also created rendition of IsAtSingularity() that takes ON_2dPoint instead of u,v.
