Added new 'brep' sub-command 'UV' to draw 3d bounding box from input UV intervals:
  command - brep somebrep.s plot UV surface_index u1 u2 v1 v2
  mged> brep brep.s1 plot 0 1 5 0 10
Can also be used to draw 3d iso of U or V by forcing one or the other to same value:
  V iso at v=5 - brep brep.s1 plot 0 0 6 5 5
Also added plot usage for 'UV' and missing 'Suv' sub-commands.

END
