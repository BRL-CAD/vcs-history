Added name cleanup and improved auto-naming when names are blank. Removes leading and trailing single quotes(') as found in STEP file. Maps extended ASCII set to explicitly mapped replacements to sensibly replace diacritic characters(code >= 192). Replaces non-alphanumeric characters with underscores(_).
