Move the arb editing arrays out of globals.c into an rt subheader.  Both MGED and libged have versions of edarb.c, and we need to consolidate that code down into librt so they have a common place to look.  arb_edit.h will be 'BRL-CAD internal' the way we're planning for the libbu subdir headers to be internal.  I'm not really sure what this should look like as actual librt API - probably some sort of functab that returns a list of callable operations or some such - but in the meantime the rt/subheader.h approach at least gets things out of global space and allows us to move forward.
