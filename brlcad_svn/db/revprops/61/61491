finally fixed, the key was using 'set -f' to fully disable glob expansion filepath matching.  this really simplifies the regular expressions by avoiding the need to escape glob characters (sometimes, when they match a path). avoids an evaluation escape-hell.  this gets the filesystem and product summaries working cleanly and adds a DEBUG option for inspecting the matching filesystem entities.
