The insertion mechanism for the sortedMaster array performed very badly in the case where a large file has a batch of low-id-number entities towards the end of the file.  Tossing in std::map in place of that array avoids the bad corner case, but we may pay a performance penalty in other situations - depending on what the bottle necks are, this may be work revisiting.  For now, this seems to work well enough.
