Added support in Archer's file open dialog (and also when specifying files on the command line) for automatic invocation of BRL-CAD's geometry importers.  In the GUI case, some of the formats also provide dialogs for specifying parameters to the converters.  Supported formats at the moment are 3dm, FASTGEN, stl, and STEP.
