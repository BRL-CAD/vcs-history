Get the simulate command compiling with the bundled Bullet.  It doesn't seem to be working, but it's not immediately clear why - the command does run and produce output using these instructions:  http://brlcad.org/wiki/Mged_simulation, but without any transformations applied.  Most likely explanation is the migration to the new API needs more work in our code...
