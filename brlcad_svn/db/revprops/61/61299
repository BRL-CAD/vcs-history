Added our own version of ON_BrepFace::Reverse(int dir) which was copied and slightly modified. OpenNURBS versions will make a duplicate of the original surface only if the "surface use" count > 1 otherwise it reverses the original surface. This led to problems where "second use" needs to reverse but is unaware that a "first use" has already reversed the original surface. This version makes a duplicate of the original surface whenever it need to reverse.
