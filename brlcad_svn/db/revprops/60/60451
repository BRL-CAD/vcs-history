In some cases union_intervals would be handed an empty list of intervals, which would cause an exception to be thrown and valid face intersection curves to be discarded. Allowing for empty interval sets (which are valid) prevents the spurious exceptions, fixes 8 test cases (4 subtraction, 4 intersection) and improves 5 others in 'librt/tests/brep_boolean_tests.g'.
