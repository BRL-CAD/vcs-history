stub in a -f full/force flag to killtree so that the default behavior can be to skip killing objects that are referenced somewhere else in the database.  the -f flag makes killtree ignore any references and proceed before.  this should alleviate an unintended consequence if objects in the tree being killed are referenced elsewhere.
