If .g names can have spaces (something we are seeing a *lot* more of in geometry imports) we have to quote the objects returned by db_regexp_match_all - otherwise, MGED treats the names with spaces as two or more separate names, with rather incorrect results.  Not sure if this will cause any problems anywhere, but it does not seem to disturb make regress.
