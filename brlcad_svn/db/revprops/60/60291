Just stl-g so far, but produce a Tk dialog that allows the user to set conversion options when opening an STL file.  STEP doesn't need it, but 3dm does and most of the others will.  For all importers we need the redirect of stderr to make sure we get all the output from verbose modes, so add that.  Also, echo the actual conversion command as the first line so we can see what the conversion command attempted actually was.
