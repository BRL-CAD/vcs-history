RT_NURB_EXTRACT_COORDS is returning the dimensionality of the nurbs curve points (e.g., 2d, 3d, 4d).  for whatever reason it supports varying dimensionality (probably as a means to store both uv and 3d control points, or rational and irrational numbers, in the same container).  don't just tack in another depth to the logic and leave the comment turd.  the dimensionality of points needs to be greater than zero for this loop to work at all, so just check that it's what is expected.
