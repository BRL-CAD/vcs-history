Start working on an API for ged results returning.  Way to introduce it incrementally will be to have a (part of ged_private.h, probably not needed as public API) function ged_results_add which updates both ged_results and the return vls at the same time - that way everything will look the same to functions expecting the results string until we can update them.  Can we get away with having *just* the struct ged_results; decaration in ged.h and let the more specific definition with (for the moment) the bu_ptbl as contents live in ged_private.h?
