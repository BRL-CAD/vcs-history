Instead of dragging the resource variable all over the place, just use &rt_uniresource in the one place we actually need it.  dbip->dbi_wdbp->wdb_resp wasn't initialized when archer tried to do a search, causing a crash, but as long as we can use &rt_uniresource here we don't need to worry about it at all.
