Make a stab at creating an osg event handler that calls framebuffer updates - since nothing shows in the viewport when using a viewer currently (might have to draw to a texture and paint it on triangles for the scene graph, as opposed to the current raw opengl?) this isn't immediately useful.  Checkpointing it because it does seem to make the call when the event occurs.
