end of an era.  rebirth anew.  rework configuration tests so we can properly support compile-time version API.  we start with just stashing the information into config variables.  not intended as a permanent solution, but is a workable one that will suffice as long as brlcad_config.h is installed (which it shouldn't).  these version values should be a template (or two, one for version, one for ident), exapanded during cmake.
