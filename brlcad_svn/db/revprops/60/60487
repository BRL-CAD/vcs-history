allowing movement on a core sounds like a great idea, but apparently too clever for the default linux scheduler.  multiple threads are getting assigned to the same core (on the same cpu), leaving one or more cores idle (even though their affinity mask clearly lists all N cores before and after they're set).  ugh.
