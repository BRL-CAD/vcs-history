Back up and take a different approach to OpenSceneGraph integration.  Rather than re-engineering our whole system up front, recognize that OSG is designed and intended to be a wrapper around OpenGL.  Use our existing OpenGL drawing code, but replace the X11 specific calls with their OpenSceneGraph versions.  Need to do some more work with fonts and a few other pieces, but the initial test is successful.
