keith encountered unexpected behavior where equality/zero testing was resulting in failures due to expecting closed set behavior.  the current macro is implemented as an open set.  this commit provides two alternatives that effectively to the == epsilon comparison without actually requiring IEEE floating point equality testing.  this has the potential to be catastrophic, though, so lets be careful and test this thoroughly first.
