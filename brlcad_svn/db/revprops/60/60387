Gah.  Ubuntu is apparently adding --as-needed to ld linking by default now (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8814707/shared-library-mysteriously-doesnt-get-linked-to-application) which in turn messed up the openscenegraph linking for BRL-CAD.  Better solution here is to figure out *why* it's concluding it doesn't need those libraries, but until then here's a temporary work-around...
