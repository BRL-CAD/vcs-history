Modified hierarchy build to use the related/relating product definitions of the 'Next_Assembly_Usage_Occurrence'entity to order the assembly.Changed isVerbose()/setVerbose() access functions to Verbose()/Verbose(bool) respectively. Added code to pickup dangling BREPs related to SHAPE_REPRESENTATION through SHAPE_REPRESENTATION_RELATIONSHIP.
