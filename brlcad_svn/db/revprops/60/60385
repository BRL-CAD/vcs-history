Make a stab at adding a functional ged_results interface.  One consequence of this (or, more correctly, of the need to quote object names in applications) will be that all formatting of output (like, say, the multi-column output from ls) will need to become the responsibility of the calling application, since the assembly of the final string for such multi-column output can't happen without the strings being pre-quoted.
