killtree default is to now skip killing any objects that are referenced elsewhere in the database instance.  this is to prevent killtree from leaving dangling dead references elsewhere in the database (in other top-level objects, for example), which was the prior behavior.  there is a new -f force flag to override this behavior (restoring to the previous default) which will kill the hierarchy dispite any references.
