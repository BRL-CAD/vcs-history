It looks like the issue is rather more fundamental.  Essentially, when we invoke the viewer, we're activating the 'this is a scene' aspect of openscenegraph and that doesn't appear to interact well with the low-level drawing calls in the framebuffer.  Several options here - figure out what's going on with Tk's events, see if something a bit more modern like glfw makes a better container, or map adrt's 'framebuffer is a texture on triangles' approach to the libfb framebuffer drawing.  All have drawbacks, but it looks like digging deeper into Tk is what will have to happen, at least in the short run.
