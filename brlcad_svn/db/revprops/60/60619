use a dynamic array instead of a fixed one in order to avoid an array overrun altogether.  curious that gcc 4.8.1 would warn about size 40 but not 400 when the order value can be passed from a caller or read from disk (i.e., it can be anything).  using dynamic mem lets us remove the overflow detection which got out of sync after r56921.
