fix regression test breakage introduced in 60016 (can no longer introduce new _WIN32's) by eliminating all of the WIN32 blocks around setmode() calls.  we can just make that function a no-op for now, but might consider a bu_setmode_binary() or similar if it causes confusion.  for now, go with the simplest solution.  eliminates 30 of them.
