This adds a Tk window based on tkcon that will stream the output from geometry converters and provide some user feedback during the import process (in theory it can do the same for exports too but that's not set up yet.  As a little added bonus, the output is also written to a log file for later debugging.  Still need to hook in most of the converters and figure out a way to pop up some customized options panels before building the conversion commands (which may actually build the command build to the gui_conversion.tcl file, since that's the most likely place to have the panels.)  Still, this at least provides some real feedback instead of just freezing Archer for the duration of the process.
