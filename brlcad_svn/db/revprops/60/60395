Went too low level in the APIs and wasn't getting the initialization code I needed to call.  Short term, create and delete a viewer to make sure all the right setup is called.  Longer term, study how the osgviewerFLTK example works in osg and find out if it makes sense to retool how we are embedding osg in Tk.
