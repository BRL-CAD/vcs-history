header reorg is partially complete, but add some thoughts about subheaders becoming public API.  i don't think we want that, so we'll need to include a guard so that only the main headers are used. (e.g., #if !defined(INSIDE_BU_H) && !defined(BRLCAD_BUILD) #error "Only <bu/bu.h> should be included directly." #endif)
END
