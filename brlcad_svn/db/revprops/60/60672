keith improved pipe ray tacing in r57269 where there was an error in grazing cases where you have legitimate in/out hits on same surface but less than 0.00001 dist.  per his description: For the pipe we don't expect to hit the same surface within such a small distance unless it is a grazing case in which we really want to remove both hits. Also changed the hardcoded '0.00001' constant to the internal distance tolerence. Also removed related conditional that reported the original error and bailed.
