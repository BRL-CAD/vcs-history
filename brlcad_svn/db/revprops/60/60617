document what this little bit of magic is actually doing.  it's setting up a luminance conversion table (ironically for 8-bit and 1-bit greyscale displays) where values are factored by three precise factors (0.299, 0.587, 0.114) but we do the math here in integer space to avoid floating point error accumulation (and perhaps originally for performance too).  this commit changes the loop to not multiply table values, instead accumulating them via addition, which should hopefully avoid the gcc 4.8.1 error that Tom encountered.  credit to Widelands (sigra, r3180) for the method that improves upon our initialization.  gotta love open source round tripping.
