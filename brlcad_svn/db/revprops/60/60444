keith improved the newton solver iteration in r55755 for rays that would occasionally converges just slightly outside the UV domain. it was assumed that they'd get picked up by the adjacent subdivsion bounding box but that wasn't always the case resulting in speckling, particularly for implicits converted to brep.  he added a tolerance check that makes sure these hit points aren't getting dropped.  no more speckling.
