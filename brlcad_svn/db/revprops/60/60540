Make the check for public headers including private headers part of the CMake process.  It's currently configure time (ideally it would be build time, but that's more compilcated) and will check the CMake lists of private and public headers as defined in include/CMakeLists.txt.  Should make the repository.sh regression test obsolete, but needs testing to be sure of that.
