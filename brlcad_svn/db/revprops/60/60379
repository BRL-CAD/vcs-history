Pull the chances impacting command functionality - should be using bu_str_escape and friends to do the tcl quoting, and should be happening at the app level once we teach libged to return something that lets us operate properly on a list of object names (problem is libged returning a space separated list, when spaces are in the object names it needs to be returning as well...)
