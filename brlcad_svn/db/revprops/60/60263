make db_search() take a dbip instead of a wdbp so it doesn't give the impression that it writes to the databsae.  this greatly simplified the implementation functions where both dbip and wdbp were being passed around everywhere.  also updated at least the calls in g-step to use stack memory and release the results (was memory leak).
