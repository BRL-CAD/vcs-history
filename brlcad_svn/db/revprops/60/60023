Get us ready for CMake 3.0 - either fix issues or (mostly) quiet warnings related to new policy rules from CMake 3.0.  The LOCATION property is used fairly extensively, so that's going to be a bit of a trick to avoid.  Not clear yet what a 'correct' approach would be.  Fortunately, if we set that policy to OLD we can carry on.
