Add an option to quote ls object results - Archer seems to pre-build an ls list and then post process it (??) so we're doomed from the start if tcl doesn't get the ls resulting names quoted. This is probably insufficient, in that it does not protect from other active Tcl characters in names (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5302120/general-string-quoting-for-tcl for examples) - something like using libb64 to encode/decode base64 for all internal string uses that do not directly involve printing output for the user may be in order...
