put in place new versioning API that not only supports run-time version testing but also compile-time testing.  includes a new BRLCAD_API() macro for use by 3rd party codes (instead of a compound number based on the version triplet).  no longer uses the version files directly, now relying on the cmake variables (which are derived from the version files).  intended as a interim method as a better solution will be to make brlcad_version.h and brlcad_ident.h be templates that are expanded during cmake.
