Addressing the r60630 FIXME, rewrite get_point_inside_trimmed_face to use a deterministic grid-based algorithm. The new implementation succeeds in the six cases from our brep_boolean_test.g where the prior RNG algorithm failed, though one of those six cases now evaluates incorrectly due to issues later in the pipeline.
