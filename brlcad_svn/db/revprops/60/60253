reduce nested scopes (shallow is better) which unveiled a memory leak when/if null dp's are ever encountered.  the comments on reuse of the start_path indicate there may be another misunderstaning or leak here as well.  it's getting allocated every pass of the loop regardless of intent, so restructure the code to make what's going on more clear (not obvious to me which was really intended).
