merge r60470:60474 from the RELEASE branch to trunk implemented in support of compile-time API version testing.  this replaces the compile-time integer from r55789, instead providing a BRLCAD_API() call for 3rd party application use.  the eventual solution should be to make brlcad_version.h and brlcad_ident.h be a template, expanded by cmake, but this new API should remain unaffected as long as calling codes adhere to the published API and not the brlcad_config.h symbols.
