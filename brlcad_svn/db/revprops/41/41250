I believe this successfully updates the subset of Boost we use for spirit to Boost 1.44.0/Spirit 2.1.  Basic approach was to include the main header for spirit in a test case, duplicate the directory structure of the pre-existing boost inclusions, attempt a file copy of the same subset we included, delete any that no longer existed, and add any missing that g++ complained about.  Need to revisit this with the bcp tool to make sure things are correct.
