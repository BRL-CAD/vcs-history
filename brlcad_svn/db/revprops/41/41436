Fix a bug that had to deal with the selector loop in PortalManager occasionally missing a read.  Turns out there is an underlying select() call deep in libPkg that reads data from a socket and buffers it internal to libPkg.  That select() call is called on both high level read and write operations.  However, on the write op, the data that is read from the socket and NOT 'dispatched', thus the callback never gets called.  The quick fix for this is to make the PortalManager's select() call only block for a short period of time, AND to attempt a Portal->read() regardless of select()'s return status.  Its a polling type hack, but it works for now.
