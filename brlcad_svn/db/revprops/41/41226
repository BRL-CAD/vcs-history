improved robustness of boolean tree parsing by fixing a 12 year 10 month old bug in db_tree.c:rt_tree_parse() where we were proceeding with a corrupt tree if the left tree was non-empty and right tree was empty.  cause was a simple copy/paste error, fix was to check the right side for validity so it'd release and unset right tree resources correctly.
