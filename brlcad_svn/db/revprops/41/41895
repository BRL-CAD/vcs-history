Add copies of fonts we are interested in using for BRL-CAD applications.  dejavu is too large to be added without being in live use, but put the smaller ones in to ensure they are around in case a website goes down or some such.  (Especially in the case of ProFont - expanding the StuffIt file was not entirely trivial, don't want to lose the effort.)
