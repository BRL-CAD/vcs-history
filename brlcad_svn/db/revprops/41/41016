OK, with these tweaks FindTCL can spot an activestate install.  The good news is the tclConfig.sh files are also present in a Tcl install, which means the reading of that file appears to be a legit universal detection method.  Need to use that to simplify the FindTCL script.  Checking for C:/Tcl covers the default directory for a local install that doesn't alter the registry keys.
