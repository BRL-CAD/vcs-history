damn I'm good.  implement some scary mad shell scripting here in order to kill long-running conversions while still timing them and capturing their output.  to make this happen, we can no longer just use a here document fed to the 'while read' loop because the kill signals sent to the children processes jack it up good.  instead, temp override stdin with our object list so the loop continues unabated.  add in some timer cleanup for the instances when we finish the conversion long within the time limit and we have a done deal.
