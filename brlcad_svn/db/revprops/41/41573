Updated functions 'nmg_boolean' and 'nmg_booltree_evaluate'. Removed 'nmg_model_fuse' from the function 'nmg_boolean' and placed it within 'nmg_booltree_evaluate' which is later in the boolean process and is where all the geometry is location in a single nmg model structure. This change appears to improve 'facetize' but further testing is necessary.
