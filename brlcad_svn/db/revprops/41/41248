For the BRL-CAD build, our use of CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY means we need to stick the library files in a place tcl can see them in order to run 'in build tree', which is needed for building other parts of BRL-CAD.  Need to think about this a little more and check it for building in isolation.
