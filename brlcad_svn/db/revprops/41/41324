rename cnt to siz to reflect that it's not a count ala calloc() but that it's a size ala malloc().  also remove the doxygen comment on bu_realloc() since public API comments for libbu are all included in the public interface headers.  implementation files only include doxygen comments for significant implementation details that are noteworthy.
