add an initial, useful, and VERY informative script that walks over all objects in the geometry file(s) specified and reports which will successfully convert to nmg as well as bot.  notably interesting that many nmg succeed while the supposedly trivial subsequent conversion to bot sometimes fails.  also interesting that several debug messages seem to be escaping stdout/stderr redirect.  work is performed on a temporary copy so original input is unmodified.  example use: sh conversion.sh db/*.g
END
