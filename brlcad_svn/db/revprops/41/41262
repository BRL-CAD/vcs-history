OK, referred to the trunk bwish to figure this out - need the auto_path set by tclcad_auto_path if the default init fails - I'm not sure why we wouldn't want to use the tclcad paths for bwish by default, so just put the call in until it's clear why we shouldn't.  Add the paths we need for this CMake build configuration - looks like we'll need at least one, probably two more entries in brlcad_config.h to make this properly generic.  Take care of that after fixing itk build.  It is interesting that tclsh succeeds but btclsh does not (by itself) - are we missing some init code from tclsh?
