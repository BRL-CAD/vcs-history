Updated the 'bntester' tool used to test 'libbn' functions. The basic framework for testing the 'bn_distsq_line3_pt3' function is almost complete. The code was written to make it easy to add new functions to test. Placed some sample test data within 'bntester.dat' which was obtained by capturing real data passed in/out of the 'bn_distsq_line3_pt3' function while running the mged 'ev' command.
