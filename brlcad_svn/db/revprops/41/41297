this fixes an infinite loop that was getting hit when fusing vertices due to some faulty iteration logic.  instead of continuing if they are not equal, which was causing it to stay in the same processing state, check if they are equal so we can fuse and break.  it was stuck endlessly fusing.  affects most NMG and BOT conversion tools and facetize.
