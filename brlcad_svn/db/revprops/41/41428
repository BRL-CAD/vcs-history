add summary count statistics on what percentage and how many objects successfully converted.  this required a reworking of how objects are iterated one line at a time (so objects with spaces in their name are handled correctly) using a here document.  also add a GED parameter so you can specify which mged you want to use instead of whatever is in your path.
