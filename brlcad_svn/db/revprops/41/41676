Move ClientCmd registration and NetMsgRoute registration to their own functions for clarity's sake.  Also, made GSClient a INetMsgHandler and inserted handling functions.  Still seeing a small issue with connection restarts (aka login, logout, login).  The selector loop seems to either stall out or not recognize the newer FD.
