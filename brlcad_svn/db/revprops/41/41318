remove more instances of RT_MAXARGS and MAXARGS. this one is technically a bug that would have been a crasher if the limit were hit as the array was sized as RT_MAXARGS but being iterated over as size MAXARGS (and those two don't actually match each other).  we allocate and free memory dynamically based on the exact size that is needed now.
