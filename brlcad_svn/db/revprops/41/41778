Valgrind squelch - valgrind reporting read error on the dm_list member dml_dmp from function doEvent(). The problem is that the display manager pointer 'dml_dmp' was being free'd from DM_CLOSE() but the parent list element(struct dm_list) was not being dequeued or removed in mged_finish() and would turn up in the event loop after being free'd
