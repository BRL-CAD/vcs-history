it's amazing that 'preview' even works at all given the mess in here.  attempt at undoing the MAXARGS and memory management debacle going on in here.  play it safe and just make our own copies of the strings so we know that it'll be okay to free them all.  get rid of the cmd_storage static as part of that process, mark unused params, and expand the number of command args supported for more complex previews.
