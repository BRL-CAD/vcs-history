add an initial ulp.c implementation to provide a variety of routines useful for comparing numbers.  this is completely preliminary and needs a variety of changes so don't even enable the file for compilation.  for now, it implements ulp() and a variety of run-time variants of the float.h constants ([flt|dbl]_[min|max] and [epsilon|epsilonf]).
