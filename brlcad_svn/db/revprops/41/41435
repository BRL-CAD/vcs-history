add summary of file and object counts along with the failure counts so we don't have to subtract.  also quiet the killing of the timer because of the race condition where it finishes after we get the pid but before the kill.  lastly, specifying ksh was just for testing, not required.  set sh instead, but go ahead and set posix mode too (just because we can).
