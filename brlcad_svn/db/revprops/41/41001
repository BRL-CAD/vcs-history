Convert tkhtml in the cmake branch over to a CMakeLists.txt file.  At the moment this is not a working 'stand-alone' tkhtml build, but it would probably need only the include of the find package tcl call and some graceful conditionals for failing to find it - on gentoo at least it's working amazingly well given how simple the build logic is.
