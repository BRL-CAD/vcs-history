Archer wasn't working with vanilla Itk now present in cmake branch - work around this thanks to Bob Parker by redefining the key class at the startup phase of archer.  Still need to examine changes made to itcl/itk in BRL-CAD, but we'll try to use this approach to make things work with completely vanilla system installs rather than require local itcl/itk builds to run archer.  Very good progress - thanks Bob!  Also use package require tkpng everywhere but windows - need to use it there too but currently can't verify if it works.
