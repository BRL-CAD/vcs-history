Added special wire-frame drawing routines for surfaces who's 3D edges tend to yield a poor graphical representation. These special drawing routines relate to extruded, revolved and closed surfaces and use the surface subdivision tree. To improve performance added a 'depthLimit' parameter to surface subdivision routines for use in wire-frame approximation.
