improve iteration over arguments so that each argument is handled one at a time, leveraging the shell to group arguments with spaces, instead of assuming arguments are space-separated.  The SEARCH option needs spaces for things like SEARCH="-type reg".  also print the current settings during help so you can see what things are set to before you run.
