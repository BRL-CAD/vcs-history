remove all of the forward declarations for bu_opt* (i.e., bu_optind, bu_optarg, bu_opterr, and bu_getopt()) as including these as extern declarations will break the Windows build (missing BU_EXPORT label needed to import the symbol).  the header already declares them, though, so just remove them.  there are probably a lot more of these cases.
