OK, it's becoming increasing clear that the requirements for system testing and config.h generation are going to extend to almost any project being converted from autotools, and that a general approach using one common set of files to be dropped in to each project will be preferable to special-case setups for each project.  Start working out the particulars of that system using Tcl - eventually the intent is to drop this set of files into BRL-CAD, Tk, step, and anywhere else we need them.
