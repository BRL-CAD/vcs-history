Add byacc to the CMake build - it builds, but is not yet used.  Ideally FindYACC should be augmented and this build should be conditionalized on its results.  This is an (extremely) basic CMakeLists.txt file without any of the checks or extra arguments from byacc's aclocal.m4, so curious to see how it will function (particularly on Windows, which is probably where it will be needed the most.)
