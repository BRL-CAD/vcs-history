Bit shifting to get index into fieldlength array having problems when sign bit set. Turned up as an issue with geometry containing large body sizes(large BOT). Since a "byte" is cast to an "int" for the bit operation the sign bit was getting extended into the leading three bytes. To resolve I forced all byte related right bit shifts with the header[] byte array to mask out all but lower byte of 'int' before shifting. In some places the sign bit was already being masked out but wanted to apply generally without knowledge of the defined mask.
