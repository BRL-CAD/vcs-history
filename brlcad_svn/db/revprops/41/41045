remove the 'query' command prompt input tool.  it's a specialized version of 'read' (with defaults) that, while useful for scripting, used SIGALRM and alarm() in its implementation making it non-portable to Windows without maintenance effort.  since it's a burden, not in major use, and has drop-in replacements available, remove it from the package.
