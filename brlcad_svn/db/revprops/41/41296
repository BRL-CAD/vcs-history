Fixed under sized arrays used in reporting intersects in four corner solver. This under size was causing stack corruption issues when a subdivision surface was hit more than twice. Added definition MAX_BREP_SUBDIVISION_INTERSECTS and currently set to 5, four corners and center are currently being tested for possible intersects. The fact that we are getting more than two intersects means that we need to check our near flat criteria for the subdivision but arrays still need to be dimensioned to max possible intersects.
