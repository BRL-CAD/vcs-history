dbopen needs some tlc, particularly on windows due to a change bob make in db_open.c in librt.  we need to keep track of the initial PWD in the dbip.  stashing the full path into dbi_filename is inadequate as we then lose information about how the file was opened (which is important for output, printing, usability)
