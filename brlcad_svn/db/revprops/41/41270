nick fixed a bug on 28AUG2010 in bot_decimate where the bookkeeping in decimate_edge() was missing an edge case while updating the edge list and that sometimes caused the routine to access a freed structure (which caused a bus error).  this fixes an mged crash bug as well as any other decimation routines/tools that called the same librt interface.
