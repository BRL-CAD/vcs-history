Added 'screengrab' command to libged along with hooks for both mged and archer. Added '-o imagename.ext' option to 'preview' command to capture a screen grab of the active graphics window for each frame of an 'rt' script. Modified the 'preview' command to get functioning for common 'rt' frame commands.
