If the static libraries really are .lib files that aren't doing the dll_import/dll_export thing, then it's quite plausible that the static builds were actually overwriting the dynamic .lib linking files, whereas on other platforms the different extension avoids any issue.  Let's try that and enable static libs on WIN32 again.
