No good - need these definitions on Windows too.  Right now, it doesn't look like I can get a space through the CMake output for Visual Studio preprocessor definitions no matter how I quote - have asked the CMake list for help, may need to consider some sort of special purpose config.h file and alter the Tcl/Tk source code.
