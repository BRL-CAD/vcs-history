undo code that is carelessly being too careful.  NMG_CK_HITMISS_LISTS() is a linear walk over the hit and miss lists that was being called all over the place up and down the call stack, often very redundantly.  this is causing certain objects that need to fire rays to evaluate the nmg surface to run absurdly slower (order or more) than they need to.  roll up the NMG_CK_HITMISS_LISTS() calls up the stack to the top caller, still checking before and after to make sure memory is clean, but not during every little recursive processing step.  performance gains uncertain as there are still dominant O() problems elsewhere too.
