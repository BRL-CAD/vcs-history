Massive update.  This takes care of all default compilation warnings
reported on mac 10.4 employing a slew of repairs, modifications, and
restructuring.  More than 100 function declarations were eliminated
because a definition no longer exists.  Other major changes are as
follows:

0) argv are now all consistently arrays of constant strings
1) global editing state and tcl interpreter are universally accessed
   through STATE and INTERP respectively in order to distinguish and
   emphasize the globals.
2) much dead code (unused funcs) eliminated
3) unused parameters are marked
4) exact floating point comparisons now go through NEAR_ZERO(),
   EQUAL() and friends
5) some restructuring to eliminate forward decls
6) fully initialized structures
7) minimal ws consistency (mostly column alignment)
