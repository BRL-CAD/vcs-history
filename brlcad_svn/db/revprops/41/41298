massive deprecation of various mged commands that are being consolidated into a more consistent interface with fewer commands.  NO FUNCTIONALITY IS BEING REMOVED, they are being merged in with other existing commands as options or subcommands so common functionality is grouped together.  this should eliminate approximate 40 top-level commands.  included are the following:  ?lib ?devel dbconcat dbupgrade dbfind dbupgrade debugbu debugdir debuglib debugmem debugnmg comb_std comb_color combmem killall killtree killrefs rotobj arot mrot orot vrot oscale pscale otranslate ptranslate nmg_collapse nmg_fix_normals nmg_simplify bot_condense bot_decimate bot_face_fuse bot_vertex_fuse bot_face_sort bot_smooth erase_all query_ray xpush
