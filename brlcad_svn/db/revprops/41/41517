Updated macro BN_VECT_ARE_PARALLEL in file 'bn.h'.  The macro now can identify parallel vectors pointing in the same direction and in opposite directions. This change should improve the results from the mged commands 'facetize' and 'ev'.  Initial test results look good but still in process of full testing.
