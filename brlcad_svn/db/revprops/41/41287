eliminate lots of calls to MAXARGS (beginning of a process to remove the array constant), replace with a -1 that implies unlimited.  mark the unused maxargs params.  simplify go_edit_redraw_func() to not match the signature of others since it's doing something much simpler and isn't used in the command table.
