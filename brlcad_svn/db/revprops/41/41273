bob fixed a bug people were running into in mged where the various external commands (rt, rtedge, gqa, nirt, etc) were failing to be found if you changed your directory or ran dbopen with a relative path.  mged would invoke 'rt relative/path/to/file.g' and get a file-not-found error if the cwd was not the same as that during dbopen.  problem was masked for files opened with the tcl file dialog because that recorded a full path for dbi_filename.
