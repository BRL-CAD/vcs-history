Made some changes to our surface subdivision routines. Now the first step in our surface subdivision is to divide on the surface knots (subdivideSurfaceByKnots()). The idea here is that major surface directional changes take place at the knots and that the surface behavior between adjacent knots is fairly well behaved. After subdividing at knots we further divide using flatness criteria. Also loosened surface flatness criteria BREP_SURFACE_FLATNESS to 0.80.
