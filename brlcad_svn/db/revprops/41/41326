libbu memory management is not allowed to return NULL (by design) so having bu_realloc() free memory then return NULL for the case where the size is zero but the pointer is non-NULL would be inconsistent with that design.  FORTUNATELY, the standard allows for the return of 'a unique pointer that can be successfully passed to free()' so go ahead and return a new uninitialized minimum-sized allocation.  this is consistent with c99 and IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.
