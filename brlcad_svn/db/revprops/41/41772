Fixed a config issue where a Portal was attempting to search the config system for the incorrect Key.  This was preventing the Portal from knowing what the correct localNodeName was.  Additionally, fixed a small memory leak from a pointer that was being allocated but not deallocated.  Converted to local variable for simplicity.
