Changed function nmg_triangulate_fu to not call nmg_s_split_touchingloops. This function causes increased triangulation failures. The function nmg_triangulate_shell has better success and does not call this function. More investigation is needed but for now leaving out nmg_s_split_touchingloops improves triangulation within the MGED 'ev' command. The MGED facetize command uses nmg_triangulate_shell which has more success than 'ev' performing triangulation.
