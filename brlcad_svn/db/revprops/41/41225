bob fixed a problem with the pro/e export plugin being unable to load on windows.  the problem was that the prodevelop/protk libraries that we have to link against are statically compiled against an old version of the C runtime.  that C runtime wouldn't necessarily match the newer version we compiled against and would cause problems when trying to load the plugin in Pro/E on Windows.  the problem wouldn't manifest if the C runtimes matched or if visual studio was installed.  solution was to add a binding redirect directive in the studio build to make the old symbols in the static lib redirect to a newer runtime.
