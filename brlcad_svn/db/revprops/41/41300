keith fixed a bug in the NURBS raytracing code where it was crashing on a particular surface evaluation.  the ray was grazing a surface and the code was assuming only two hits were possible (in/out) when the surface was flat.  this particular crash case involved three hits causing the fixed-size array bounds to be exceeded.  the fix was to extend the size of the ray for the max possible (i.e., five) given how flat surfaces are presently tested via four corners and a center.
