Made changes to functions bn_isect_line3_line3 and bn_coplanar. Updated most of the tolerances in these functions using values determined by capturing values during test runs and determining where the values converge to 0, 1, -1 etc. These tolerances are not perfect and I believe these values should be computed since they can vary. These tolerance changes appear to improve the results of the mged 'ev' command and 'facetize' command and fewer error messages are reported.
