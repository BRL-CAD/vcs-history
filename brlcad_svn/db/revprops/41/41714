CMake build of NetBSD's m4, the smallest m4 I can find that can bootstrap flex.  Seems to work, will probably need a few more tweaks.  Testing this combination of byacc and m4 triggered a few flex test failures, have emailed byacc dev to see if they are significant.  flex will be a bit more of a challenge.
