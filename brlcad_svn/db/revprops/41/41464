more process trickery so that we can abort the limit timer that kills facetize and reports without the dreaded killed process 'Terminated' messages.  this is achieved by not invoking a subshell, redirecting stderr through a pipe, and killing the sleep children in the same parent shell.  not pretty but gets the job done.  couldn't figure out how to get double-subshell (via shell functions) to work so these have to be in inlined.
