increased the optimized build performance by putting LIKELY/UNLIKELY compiler hints into practice for libbu.  these help the compiler's branch prediction logic for optimized builds for cases where an expression is nearly always true or false.  added to most of the checks that result in a bomb (should be very unlikely) as well as a lot of function entry input sanity tests.

tests before and after are showing a small consistent performance boost of 2-5%
