richard fixed a bug in the point cloud primitive where my "don't bother dequeing" message was apparently a "bad thing" to do.  when freeing the point cloud's bu_list, the forward pointer was being referenced after it was freed (presumably causing a crash or valgrind failure).  fix calls BU_LIST_DEQUE (like I documented in bu.h as being necessary).
