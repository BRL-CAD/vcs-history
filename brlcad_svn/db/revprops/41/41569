Updated the 'conversion.sh' script. Removed the 'conversion time limit exceeded' log messages. When the time limit is exceeded it now shows 'extl' next to either 'bot' or 'nmg' instead of 'fail'. I did this to make is easier to compare between runs of the script, i.e. reading the 'diff' is a little easier. I also changed capitalization of some messages just for consistency and to simplify running 'grep' on the log. I am sure there is a better way to make these changes to the script but it appears to work without problems.
