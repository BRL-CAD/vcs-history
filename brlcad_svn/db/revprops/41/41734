Getting closer on Windows.  Irritatingly, the dlls are being put in bin not lib even after adding the extra config redircts (need to generalize that along these lines:  http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=6926) so all of the pkgIndex.tcl scripts being generated will have to be customized to look for their dlls in ../../bin on Windows."
