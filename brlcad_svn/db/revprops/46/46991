Gah.  Older versions of BRL-CAD are hard-coded to look for oshader in the attributes when importing combs.  This makes the particular label oshader an actual part of the .g file format itself, and NOT writing it out was breaking import of shaders when a .g file is created in a new version of BRL-CAD and subsequently opened in an older version.  Need to check what other hard-coded assumptions got accidently messed with.
