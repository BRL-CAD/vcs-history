The reference manuals will point to the command "edit help" as the authorative list of which subcommands are available. Therefore, only usable commands should be shown. I added the capability to enable/disable commands via the command tab, so that it's a simple matter of setting a flag. rotate and scale are disabled, help and translate are enabled.
