Within file 'nmg_inter.c' updated function 'nmg_isect_two_generic_faces' and disabled functions 'nmg_isect_nearly_coplanar_faces' and 'nmg_isect_coplanar_edges' to quiet compiler errors/warnings because they are no longer used. Simplified the function 'nmg_isect_two_generic_faces' which was possible by using the new function 'nmg_isect_2faceuse'. 

END
