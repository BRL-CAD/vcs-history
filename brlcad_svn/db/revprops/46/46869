add a new IGNORE() macro for use by all of the various macros that turn into 'nothing' if the right compilation flags are set.  for now, go with a simple '(void)param' to quell unused usage warnings but begs testing on msvc2010.  while we're at it, mangle parameters marked as UNUSED() with a prefix so we can catch failings in both directions, catching instances where UNUSED() was erroneously set yet the parameter is actually used.
