Within file 'plane.c' updated functions 'bn_coplanar', 'bn_isect_2planes' and 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3_new'. Corrected a bug in 'bn_coplanar' when computing the distance between planes. Within function 'bn_isect_2planes' changed some floating point compares from zero to SMALL_FASTF and improved the comments. Within 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3_new' fixed a bug when line segments are colinear and the intersection in on the end point(s), the clamping of the exact end point value was not being performed. The changes to function 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3_new' are disabled by default and is a work in progress. The function 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3_new' is a prototype function which supports the prototype version of function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'.
