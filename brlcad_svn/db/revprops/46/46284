hv3 was breaking the line on the first <a> tag it saw, which happened to be in the middle of the synopsis. I added a dummy link around a nonprintable character (to keep docbook from complaining) at the begining of the synopsis, and now everyone is happy. Also, added replaceable tags around the synopsis fragment references and a few other things I'd missed.
