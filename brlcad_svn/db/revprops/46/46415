deprecate db_regexp_match() since it's nearly identical to bu_fnmatch().  it's probably a minimally impacting change that could be removed, but the meaning of the function's boolean return value is flipped making regexp substitution clumsy.  instead, mark it for removal and make the guts call bu_fnmatch().  this was prompted by the existing implementation not supporting an expected feature for 'not' character classes ala [^abc] which  bu_fnmatch does support.
