primitive testing has uncovered off-by-one raytrace errors during identical subsequent invocations of rt due to some floating point issue during parallel processing.  single processor results in zero errors yet parallel gives subtle changes.  should investigate to see if there's a code issue though the problem persists back as far as at least 7.8 (on 64-bit Linux).
