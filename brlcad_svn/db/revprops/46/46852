Changed the way dm-ogl and dm-wgl were handling zclipping (i.e. setting a value in the GL_MODELVIEW matrix). This adversely affected lighting if the window bounds were relatively big and was noticeable when viewing geometry in shaded mode. Added GUI components in Archer to control the front and back zclipping planes.
