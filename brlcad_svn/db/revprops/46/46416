improved globbing of object names in mged by calling the libbu bu_fnmatch() routine instead of the weaker librt db_regexp_match() function.  this was prompted by noticing that support for negated character classes (e.g., [^abc]) was not supported but it should also improve support for other operators such as repetitions of character sets and anchoring to beginning and end of object names.
