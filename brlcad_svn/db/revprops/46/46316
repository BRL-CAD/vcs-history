Stub in a way for view information to be passed to plot routines.  Inactive at the moment, and the struct being passed in just has a single token value - this is setting up the path through which information can be passed, not actually doing it (yet).  This will introduce a binary compatibility, so it may need to be reverted, but I'm committing it at this time to preserve the information for future use; the commit diff is a good starting point when determing what routines in which files will need to be tweaked (obviously if some of them are going to pass anything other than NULL more routines will be altered up the chain).  Eventually level-of-detail wireframes (better spheres, for example, when zoomed in close) will require some form of view information be passed to the plotting routines.
