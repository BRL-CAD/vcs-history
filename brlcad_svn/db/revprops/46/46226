Added a new function 'nmg_isect_2faceuse' to file 'nmg_inter.c' which finds the intersection line between two faceuse. This new function is based on function bn_isect_2planes but can better determine coplanar and parallel faceuse because vertex distances to the faceuse planes are used instead of the angle between the planes and the distance between the planes at their point closest to the origin.

END
