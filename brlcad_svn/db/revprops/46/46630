expose the documented minmum inteface for bu_fnmatch() including the various flags that a caller might set as well as the nomatch return value.  remove the other BU_-prefixed symbols from the implementation since they're not public api.  renamed BU_CASEFOLD to BU_FNMATCH_CASEFOLD in the process for bu api consistency.
