I've been using the "translate" alias to test, so I didn't notice that the calling the edit command directly was recently broken. It was trying to call subcommand functions of the edit help command, which don't exist. Fixed other small problems with the help system. I replaced some 1-off goto's with the code they were redirecting to, to please the Lords of Kobol.
