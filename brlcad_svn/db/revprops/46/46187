there's no need to intentionally make matters any harder for ourselves than they need to be, move the bbox routine to the end so we can reduce the risk of calling the wrong callback and crashing (or worse) if an older library somehow got linked.  also didn't seem to be any particular grouping reason to have it between ifree/describe .. more closely related to prep and params, which the latter is conveniently at the end.
