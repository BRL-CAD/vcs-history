Variety of distcheck fixes, including a nifty problem where a directory named 'off' was causing a logic failure in the path building logic.  dist files are now actual cmake files that are included - this allows CMake to re-run after one is edited, which is the correct behavior.  directories that are specified (as opposed to recognized as parents of files specfied) use svn info to build the list of files below the ignored directory, which means temporary files should be successfully ignored by CPack even when the directory in question is ignored 'in totality' - needs testing.  Need to set up fallback logic for a non-svn based situation, but the core routines are now successful.  dist file contents have been updated to be more complete.
