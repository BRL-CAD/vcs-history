Wrote synopsis for 'edit translate'. It looks fine in brlman, but there is a mysterious line break in the html manual browser, and no line breaks in several places where there should be. First priority is to fix the issue. Failing that, I can simply remove the synopfragment tags (which are what is breaking the formatting) and rearrange things a bit. Added synopsis for 'edit', and cleaned up indentation.
