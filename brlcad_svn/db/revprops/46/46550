Do for other files what we do for .dist - fatal error if we're trying to ignore something that doesn't exist, unless it's a generated file (which will specify itself in a src list with a full path, and thus can be recognized.)  Actually caught a number of bugs in the CMake logic, which are also fixed in this commit.
