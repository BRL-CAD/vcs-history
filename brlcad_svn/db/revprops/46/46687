OK.  First rule if building a dist tarball from a tarball or other non-svn checkout source, don't.  CPack has no way of knowing what to exclude in the fully ignored sub-directories.  If you must, distcheck will do what it can where it can to spot files that don't belong, and warn you of your peril.
