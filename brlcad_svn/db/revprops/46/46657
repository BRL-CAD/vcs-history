wow, the 'e' case has been wrong from the get-go but only now seen with the inadvertent modification of src/external/CMakeLists.txt where it removed the (0) at the end of the file.  this was due to using emacs-style quoting of the () parens instead of perl's unquoted style.  fixed to the original intent of ensuring that text files have a trailing newline.
