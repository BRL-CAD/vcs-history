removed release build-type specific MSVC compiler option
CMake generates per default many configurations for MSVC, e.g. "Debug;Release;MinSizeRel;RelWithDebInfo".  However, the /MD option (use muti-thread DLL C-runtime) is valid for release configurations only.  The debug needs the /MDd option (muti-thread debug DLL C-runtime, for example.  Using the wrong C-runtime may lead to unresolved symbol errors during linking.
Luckily CMake's default MSVC compiler options go well with TCL/TK's needs.  Therefore these are used now.  If one day BRL-CAD's compiler flags setting works for MSVC too it should be just as well.
