Total rework of distcheck.  Not 'hooked up' but it can spot disagreements between build logic and svn info results.  Main problem right now is diffing the two generated text files - CMake is hideously slow at what should be a quick, easy task.  May need to provide minimalist diff utility for this to work acceptably performance wise, but it does appear that it will work.
