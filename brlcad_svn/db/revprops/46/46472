checking order changed.  update docs.  need to check compiler characteristics earlier within cmake so that flags are set properly.  remember there was a specific reason for delaying the compiler testing until after headers/libs/types with the autotools build but don't remember what that reason was any longer (and it's not documented) so go with the flow -- makes more sense to test the compiler flags earlier anyways.
