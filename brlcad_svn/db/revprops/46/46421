tom browder updated the conversion.sh script with new options for KEEP and OPATH, which respectively allow users to keep the working copy and specify the object path to use for searching.  combine two changes together and remove multiline.  (multiline news items are rare, usually reserved for multiple contributors.  also, reworded to fit to column 70.)
