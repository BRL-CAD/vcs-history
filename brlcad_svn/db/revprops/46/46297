Started on description of translate command, and realized that it would be better if the edit page covered the general syntax more in depth, first. This way, subcommands will be easier to digest, and maintain the manuals. I'll still leave the long synopsis in the translate manual, however, to limit having to flip back and forth. The edit synopsis is complete; I'll have to update several key words throughout descriptions in both manuals to refer to the new terms used in the synopsis.

END
