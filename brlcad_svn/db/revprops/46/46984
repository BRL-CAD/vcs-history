the current setting of compiler flags does not work for the MSVC compiler, it results in a broken build
(The CMake standard for MSVC is linking with the C-runtime-DLL, which is OK.  The ridiculous gcc flags force MSVC to use its own standards: Linking every DLL statically with a separate C-runtime.)
