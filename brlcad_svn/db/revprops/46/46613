Take some steps to mitigate the 'relink everything every cmake run' issue.  Use the build types to decide whether we want to increment COUNT - only do so when we're doing a build configuration other than Debug, since it's those cases where we might be concerned how many times CMake has been run.  Also change the way we're getting the timestamp (DATE) in Debug configurations - old method gave the to-the-second ascii string conversion that's standard in C.  For Debug cases, generate our own that only goes down to per-day granularity, so the DATE file doesn't change every CMake run.  These two changes (and some copy_if_different logic for these and other include/conf files) allow a complete cmake re-run without triggering any relinking in Debug mode.
