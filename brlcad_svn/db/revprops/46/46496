Took a stab at using http://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm (WIN32 native curses) to get the terminal code working on Windows, but so far falling way short of success.  The termio_win32.c file doesn't seem to have much in the way of contents, and termio.c doesn't want to build on windows (among other errors, getting illegal indirection errors associated with copyTio).  Even when using termio_win32.c, MSVC doesn't want to generate a .lib file.  The pdcurses demo apps do function, so as far as that goes it does work - just not clear how the BRL-CAD code maps to it.
