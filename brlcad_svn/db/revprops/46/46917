consistently use 0.0005 for a default distance tolerance and 1e-6 for a default perpedicularity tolerance throughout BRL-CAD.  over time, a default of 5e-3 and 5e-4 have been used for the distance tolerance with the latter used in more places; similarly 1e-5 and 1e-6 for perpendicularity.  choosing the more prevalent and tighter bounds for both which constitute a default nearness tolerance of approximately 1/2000ths of 1mm.  that is just under the sqrt of float epsilon, but is easily within double precision.
