Argument type flags were being cleared by mistake. This led to an assert failure when trying to calculate vectors, as there was no argument flagged EDIT_FROM; which should at least defaulted to something. The batch operator is now working, at least in the simple cases that I tried. Also, a variable tracking the number of arguments in a linked list was only incremented by 1 for each batch operator, rather than adding the number of target objects to the total. I didn't observe the effects of this, but it certainly would have broken *something*.
