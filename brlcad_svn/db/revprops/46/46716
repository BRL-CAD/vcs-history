Be more clever about CPack with distcheck and re-generate the config files after we know what to ignore.  Also fixed what could have been a subtle bug where the ignore list for CPack was treating the file entries supplied as patterns. A file called 'test' which was put in the toplevel brlcad source tree to test whether CPack would successfully ignore it resulted in a lot of files being stripped out that should not have been.  Use more plplot wisdom from the CMake lists and convert every entry in the ignore list into a regexp that will match ONLY that file - the ignore logic should now be robust.
