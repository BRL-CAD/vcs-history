Do the simple thing with rt_brep_bbox and call the openNURBS routine - a quick check results in a pretty good bbox, although we'll stick with the bvh result for prep.  The fact that bi->brep is NULL'ed by prep is a bit worrisome, leading to questions about whether this routine will work after raytrace - why are we NUll'ing the bi->brep during prep?
