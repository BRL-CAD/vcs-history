so the big crash is happening due to the surfaces being NULL after a call to Split().  not yet at all clear how that's happening so add debug abort code, return null, and protect against null derefences.  would be cleaner to ensure that subdivideSurfaceByKnots() will never return NULL (and someone (tm) should fix that) but it's not immediately clear to me what the Split() failure means yet.
