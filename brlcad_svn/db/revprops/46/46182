Started logging tests of translate options/args. Ex. of a more complex set of args that is working: "translate -a -x comb/combA 3 -z combB/combC 0 0 11 -y combD/combE 0 7 combF/combG", which moves the instance of combG in combF from it's bounding box center to (x= apparent bb ctr of comb/combA offset 3 units), (y= apparent bb ctr of combF/combG offset 7 units), (z= apparent bb ctr of combB/combC offset 11 units). Disable use of batch operator as an argument to -x/-y/-z; for now. It's a bit of work to get that going. More statements needing parenthesis.
