Make a serious stab at incrementing the COUNT variable only when the configuration actually changes.  For the moment, this is accomplished by reading the old CMakeCache.txt file (stashed at the beginning of the second cmake run) and comparing values found there to values in the current CMake enviornment.  It's not perfect in that new variables in the working environment won't trigger the COUNT increase, but for most reconfiguration situations something will be changed and trigger COUNT so this may be workable.  Cache diffing routine needs more hammering.  Various tweaks to the CMake logic to try and keep things consistent between runs.
