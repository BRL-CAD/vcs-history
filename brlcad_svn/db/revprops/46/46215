Testing "translate -k -x 3 -a -y 5 shp" revealed that the default "to" points (ex: x/z of -a) were being set to shp's bb-ctr, rather than the kp specified with -k (which in turn defaults points to the bb-ctr of shp). That cmd should move the bb-ctr of shp to y=5 and not change its x/z pos (the -k part is superflous). It was moving the y-axis, but was also moving on the x-axis an amount equal to the difference between the bb ctr of shp and x=3.
