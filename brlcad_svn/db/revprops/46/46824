add an initial implementation of a BRL-CAD exporter for the DOT plain text graph description language.  This exporter outputs the CSG DAG for a given set of objects with color coding based on the node type (presently only recognizing non-region combinations, regions, and primitives).  works like a charm on a .g file and unlike the other exporters, will default to all top-level objects if none are specified (a concept that should be extended to all our exporters).  DOT files can be rendered to an image using a variety of programs such as Graphviz, Tulip, and OmniGraffle.  [approx 4 hrs to write]
