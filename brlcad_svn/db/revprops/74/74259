Ah, that's why poly2tri was unhappy - wasn't correctly yanking points too close to existing vertices in projections - resulted in points very close to verts, which crossed the 'no-good' threshold for the poly2tri algorithm.  As a byproduct, can clearly see now by real examples why we do need full CDT - the quick-and-dirty tricks with the plain DT won't work reliably.
