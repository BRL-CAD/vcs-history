greatly simplify and fix a long-standing problem printing matrices during struct parse errors, logging, and diagnostic output.  all printing goes through just one routine now instead of the 4x duplication too.  bu_num does a much better job, but needs api for string printing in order to support parse output here.  this consequently also fixes ebm parse error printing where newlines were getting injected and indentation was wrong resulting in hard to read messy output.
