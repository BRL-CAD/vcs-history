Looks like github is wanting emails after all (per Sean) so we'll need to do this after all.  Putting back specifically set email - Sean is working on an approch and when we have a way forward we'll adjust all the map entries.  This will require a full re-run of the commit process (and manual updating of the sync merges) so we only want to do it once.
