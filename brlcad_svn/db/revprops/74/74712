Start setting up to pass down an overlap threshold length.  For now basing it on bbox size, but the user should be able to supply a fixed size.  Drawback will be that small length + large model will produce an explosion of triangles and easily get into nonresponsive territory, so ideally we should cap at some sane ratio...
