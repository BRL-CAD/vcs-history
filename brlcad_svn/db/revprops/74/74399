Use Gregory Pakosz's whereami wrapper file to replace the deprecated bu_argv0_full_path function for internal brlcad_root resolution of directories in bu_dir.  For this to work reliably bu_getiwd isn't enough - if we launch in a directory that doeesn't happen to give use the right seed path, we still won't find anything.  whereami attempts to encapsulate the platform specific logic necessary to make this work.  Using this setup, bu_dir bin works in testing on Linux regardless of current working dir or initial working dir.  It even works if we put the build/bin dir into the shell's path and launch with no path info at all in the executable invocation.
