We're probably not ready for all-up pix diffing on NURBS images for regression, but there is something else we can do.  Specific shots can be identified as unambiguous hits or misses based on visual inspection of the shapes - adding a lower level call to the nirt logic in libanalyze, we can detect when those specific shots are hitting or missing incorrectly.  The nirt API is probably much too heavy for this, but it's I/O logic was already specifically set up to read in floating point strings at high fidelity for a similiar situation where we needed to exactly reproduce rays from string inputs.  The example added is a case in NIST3 that illustrates an unexpected hit with the current trunk logic.  The comparison is currently deliberately simple and binary, without attempting to assess the correctness of hit points or partitions.
