This undoubtedly broke a bunch of stuff, but refactor to pull the refinement point and edge point logic out of the triangle intersection code.  Had some notions about performance optimization, but at this stage the confusion aspect is dominating even if there might be some performance to be had at some point.  Looking like more awareness of vert/edge status is needed up front, and attempting that while tangling everything even further just isn't going to work.
