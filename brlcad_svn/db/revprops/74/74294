At the failure point, explicitly test for the bbox reported during successful validation of the vtree corresponding to the point we should be close to.  That is found, but the candidate isn't, and at least visually they both seem to be centered around the point - only difference is the box around the point not succeeding in the search is somewhat smaller.  Trying to narrow in on the cause of failure...
