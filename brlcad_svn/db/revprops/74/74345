Iterate on the steps until each category of refinement isn't changing the meshes.  The final category of overlap looks like it is going to need a particular shared retriangulation to assemble a non-interfering triangle set - successive refinements (at least simple edge splitting) isn't really guaranteed to clear the problem and can introduce a lot of unnecessary triangles in the process.
