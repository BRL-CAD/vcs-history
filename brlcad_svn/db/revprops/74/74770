add support for structparsing zero-values and protection against printing nul chars into strings (thus truncating them).  instead of nul, we write out empty string which parses back as a nul-terminated 0-length string.  also utilized bu_vls_printf() in places where the code was manually calculating lengths and appending to strings for greater clarity and robustness.
