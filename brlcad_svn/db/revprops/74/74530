Start working on hooking Appleseed into the build.  This is looking to be a chore - the dependency stack for Appleseed is huge, which means defining a bootstrap is going to be involved, and I'm hitting various compile issues trying (the default 2.1.0 source build doesn't work on latest Ubuntu, for example.)  The binary runs in isolation, but I'm having trouble linking the library into the art executable - boost_system library apparently needs to be linked into art, and even when I try that the openimageio linking happy for some reason...
