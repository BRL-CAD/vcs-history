Print more information.  If I recall correctly there are provisions for duplicate points around closed areas as a way to handle the initial breakdown of loops, but it looks like various parts of the code aren't agreeing on which of those duplicates to use and consequently we're not getting a canonical lookup.  Will have to look into it in more detail.
