Adjust the edge tolerances for edge-only intersections.  In principle we may not be able to reliably ignore all edge intersections - if a mesh has an intruding 'pyramid' shape where all mesh edges align but there is still an intruding interior point at the peak of the pyramid this might end up missing that - but the first cut at a test for that case is overcounting intersections and needs more investigation.
