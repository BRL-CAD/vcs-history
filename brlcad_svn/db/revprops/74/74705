Stash what seems to be an odd ray/tri miss using the libbg routine - need to revisit later.  Found walking down a set of intersections trying to figure out why a ray-based test of inside/outside disagreed with the winding number based answer - expected an even number of triangles, got an odd number, and visually this triangle looks like it should be a hit but isn't??  Need to confirm this isn't an error on my part somehow.
