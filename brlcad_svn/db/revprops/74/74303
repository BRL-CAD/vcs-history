the iges regression was actually doing a bunch of work, ignoring it all, and only failing if the singular m35 region tested at the end failed. fixed the STATUS propagation so now all issues are detected and reported correctly.  alas, this means they cannot be turned on because there are problems that need to be fixed -- they are currently commented out with FIXME notes.
