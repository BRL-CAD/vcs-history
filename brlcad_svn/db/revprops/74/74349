Working with the triangle info to see how we need to filter things to get the necessary input sets - may do better working with the intruding triangle list and skipping the alignment logic based on what I'm seeing - the plots using intruding triangles correspond pretty well to what rtcheck spots, at least when the triangles come in pairs.
