Proof of concept generic debug command that uses a program to generate a list of active debug variables in the style of the env command.  Reports available variables overall or per library, which onces are active, and provides a way to toggle them.  Probably needs usability work and should support 0x000 style specifications as well, but in principle this should replace all of the debug* commands.
