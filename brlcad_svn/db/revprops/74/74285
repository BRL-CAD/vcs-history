Pull the authors emails into the maps (unless we have newer information already from users) and get all three versions in sync.  Editing cvs_authormap manually was a mistake - "cat account-map | sed 's/ / = /' > cvs_authormap" should do the trick.  Not sure yet how to unambiguously identify github accounts for users - there are enough registered github users at this point that names by themselves won't be reliable.
