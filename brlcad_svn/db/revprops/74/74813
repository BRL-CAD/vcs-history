Ouch.  r74458 incorrectly simplified the KODDHIT ifdefs/ifndefs when putting the solid shotlining code back in, and the 'solid' hits were always reporting zero length segments.  Deceptive in image generation since the first hit point and normal were correct, but there was no solid segment behind the first hit for reporting solid segments.
