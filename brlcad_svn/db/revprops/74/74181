Filter inside/outside on both faces in the interaction pair, not just one, and visualize the p_mvert points to be considered for triangle splitting.  Can see visually we need to filter cases when the closest_surf_pnt is already an existing vertex, and we definitely need to handle situations where the new closest point is sitting on the edge between two triangles.
