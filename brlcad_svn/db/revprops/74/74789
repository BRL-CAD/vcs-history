Move the trim closest point search down into opennurbs_ext.  Need something faster - this is expensive as it stands - but not quite sure how to adapt the closest point on curve logic for this.  We're walking a curve whose t paramater evaluates to a 2D point in the parametric space, but what we care about optimizing is in 3D space.
