With some help/guidance from Sean, generalize the zlib prefix definition mechanism to allow specification o something other than the default z_ prefix.  This is setting the stage for other changes that will in combination allow us to bundle our own zlib without any risk of conflict with system or other third party libraries.  Ideally we'll push as many of these changes upstream as we can, but this is not an ability built into the current zlib ecosystem so we'll probably have to maintain 3rd party patches to use it properly.  However, given the number of compatibility issues we've hit inadvertantly mixing system and bundled zlib and libpng (Mac OSX is especially bad in this respect) it's probably still worth doing.
