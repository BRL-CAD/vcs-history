Detect valid single trim edges with trim type boundary and flag them as plate mode.  Replace #define with if test.  Hopefully this will do the plate mode enabled raytracing only when we have an object that isn't solid, since having plate mode always on seems to cause problems with NIST3 at a minimum...
