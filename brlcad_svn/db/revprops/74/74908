Proof of principle level implementation of an ability to identify based on a ray/line the closest edge curve to that line.  Similar to nirt's ability to report what's along the shotline, but this uses bounding boxes around curves in an RTree and subsequent closest distance between line and curve calculations instead of ray intersection.  Returns the edge id, which can then be viewed and introspected with the plot and info subcommands.  Not completely sure the ClosestPointToLineSegment algorithm/implementation are what they should be, but visual inspection suggests it is functioning well enough to return useful results for this purpose.
