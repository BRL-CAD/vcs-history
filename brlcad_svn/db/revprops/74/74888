implement a basic adjustment for platemode to clamp the thickness to within a platemode thickness distance from the surface.  this is not final form, but is working surprisingly as intended.   using an overly simple and inefficient stepping method to walk the los thickness back; needs newton's method or more aggressive stepping.
