There we go.  Thanks to Sean for the pointer - integrate the helloworld example from Appleseed so the art application does something to exercise the renderer.  Needs https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/blob/master/sandbox/examples/cpp/helloworld/data/scene.obj present to run, but does generate the output image.  This should be a reasonable starting point for exploring BRL-CAD/Appleseed integration.
