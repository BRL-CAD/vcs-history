May be overkill doing it this way, but try adding a point into a mesh that has triangles close to a newly split brep edge curve.  Idea is we want all the meshes to line up in terms of their vertices where they might interfere, and while a new edge vert may not intrude into the other mesh associated triangles using that vert might.  The proposed method of correcting those situations needs aligned vertices, so try to make sure we will have them.  Untested.
