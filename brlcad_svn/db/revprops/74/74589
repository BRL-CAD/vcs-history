Putting in a secondary testing function for now since I'm not 100% sure of this, but it looks as though the coplanar tri-tri test is doing an insufficient check for whether triangles are fully contained and is returning a false positive for contained in the edge intersection case...  I could see it if the area test picked up on the super-thin sliver of the edge, but what seems to be happening is the single point-in-triangle test checking for triangle-in-triangle is insufficient - one or two of the edge points might report marginally inside, but manifestly neither of the triangles is inside the other so per the source comment that portion of the test shouldn't be returning true, unless I'm missing something.
