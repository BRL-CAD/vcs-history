Address a couple issues that resulted in invalid meshes.  One was obvious in retrospect - a surface point has no context by itself to make a sane bounding box, so it has to come from its parent overt.  The other is a little more worrisome - getting failing RTree searches for vertex lookup unless we do a full tree rebuild after the vertex insertion.  My understanding is that we shouldn't have to do this, but unwinding what's going on is going to need a pretty deep dive into the RTree.h code.  In the meantime, just rebuild the tree so we can do other testing...
