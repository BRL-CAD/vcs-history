Leverage the openNURBS SubBrep and Append capabilities to implement a split subcommand for the brep command.  The purpose here is to take a solid BRep object and produce from its faces a set of plate mode NURBS objects.  This provides a mechanism for 'converting' to plate mode from solid, but without having to implement any sort of flag - the underlying BRep data types are in fact representing plate mode objects when written back to the .g file.  Two modes - one puts the specified set of faces (all by default) into a single multi-plate BRep object, and the other produces a comb unioning one-brep-per-face plate mode BRep objects.  The advantage of the latter is an ability to individually inspect and remove specific faces.
