Plot the edges and faces.  The visual pattern is clear - the invalidity is related to the closed surface edges.  The 3d->2d mappings there are not unique, so we'll have to think about how to handle it in a useful fashion.  The audit function looks like it is wrong in that it's not happy when it gets two triangles on a single face on a closed edge, which is right, but we clearly have a lookup failure on a triangle with one edge vert using a vertex from the closed surface edge, which needs to work.
