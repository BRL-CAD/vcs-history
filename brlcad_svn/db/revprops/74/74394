Make the libanalyze version of NIRT's debugging command work using the same mechanism as the new libged debug command.  Only difference is nirt's doesn't expose liboptical debugging, and does expose libanalyze debugging (the latter should probably be turned on in libged as well, but libanalyze doesn't link in liboptical so we need to avoid it here.)
