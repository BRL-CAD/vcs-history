More work to do (info and plot need help messages and restructuring, not sure if selection is still working) but close enough to swap in the new brep command code.  Allows for the removal of brep_debug.cpp - aside from rt_brep_boolean it looks like the messy bits of the brep command reaching into the internals of librt should now be gone.
