While working on the edge miss tolerance piece, stumbled across another issue.  With brep objects using liner trims on planar faces, we aren't getting closure from near hit/near miss logic and cracks are appearing along these seams.  My guess right now is that such cases simply aren't ever getting to the near hit/miss intersection logic (possibly tight bounding boxes are culling rays before an intersect is tried, or some other test is concluding no-hit before we get there?) This will probably need a fix in the raytracing logic, but in the meantime checkpoint a validation routine that seems to generate identifications corresponding to the offending edges (at least, it flags the edge that triggered the initial issue and checking a couple others so identified reveals similiar problems on close raytracing zooms.)  This should come out (or at least the tolerance should be increased) once we can handle the issue.
