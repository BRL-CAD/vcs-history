Replace the custom libbg ear clipping implementation with the version from https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp.  Seems to have better behavior, and (although I want to test this before updating the header docs) may eliminate the need for the caller to make sure of the polygon ordering in the input data set before calling bg_polygon_triangulate.  Sean mentioned the nmg_triangulate_fu function, which is also something to look at, but currently we're not using any libnmg data structures in libbg and I'd prefer not to add that cognative and debugging overhead right now...
