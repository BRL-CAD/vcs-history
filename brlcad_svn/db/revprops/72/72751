I think this is what is intended here?  We don't every shrink the capacity of the all_mapped_files container, so we don't free entries in the mapped_files array - instead, we keep the 'active' items at the head of the array, clear the memory of the no-longer-in-use entry, and swap it in at the end.  The current state of the rt_cache tests passes with this change - I'm able to do another rtip preparations after an rtip is freed.
