We were already using pipe and rt_do_cmd to set some of the information for the raytrace from libged.  Add a few new rt_cmdtab commands and manage the list of active objects so we can stream in and grow a list of objects via the pipe, then trigger the prep step after we're done streaming them in.  This should avoid crazy long command lines with large object lists (only implemented for rt currently, and not yet tested with Windows.  Once proven to work, need to go back and get rtcheck and saveview as well.)  Need to make sure this doesn't subtly break something, since the cmd_tree function was also changed. The non-cmd path shouldn't be impacted, but also need to double check that...
