Putting the density info in the ged struct was a bad idea - gqa's code is the only beneficiary, and that's going to be moot anyway once we do a badly needed refactor of that code to actually pass info around instead of using a global ged pointer (urk... must fix...)  We always read it at run time anyway, so there's no point in stashing it in memory.
