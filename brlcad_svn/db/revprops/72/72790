This is not ideal in that it is limited to launching ncpus processes, but at least in principle it demonstrates a multi-process test of the cache.  Even the small CPU counts expose a failure condition where the format file is not found when the directory exists, but in real use that condition is probably rare enough not to worry about so it's questionable whether these last tests should be hooked up...
