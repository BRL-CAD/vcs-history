It looks like back in commit r48351 there was a specific Coverity cid report for a TOCTOU issue that prompted the use of fd in bu_file_delete.  (That was when the initial opening of the fd was introduced, which is also most likely when Windows file deletion was broken.)  Rework bu_file_delete to preserve the r48351 behavior on non-Windows platforms.
