Checkpoint some notes... Seeing what appears to be a grazing hit behavior along a cone surface that is return a large number of similar hits, and the result is confusion in the near_hit/near_miss resolver.  From the ray perspective they resemble hits near an edge crack, but they aren't really what we had in mind for that...
