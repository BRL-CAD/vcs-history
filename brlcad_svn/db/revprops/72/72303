Prototype a GED process command for listing and terminating subprocesses - essentially a generalization of rtabort.  Not announcing as a new command yet (needs to be set up to work with commands other than just rt for this to actually be useful... - right now rtcheck (for example) doesn't register itself on the subprocess list, so only rt commands show up or can be terminated)
