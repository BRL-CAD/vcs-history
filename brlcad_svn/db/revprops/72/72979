This case arose in a triangulation problem from the nurbs->bot work on one of the NIST test cases.  It's a polygon with 4 points, but three are colinear due to coming from an edge.  We need to triangulate this such that we gt the two triangles which incorporate all 4 points, but so far both poly2tri and libbg's ear clipping don't like it.
