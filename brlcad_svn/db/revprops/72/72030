start trying a lot harder to get the current name of the running application, so we can figure out the running executable name without having to run bu_setprogname().  included implementations for mac, windows, and bsd for starters.  logic needs to move/consolidate as bu_argv0_full_path() is deprecated, but this fixed the immediate issue of gdb/debugger needing to know argv[0].
