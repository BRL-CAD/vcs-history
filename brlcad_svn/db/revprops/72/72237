rename and move admin-db from src/util to src/gtools as 'gex'.  the name implies exploring geometry and is a nod to the low-level old ex unix editing tool, this being a low-level geometry inspection tool.  tom did some really nice work here, very useful, useful enough to install and have on hand for inspecting geometry files.
