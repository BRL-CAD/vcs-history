looks like a lot of the reasoning for at least some of the custom function tests may no longer be needed now that BRLCAD_FUNCTION_EXISTS checks both existence and declaration.  case in point, program_invocation_name is correctly detecting as available but not declared in strict posix mode, so we can ditch the old test (whose _GNU_SOURCE override made it out of sync with how we compile).
