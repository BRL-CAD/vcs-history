beefed up the test with a bit of content validation.  now makes sure something was written.  extending the tests with support for writing to an in-memory FILE* exposes a limitation in the interaction between bu_backtrace() and its backtrace() guts.  fmemopen FILE pointers don't have an associated file descriptor, so data needs to be passed back instead of relying on file-based IPC.
