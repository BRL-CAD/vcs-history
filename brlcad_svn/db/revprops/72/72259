Getting a situation with Rt control panel in MGED on Windows where stdin isn't immediately processed by rt - the rt command is waiting to run it's rt_do_cmd loop until fb_open hears back from MGED, but that doesn't happen until the libged rt command is fully run and MGED's callback functions are triggered from the main loop.  Consequently, the stdin pipe currently has to hold the entire command list and if the draw list is long enough that appears to cause problems.  Try moving the fb_open call and associated logic to the point just before we start actually doing rendering in rt, so we don't block on fb_open any sooner than we have to.  This may not be ideal (indeed the coupling of the invocation to specific rt command strings as triggers definitely isn't ideal) but hopefully it will also address the immediate problem while being minimally invasive.
