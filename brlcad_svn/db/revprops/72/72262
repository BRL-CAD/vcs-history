don't dercs stepcode paths - will break the build due to the md5 verification.  Should probably update the stepcode check to use something like https://github.com/hkuno9000/cpp-decomment to preprocess the inputs so we aren't sensitive to changes in comments... from a stepcode build standpoint the only real problem is cached perplex outputs with different execution logic
