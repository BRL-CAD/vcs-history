This is a dangerous change, and will need extensive testing, but getting a case where the near miss resolving logic is ending up with a single near-miss point surviving in the middle of the hit points along a ray.  Need to get a better sense of why this is happening, but an immediately obvious thing to do is be more agressive about stripping out a NM point when we have an odd point count.  I suspect there are other dragons lurking here - this may be part of the problem we sometimes have with odd results along grazing tangent rays, for example - and we may need something more generally sophisticated here that factors in matters such as angles between hit normals and ray directions when voting which points to keep or ignore.
