rewrite cache management structure so cache objects are spread out across individual files.  this avoids an expensive dirbuild when cache grows large, avoids creating huge files that provoke I/O activity, and provides O(1) lookup complexity for any given object.  this may support concurrent parallel access, but not yet tested.  cache structure version bumped from 0 to 1, object versioning remains at 0.
