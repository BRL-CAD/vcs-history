bzzt, while technically true, r72045 is not adequate. the sys/sysctl.h header needs the old unsigned types which don't get typedef'd if we're compiling against a standard.  unfortunately, the header is not robust to strict compilation on bsd systems.  since this is a recurring issue, test if the unsigned types are available with whatever the current compilation settings are.
