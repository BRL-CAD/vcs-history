prep caching v2.

intended to address a potential race condition where multiple threads
ended up writing out to their own dbip handles simultaneously with
badness ensuing.  now it works on a copy and moves into place
atomically when it's ready.

as v1 potentially wrote out corrupt cache objects, particularly on
windows, went ahead and bumped the version number. also implemented
the necessary logic to "upgrade" an existing cache by wiping it out
(i.e., delete all the things).

work in progress, of course.  needs testing.  needs refactoring.
still need to add the bits for windows atomic move since there's no
rename() there too; but fortunately there is a function for it.
