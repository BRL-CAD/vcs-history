Checkpoint an experiment - this cuts db_open and bu_mapped_file out of the cache logic.  Instead, we deal directly with low level bu_external serializations.  So far (at least on Linux) haven't seen the odd invalid bu_free reporting of db_open based logic, but needs a lot more stress testing (not to mention Windows) to convince that this is any sort of improvement.  Note in passing that a naive addition of bu_mapped_file usage to cache_read_external doesn't seem to work - get some kind of memory corruption, but not confident yet that those issues are anything other than a consequence of some error on my part...
