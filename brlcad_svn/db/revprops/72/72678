Ah.  The bu_file_exists call at the beginning of the delete logic with a non-null fd was resulting in Windows considering the file in-use, and consequently refusing to delete it.  Narrow the scope of the open fd in the delete logic.  While we're at it, having already waded through it, we might as well use the Windows file APIs on that platform.
