The pipe communication approach seems to do fairly well - not sure yet, but it may be pretty straightforward to set up a convention to have bu_process_exec optionally establish more pipes at launch time that applications could then coordinate use of.  Immediate goal is to allow a vlist drawing information pipe that we can use instead of having to swipe one of stdout or stderr (which would leave them free for their intended original purposes.)  Will need to do some exploring/experimentation
