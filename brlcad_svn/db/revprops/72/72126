Had a report of autogenerated rt commands with long object lists exceeding the command line argument limits on Windows.  Switch libged's rt running command to using a temp file listing the objects by default, and falling back to the previous mechanism if a temp file cannot be obtained.  In the latter case, check the command line length against the system limit, if known, and error out if it is too long.
