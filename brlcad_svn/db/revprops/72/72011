Need two things to make PROJ-4 work from the build directory (or other non-install locations).  First, need to manage the dictionary files used for definitions so that they are visible in the build dir hierarchy.  Since, need to hook into the PROJ_LIB environment variable to tell PROJ-4 where it needs to be looking.
