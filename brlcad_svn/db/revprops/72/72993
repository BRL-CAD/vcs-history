include a general mechanism for defining a function that will get run when a library is loaded.  uses static struct constructor for C++, an msvc declspec+pragma for msvc to put the function in the .init section (.CRT), or gcc/llvm constructor attribute elsewhere.  these cause a function declared via the macro to run before main() is invoked, so extreme caution will be needed to not abuse this capability.
