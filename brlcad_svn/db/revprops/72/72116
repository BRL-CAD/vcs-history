Proof-of-principle implementation of an 'env' command.  Combines a configure/build time pass over the source files looking for all non-other-non-tools instances of getenv that use a static string, and uses those results to inform the env command what the relevant environment variables are for BRL-CAD's sources.  Allows (for example) the LIBRT_BOT_MINTIE variable to be discoverable (in principle) by users, and automatically addes/removes environment variables to env without requiring manual maintenance of an 'active' list (given a clean build - at least right now the env var list generation command doesn't depend on all other BRL-CAD source files in the repo so it doesn't auto-rebuild in response to edits.  That would probably be possible in principle but may not be worth the trouble.)  Categorizing and grouping based on naming patterns/conventions would undoubtedly be a good idea.
