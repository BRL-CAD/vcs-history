The DEM test isn't ready to be hooked in yet.  Two issues have cropped up - one is that the test is too sensitive (should only be checking object data, not whole .g file).  More difficult technically is that it looks like GDAL is not picking up our local copy of PROJ4 correctly, even with PROJ_STATIC set.  Confusingly, the conversion will still succeed, but the attributes end up different depending on whether PROJ4 is installed in the final BRL-CAD install directory (where GDAL can find it) or not yet installed (in which case it looks like it is falling back on some internal default rather than finding the libproj in the build directory).  Not sure yet what rewiring will be needed to get this to actually work the same way consistently.
