Have svn2git write out its .gitignore files if it thinks a revision has them - will try to use these for svn prop-only update commits - this way, we don't have to write our own parser.  Don't look much like the cvs .gitignore files, so I'm not really sure how accurate these are, but probably good enough - once we switch to git we can customize it going forward.
