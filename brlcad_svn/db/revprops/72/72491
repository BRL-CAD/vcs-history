Ah - Archer uses rtwizard, and rtwizard was registering itself as an rt command.  Therefore, rtabort would take out both rt and rtwizard commands.  Have rtabort take out rt, rtwizard, and rtcheck (once kill is repurposed to process kill instead of geometry kill, we can look at deprecating rtabort completely, so until then we'll just have it do what is expected.)
