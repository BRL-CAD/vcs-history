Checkpoint early thoughts about what a gqa/rtcheck/rtweight replacement command would look like, designing with an eye towards support for any/all of batch mode, interactive command use and pipe driven subprocess control.  Not much here yet - basically just trying to boil down rt's command mode (currently our most sophisticated example of controlled subprocess command usage) to a bare bones template for general libged-subprocess-ready executables.
