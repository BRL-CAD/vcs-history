preliminary bu_glob() function for general globbing support patterned after the bsd glob(3) function.  bu's purpose is to ensure that the globbing method via function callbacks is supported on all platforms, even where glob() or the alt_dir extension are not supported.  initial stub is the easy path for mac/bsd/linux so it shall remain disabled until windows is supported.
