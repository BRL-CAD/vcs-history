even re-implementing bu_file_realpath() using canonicalize_file_name() or a null second arg appears to still have a memory overrun errors getting detected on linux.  reading up, the function is just horribly broken for various versions prior to libc-5.4.13;  restore bu_file_realpath() commented since it's still worth fixing to sanitize our env variable string.
