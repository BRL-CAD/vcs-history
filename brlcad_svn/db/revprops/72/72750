I think we need to zero out the struct here, not set it to NULL - this is a full-on container, not a pointer to one.  We're not decreasing the capacity of the all_mapped_files array, just the size.  If we want to come back around after closing everything out and reuse the mapped_file setup again, we need this storage to be present and initialized to zero (just as it was originally - see mappedfile.c:280) to avoid a segfault as the mapfile_add logic tries to copy the incoming struct to a null memory address.
