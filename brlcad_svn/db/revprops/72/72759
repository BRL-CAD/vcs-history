revert c72751, that's not what was going on here.  it's a simple array of pointers EXCEPT for the first ones that are statically allocated.  revisiting the cleanup code, however, it's clear now that this code isn't going to clean up dynamic allocations correctly due to how the statics are getting skipped.  needs work.
