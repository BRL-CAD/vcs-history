Quick and dirty C++ to do mapping between svn commits and git commits pre 29887 based on commit messages and timestamps.  Just over a thousand don't map due to non-uniqueness, and over a hundred don't map at all (quite a few cvs2svn generated commits in the latter, it looks like...) but on the whole a surprisingly good result.  The successful mappings will directly feed note commits to the cvs2git repo to match up SVN revision numbers to git commits, and the failed commits are listed for inspection.
