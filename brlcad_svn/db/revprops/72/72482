Add analyze logic to detect situations where we have a copyfrom_path at a revision that is older than the last edited state (what in a git export would be the current state.)  If this is correct there are a number of such cases, including r64060 which looks like Bob making the eab branch from an older state of trunk.  Correctly spots 33147 as a problem.
