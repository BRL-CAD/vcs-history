address a slew of compilation errors on mac now that log formatting is strict for all builds.  predominantly means using %j and casting off_t's to intmax_t since the prior does not have a format specifier defined and we need a large signed type to be compatible.  also changed ptbl to using size_t for the 'end' field since it's really the number of elements stored and is never negative.
