increase the timeout to 5 minutes until we can get a better handle on what's taking so long on one of our CI hosts.  some of our tests are undoubtedly close to 60, which is probably pushing them >100 on a busy system periodically.  not helpful CI if we get false negatives though, so practical wins.
