Implement a pretty-print function for column printing of numbers.

This new function takes an array of doubles and formats them into neat
tabular form with aligned columns.  Included in BU instead of BN as it
pertains more to printing and presentation than numbers.  The idea is
for BN (and any other libs) to use this function with specified
parameters for consistent printing of their numeric types.

This is already flexible enough to be fully compatible with nearly all
existing matrix/vector/point print functions (there are numerous) and
by default will print with superior precision, minimal padding, and
caller-specified decoration.  That said, the specific function name,
group, and params are subject to change as remaining generality gets
implemented.  Still working on buffer printing, an option to
decimal-align, and will need to update the world incrementally.
