heavily rework how backtracings are managed via signals to decrease chances that the routine will get stalled out waiting on a child.  we weren't properly waiting for the children too, which was resulting in zombies.  also, add support for lldb as a debugger in addition to gdb.  this gets the backtrace working again on Mac OS X which no longer provides gdb.
