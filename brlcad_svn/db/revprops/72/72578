It's looking more and more like we'll need to find a way on a rolling basis to associate revision numbers with commit sha1 strings.  r36053 branches from an older trunk rev, and preliminiary experiments with git notes for revision number recording seem to indicate they need sha1 strings and not just marks in the fast import.  This probably means dumping the fast import per revision, importing it into the git repo, reading back in the commit sha1 from git, and replacing all current uses of revision number marks with lookups to the rev->sha1 map (at a minimum.)
