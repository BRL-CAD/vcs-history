working with tim yesterday, couldn't find a simple exporter that preserved color.  found ply is fully broken.  obj added usemtl lines but only wrote black.  related to the attribute syncing issue, note that command processing in general also needs to be looked at as it's gotten slower even without regions/attributes.
