Reframe - bu_file_delete was used by GED commands edmater, edcodes, red, put_comb and the MGED tedit command, plus a number of tools like tire, burst and coil.  Any operation in those commands that needed to remove a file would have hit the bu_file_delete problem on Windows, which probably wouldn't hault the command operation but would leave stray temporary files behind.
