Fix two issues with bu_dir.  1.  Make the return buffer be a pointer to a read only static MAXPATHLEN buffer if the user didn't supply a buffer, per the bu/app.h comments.  2. Make the lookup values for relative paths values from the configure-time variables, rather than hardcoded strings.  This means the bu_dir lookup logic will now reflect any overrids to bin, lib, etc. directory locations.
