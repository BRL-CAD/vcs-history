oh noes! do not close the dbip we were just checking on! this resulted in a db_close() error when the cache gets destructed as the hash continued to hold a pointer to the closed dbip for later.  we got into this situation when two threads or procs attempted to cache the same object at the same time, and likely introduced when the cache code was refactored to use rename semantics.  traded a race for bad book-keeping, but now in better working order.  tested with massive collisions, random cache deletions (live and otherwise), and inconsistent access permissions.
