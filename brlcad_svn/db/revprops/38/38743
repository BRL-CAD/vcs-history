some comments from tom browder on the brlcad-devel mailing list gave me an idea to quell src/other compilation.  as we've had to repeatedly explain that we don't care about src/other and general confusion that src/other issues are brl-cad issues, this should go well towards avoiding misconception.  check for the -w gcc flag that disables all warnings and provide NOWARN to Makefile.am files.  moreover, if --disable-warnings is actually requested, turn off everything.
