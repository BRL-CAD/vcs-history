First stab at cleaning up the logic for calling editors.  Use bu_which to get paths for editors in Unix style environments, and remove the compile-time conditional flags.  Instead, ask Tcl what operating system we're on, and use that information combined with the results of the editor setup to determine whether we need a controlling terminal.  Needs testing.
