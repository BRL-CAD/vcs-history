Merge in tkpng 0.9 to replace tkimg - unlike last time, just duplicate the tkimg approach already present and tweak the Archer loader to use tkpng instead.  No more incorrect than it already was, and this should avoid issues tkimg seems to be having with libpng 1.4.1 - will go away altogether once upgrade to tk 8.6 happens.
