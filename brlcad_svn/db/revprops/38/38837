replace the proof-of-concept with something slightly less impressive but still with a dash of awesome.  improve the performance of the X display manager by eliminating repeat XAllocColor() calls.  original test bed showed about an order of magnitude improvement and had O(1) lookup time, but ate about 200MB of memory.  this uses a bu_list to stash the colors so we only use as much as we need.  seems to be still about a 5x-10x performance improvement over always doing the color lookups.

we presently don't free any of the memory we allocate in this static function, so there does need to be further work to periodically release these resources at least on dm close or atexit if not earlier.

wireframes are nice and smooth again where previously very chunky.  makes 1 havoc go from about 1.5 fps to about 10 fps.  makes 10 havocs go from 0.4 fps to about 2 fps.
