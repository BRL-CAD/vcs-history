bob fixed the mac input bug.  was some obscure problem related to calling 'focus' within the mged event handler on the mouse binding.  needs more work, but core problem is fixed.  tom suggested adding some means for force the tracers to overwrite the output file -- which seams reasonable so long as we're going to go to lengths to make them read-only via permissions.
