The Goblin library looks like it may have some graph layout capabilities along the lines of graphviz, it's LGPL licensed, and it already has some apps by the dev team that talk to it using tcl/tk.  Experiment with building it as part of BRL-CAD in the dmtogl branch, starting with the core libraries (no tcl/tk yet).  Very definitely should NOT be put in trunk until there are BRL-CAD features using it, which will be a while even if the feature set does prove appropriate for our uses.
