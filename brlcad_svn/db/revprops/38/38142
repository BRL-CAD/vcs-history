Function getCurveEstimateOfV() wasn't always converging to a solution before hitting iteration bound. Now uses binary subdivision of curve 't' parameter until derivatives at end points in 'u' are within 5 percent before using the original linear estimating method. Also increased the iteration bound to 1000.
