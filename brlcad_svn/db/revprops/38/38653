Added logic to ged_rt(...) to append "-u model" to 'rtarea' command when the user does not specify the output units explicitly. This means that 'rtarea' when run from within 'mged' will produce results in the current working model units unless overridden by the user. Note: For backward compatibility with existing scripts running 'rtarea' from the system command line(not from within mged) will still produce output in mm^2 unless otherwise specified with the '-u' option.
