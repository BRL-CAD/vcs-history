Have libged delete the saved_name item instead of the 'XXXXX' based name, which it's not creating in this routine.  Should prevent the comb dialog in mged from populating the database with lots of spurious tmp combinations and spewing errors. Also make the usage messages for put_comb slightly more helpful in situations where comb args are supplied with region flag set or vice versa.
