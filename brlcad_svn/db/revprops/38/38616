Less than ideal, but looks like it may function - use an html list of html articles with  links as the left hand side of the help browser, and activate the hyperlinks to display the resulting page in the right html viewer.  List is not complete yet and need a 'cover sheet' introduction page, but may serve to get things working in an initial cut.
