Toss in a temporary, minimalist 'display a pix image using a tk photo' program that will be used for isolated testing of Tcl threads and how they interact with Tk photo drawing - not (yet) simulating raytracing, just preparing to work on basics.  This program will be removed once threads are integrated into libdm/libfb proper.
