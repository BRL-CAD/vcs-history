Taking a stab at an mged/points approach to the libgcv obj logic, using the WITH_PARSERS option and the lex test in configure.ac.  Not sure exactly how to link libgcv and libobj together, so for the moment libobj is 'dangling' and not included in any installed library.  If this proves fragile in any, just restrict the obj directory in the libgcv Makefile.am to an extradist inclusion.
