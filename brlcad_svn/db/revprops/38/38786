pull change from buildconf upstream that applies sf patch #2991738 from tom browder (fix autogen.sh autoreconf error message).  problem seems to be aclocal propagating the include dir recursively but ending up with some Makefile.am scan failure if the directory is recursive.  This makes the path absolute and reportedly quiets those failures (for autoconf 2.64, automake 1.11) by making the path absolute.  to be seen if this causes other problems for subconfigure m4 directories.
