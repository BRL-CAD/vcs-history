add some additional validation checks related to sf report 1586998 (mged segfault) from Karel Kulhavy ( clock3 ).  was unable to reproduce his crash, but suspect that there's some obscure case wehere illump is either ending up invalid or illump->s_fullpath is invalid yet non-null, causing problems while we iterate, print, and free the vls.
END
