add similar LIKELY and UNLIKELY macros for branch prediction hinting.  be VERY brazen in making it clear that the new GCC_PREREQ and ICC_PREREQ macros are not intended to be used outside of the common.h header file (as client code should not be based on compilers, they should be based on tested features).
