Add Bob's script for swapping BoTs from facetall.sh into a tree instead of the CSG booleans - not turning this on as a command in MGED by default yet, but put it in so it can be sourced if needed.  Need to decide later how to expose this functionality for the user - maybe wrapping both facetall and rrmb logic into an option in a future bot command?
