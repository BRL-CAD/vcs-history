move Nu_open over from dm-Null.c for the temporary.  it's empty and only used in dm-generic right now during a dm_open.  keep until interp can be refactored out and callback added to dm struct.  clean up and reorganize dm-Null.c to avoid all forward declarations and quell all verbose compilation warnings.
