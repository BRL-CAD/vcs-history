add a new tcl command for mged called 'remap_mater'.  the command remaps material IDs in the currently open geometry database file based on simple remap rules in a specified input file.  the command is related to the existing 'remat' command, but provides distinctively different behavior.  the command was implemented by PJT in December 2000 and manually being shared amongst users.  now it's included directly.
