The backout/-b option to nirt is suppose to back the ray origin point out of the geometry. Internally the origin point was actually being backed up by the bounding sphere diameter. This backout method will still miss geometry if your origin point is out past the bounding sphere distance. This option now backs out a bounding sphere radius distance in front of the bounding sphere.
