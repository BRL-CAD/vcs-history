Start experimenting with simplifying the obj lex/yacc files with an eye towards targeting C instead of C++ and avoiding the complexity of a reentrant parser.  These files don't do anything yet - the point is to explore how the parser works and what it's doing.  Right now it just prints messages about what it is seeing.
