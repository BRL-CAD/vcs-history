totally punt for windows and turn off reporting unreferenced formal parameters (c4100).  alternative would be to call UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER() in the function body (which presumably sets the parameter to itself or some similar hack), but I'm not feeling it given they're already identified in a more open declarative manner for gcc.
