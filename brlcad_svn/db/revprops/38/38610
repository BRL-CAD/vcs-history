keith fixed a bug with nirt being from from within mged that was causing a crash (of either nirt or mged or both, potentially several other applications could be affected).  problem was bu_vls nibble bug that wasn't checking the size of the vls before nibbling causing an address to bad memory getting accessed.  this bug was informally reported by an arl user and fixed on the fly.
