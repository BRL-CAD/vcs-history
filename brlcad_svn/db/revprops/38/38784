The html viewers (man page and docs both) appear to be having problems with encoding similar to those described here - http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/SpecialChars.html.  This appears to be due to the Tcl encoding not being set to an encoding that handles properly all the characters being generated by the Docbook output, so when we kick off Archer set the encoding to utf-8.  This appears to clear up the problems.
