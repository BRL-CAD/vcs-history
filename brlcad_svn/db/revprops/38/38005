Take a stab at a feature-test based configure.ac approach to lex.  Per discussion with Sean, turn the parsers completely on or off if all requirements aren't met, since there is currently no code judged to be core critical that is using the parsers.  Undesirable to have partial on/off behavior, so do a feature based test and go all in or all out.
