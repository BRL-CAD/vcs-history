fix a crash reported by Tom Browder ( tbrowder2 ) via sf bug report 2974586 (Core Dump with mged 'solids' Command) where a stack trace showed a bogus vls.  since we don't know how memory will be initialized, calling bu_vls_init_if_uninit() here is wrong.  really should check all calls to that function for similar patterns of fail.
