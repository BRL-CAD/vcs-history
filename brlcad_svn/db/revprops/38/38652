Added external reference to 'model_units' flag. Added warning when using current model units as result units. Added some limited logic to show a common larger unit in the parenthesized portion of the result: mm^2,cm^2, dm^2 -> m^2, m^2 -> km^2, in^2 -> ft^2, ft^2 -> yd^2 otherwise defaults to mm^2.
