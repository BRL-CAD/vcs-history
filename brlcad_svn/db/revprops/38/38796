fb-png needs to include our png.h before any system includes - /usr/X11/include contains png.h on at least some systems.  Since we can't order the CPPFLAGS on a per-program basis without requiring automake 1.7, looks like we have to do it here.  This is obviously not ideal since many fb programs don't need PNG_CPPFLAGS, but does seem to work.
