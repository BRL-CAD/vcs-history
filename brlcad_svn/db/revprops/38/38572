fixed a bug with the solids command (which subsequently also affects the regions and idents commands) reported by tom browder (tbrowder2) via sf bug report 2974586 (Core Dump with mged 'solids' Command) where a provided stack trace showed a bad vls.  the problem was a call to bu_vls_init_if_uninit() on a vls that was not initialized but had non-zero data so never becomes initialized.  fix was to call bu_vls_init() instead.
