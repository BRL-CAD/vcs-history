good grief, messy wild assumptions going on in here regarding faces.  fix a processing bug that was causing a crash due to the parsed face and vertex data (which was being stashed in a bot internal) getting released during export.  instead, stash the vertex/face data into its own container that is memory managed separately.  since face ids accummulate as the file is procesed, keep them all even as we write out groups.  this in-core approach blindly and stupidly expands vertices as they're added to bots just as a matter of simplicity.  parsing logic still needs revamping to support 1/2/3 per face vertex indices and non-triangular polygons.
