probably most significant user-visible change, bob fixed the Mac input bug that was affecting 10.5+ platforms where mouse input would stall during interactive rotations.  this would occur after a zoom (mouse click) event.  Bob removed the calls to focus for button presses (even though they should be fine, so there's still something screwy).
