substantial overhaul of offset management for mem_map objects, db_scan()/db5_sca() handlers and dbi's dbi_eof position (from scan).  make them off_t's instead of size_t's as they do represent file and memory offsets, not sizes.  it's also a signed type so the -1 marker we use all over the place won't get converted through to a potentially unsigned type.
