bob fixed a bug/assumption in mged where it was failing to find rt, dbupgrade, asc2g, g2asc, asc-pl, and pl-asc on windows.  probably due to bu_brlcad_root not finding a file without the .exe suffix, causing the failure.  he added checks to see whether the windows exe suffix is needed.  this should fix a variety of spurious failures being observed on windows.
