test more names, add regex logic for build_region style endings.  need to think abou thow to handle potential incrementors - apparently regex can't tell me how many numbers are tucked in the string.  I can check and generate a regex string based on that, always use the first number before a period as the iterator (probably a bad idea), or...?
