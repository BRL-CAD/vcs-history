Refactored rt_clean_resource(). Now calls rt_clean_resource_basic(), then calls rt_resource_init().
rt_clean_resource_basic() contains most of what was in rt_clean_resource(), but without the
re-init. New method rt_clean_resource_complete() calls rt_clean_resource_basic(), frees the
directory blocks, and does not call re-init - frees ALL the resource memory.
