remove FAST_NMG, turning on the plethora of additional run-time NMG checks provided via NMG_CK_HITMISS and NMG_CK_HITMISS_LISTS.  still wrap them in NO_BOMBING_MACROS though so that they can still be disabled at compile-time.  modified NMG_CK_HITMISS_LISTS to not take the iterator and removed a slew of the checks that were rather .. gratuitous.
END
