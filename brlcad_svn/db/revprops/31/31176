this has come up so many times over the year, it needs to be documented so it can be eventually worked on.  develop a low-level tool for investigating, reporting statistics on, and repairing geometry database files.  the tool should nominally perform big/little endian conversions, report number and types of objects, allow deletion/undeletion/hiding/unhiding, provide some general means to manipulate the packed and unpacked .g file data for performing low-level modifications.  this tool would directly benefit both developers and users alike (particularly for repairing catastrophic .g mistakes and for debugging).
