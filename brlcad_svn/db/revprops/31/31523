prompted by sf bug report 1998145 (Windows Installation Version Confusion) by tom browder, try to make our Windows installer more version-aware.  this is rather untested but the jist is that it will install to programfiles/BRL-CAD/VERSION now and the uninstall registry keys become version-specific.  we also ensure that the installer filename being created conforms to the newly established convention.
