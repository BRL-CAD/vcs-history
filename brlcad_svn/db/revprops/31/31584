nice.. it's been hella long since I've apparently reviewed everything.. more completed.  indentation was run, eclectic was (briefly) reviewed, autogen.sh is recursive, configure doesn't test stuff it doesn't need to, center of presented areas are implemented, we have mirror around arbitrary vectors, and there's a script to parse sf.net trackers
