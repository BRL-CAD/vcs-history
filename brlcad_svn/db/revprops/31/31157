rewrite and modify bu_argv_from_string to make it more consistent with other functions.  the limit now corresponds to the number of non-NULL words being put into the argv array, not the size of the array (whose size includes the null).  this requires refactoring the function to keep better track of where it is while parsing including now the ability to have arbitrary amounts of whitespace between words so that it will tokenize like the command line and aren't bad run-on sentances the shiznits.  bu_argv_from_string still requires the caller to allocate enough space for the NULL in the argv array and to manage the memory associated with the input string; lim just doesn't include NULL in the count.  the count returned is similarly the matching argc for the number of elements set in argv.
