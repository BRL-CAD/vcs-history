sample of new primitive organization where each primitive will be housed in a subdir named by it's table label.  the intent will be to keep all of the table hook functions together in a main xxx.c file with structures and interface properties separated into an interface header, then allowing whatever other source files, documentation, and supporting materials to live in that directory with the primitive.  this new organization should better support the addition of a brep interface.
