reword the nirt backout line just so that we can make the commit log more substantial.  commit messages for NEWS lines need to be detailed as they're used during configuration reviews.  To quote Cliff's original log message for this feature: Change behavior of backout command in interactive nirt - backout flag can now be activated and deactivated, and repeated invocations of backout will not increase the backout distance with each invocation.  Also, change of origin due to backout use in shoot is now temporary - previous value is restored after shot is complete.
