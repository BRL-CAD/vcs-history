Mods related to adding the following commands to libtclcad's ged_obj: configure, delete_view, listen, new_view and zbuffer. The rt command was also enabled. These mods make it possible to create an instance of a ged_obj with 0 or more views. Each view is capable of displaying geometry as well as acting as a framebuffer server. Note - this interface is still a fairly low level Tcl interface to libged, libdm and libfb and is meant to provide the functionality for scripting and mega-widgets.
