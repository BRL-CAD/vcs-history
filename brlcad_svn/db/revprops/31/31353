Revision of the code (WIP) to set it up to BRL-CAD standards: naming conventions, doxygen documentation, ... Also a couple of new functionalities: to not waste CPU when the window is not visible (it seems that my contribution to OGRE a few years ago comes back to me), and making the mouse cursor visible (at least it was not visible in my platform)
