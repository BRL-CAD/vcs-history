Added gdv_gop member to struct ged_dm_view to simplify things in ged_obj.c. Added fbs_mode member to struct fbserv_client to keep track of the framebuffer mode. Changed GED_ to BRLCAD_ in few places (more later). Added the following commands to ged_obj.c: go_vmake, go_draw, go_set_fb_mode. Added code to ged_obj.c to define default bindings for Configure, Expose and WM_DELETE_WINDOW events.
