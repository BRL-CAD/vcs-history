bob added this option way back in 2005 ( 15 Aug 2005 21:43:07 to be exact ) but it was never documented.  this option makes rtcheck write the plot file data in text format instead of the default binary format.  binary should probably not be the default, so presumably this was a first step towards that direction; at least it lets you get text instead of binary so you can avoid the tty warning about binary output.  reduce globals by one, the code is updated to reuse the exist output_is_binary global instead of using rt_text_output.
