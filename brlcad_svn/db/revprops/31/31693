rename pc_constraint.c to constraint.c since it's the librt interface, and rename the database object callbacks it provided accordingly to be rt_ prefixed.  the rt_constraint_internal can then be used as the rt db io container and internally it can refer to some (as yet non-existent) libpc structure so there is a clean separation between the two api's.
