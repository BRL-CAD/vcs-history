prompted by sf bug report 1998145 by tom browder, document a standardized naming scheme for source and binary releases so that our filenames can be more consistent.  Basically, still use brlcad-version.extension for source distributions, but consistently using BRL-CAD_version[_optional_other_stuff].extension for binary releases.
