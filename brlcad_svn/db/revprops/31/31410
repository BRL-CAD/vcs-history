Added files scanline.c and scanline.h, to contain functions and definitions of scanline, that are shared by view.c and viewmlt.c. Updated msvc9 build files and the Makefile.am. Moved and modified free_scanlines() function to work with parameters (int height and struct scanline* scanline). Updated view_pixel() function in viewmlt.c and made some other minor changes in the file.
