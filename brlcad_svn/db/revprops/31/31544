increase the column spacing to 25 characters, making a max of 100 wide instead of 80 .. this is a real shame but stems from the problem that the command names are way too long on dgo_set_plOutputMode, dgo_set_transparency, dgo_set_outputHandler, and a few others. increasing the width makes it so you can iterate over the commands (while messing with default width wrapping)
