Many pending commits due to SourceForge downtime, cannot be separated now: Important increase in functionality of CameraMode base class to allow for the now more complex derived camera modes, including managing their own input bindings; implemented Blender camera mode including mouse drag mode for free camera rotations; fixed parts of input handling which were still immature (traping events when they shouldn't, etc).
