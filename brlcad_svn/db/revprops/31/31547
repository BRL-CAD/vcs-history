add a new regression test for mged.  it makes sure mged will run, can create a geometry database, and then evalutes the commands available.  for every command available, it makes sure that it exits, runs successfully without reporting an error, and has a help/usage statement.  this has already unvelieved a few issues that should get fixed (edcolor kicking off an editor, rt-tools crashing with a bu_log write error, few commands missing (recent libged changes)).
