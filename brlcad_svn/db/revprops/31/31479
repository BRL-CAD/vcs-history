Proof of concept - the new mged_commands.xml contains a little of the extensive command appendix in Volume II as a valid stand-alone article, and the VolumeII.xml here references inside that file to grab the content for inclusion in its own appendix using XInclude and xpointer.  If this technique scales, it will be possible to break down the volumes into individual valid files that can be assembled by VolumeII.xml to reproduce (more or less) the original VolumeII contents as well as making them available in other forms.
