REGEX_CPPFLAGS MUST COME AFTER TCL INCLUDE PATHS .. else you can end up with unresolved regex symbols due to tcl's double #define redirection of regex calls from their regex.h header.  Symptom of this problem is unresolved TclReFree symbols during linking of libs that use tcl and/or unresolved regcomp, regerror, and regexec symbols in libraries that don't use tcl.
