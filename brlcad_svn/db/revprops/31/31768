boost::spirit import and other boost updates. Spirit is an object-oriented recursive-descent parser generator framework implemented using template meta-programming techniques. Expression templates allow us to approximate the syntax of Extended Backus-Normal Form (EBNF) completely in C++. Spirit would be particularly helpful in writing the parser for generating constraints from expressions for libpc with its object oriented methodology and particularly helpful interface for supporting functors. Spirit details available at http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/spirit/index.html
