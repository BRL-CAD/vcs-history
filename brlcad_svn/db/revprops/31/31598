Removing Taskbar as separate window, and reintroduce it instead as a 'frame' window, part of the WindowManager class.  This makes sense since WindowManager is already going to have the list of available windows, it should subtract the size of the taskbar when passing the available screen size to the rest of the windows, etc.
