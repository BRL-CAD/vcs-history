My patch (might I say quick and DIRTY hack instead?) to get keyboard autorepeat working inside RBGui.  I tried to contact RBGui guys so it's done properly upstream, along with the other patches needed (I offered myself as maintainer, so to speak), but proper implementation for this kind of things would be probably after GSoC period -- the project is demanding enough.
