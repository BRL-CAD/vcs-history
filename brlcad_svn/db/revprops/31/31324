Add several additional built-in formatting options for nirt, specifiable using the -f option and stored in brlcad's global data directory.  nirt -L option lists available formats, will check directory at runtime instead of compile time thanks to new uce-dirent functionality.  One of the new formats addresses the TODO request for reporting exit points instead of LOS.
