fixed a bug detected by the solids regression test where dsp primitives were failing due to the change made in r31629 that made the converted the dsp's former rt_parsetab_tclget() (now rt_dsp_get()) routine from Tcl_DStringAppendElement to bu_vls_printf calls which are not equivalent.  The Tcl_DStringAppendElement() calls automatically pad spaces, so have to manually pad the bu_vls_printf() call.
