Bob fixed a long-standing bug reported by Tom Browder where rt/rtedge were incorrectly clipping the render due to an invalid eye point calculation.  The problem was traced down to code commited all the way back in 1997 where the longest dimension of the bounding box was used as the default eye point backout distance.  This in turn could cause clipping if the diagonal distance was considerablly larger and when rendering from a non-orthogonal view.  it does not seem to be intentional and only occurred when rt/rtedge was invoked from within mged (where the dgo interface gets called).  this fixes sf bug 1525332 (Rt (and Rtedge) Clips Image).
