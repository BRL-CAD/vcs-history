style and formatting are only issues when they are completely disregarded.. please be more careful/consistent with the style guide.  much of these changes aren't even self-consistent within a single function.  use space after commas and intrinsic keywords (if, while, for) but not after functions or within parens; prefer spaces around operators (especially for streams).  whitespace and indents also seem to be horribly inconsistent (run sh/ws.sh and sh/indent.sh if you're unsure).  shouldn't be an after-the-fact exercise, just becomes redundantly more expensive and isn't coding complete.
