this renames the wdb_binary / dbbinary mged command to just 'binary' .. this seems to be what it is actually used in archer already, what makes more sense, and is more consistent with other commands.  happened to fix a mistake in the html docs in the process.  also updated the command's help so that it's less brain dead wrong in response to tom browder's sf bug 1532699 (dbbinary -o help is misleading)
