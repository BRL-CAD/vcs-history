icv_image_save() cannot fail to do what it's told or we'll have to update all possible caller code to have pix fallback recovery code.  no reason that cannot happen here.  guess the format, but use PIX for anything unrecognized.  note some bad fixed-size buffer assumptions already getting introduced.
