Well, this example doesn't (yet) apply to the c command, since it turns out c and comb are currently different commands...  commit it so it's in the repo.  Will be looking at merging c and comb - if that can't work for whatever reason, will copy c.xml to comb.xml and sort out the contents accordingly.
