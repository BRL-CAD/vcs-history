enable stack protection for non-optimized debug-enabled builds.  for gcc 4.1+ this is -fstack-protector-all, for clang it's -qstackprotect.  wouldn't think we need both, but would need to check the c/cxx flags independently otherwise in case the caller is compiling c with clang and cxx with g++ (for example).  easier to just check them both to handle such situations.
