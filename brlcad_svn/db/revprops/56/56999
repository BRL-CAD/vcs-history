expand the results of our (nick and my) brainstorming session for how to fix our attribute system issues.  we need versioning and a means to upgrade a file to newer conventions.  shouldn't be much more work to use that same system for downgrading too.  include several tasks related to this envisioned plan.  comments and discussion welcome.
