since TIE tries to be coherent, document the sizes of each of the struct elements and ensure that we stay on 4-byte boundaries.  ironically shows that several core data structs do not fit within a cache line when using double-precision, so this is far from optimal.  related and most significantly, I'm adding two new 'b' fields (on tie_tri_s and tie_kdtree_s) to hold kd-tree data.  reason why will become apparent in the next commit.
