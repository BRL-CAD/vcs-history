Preparing to remove dbfind, add -a and -h/-? options for search.  The latter are the standard help options, and the former allows search to look at hidden combs.  Still don't offer exactly the same functionality as dbfind with the -a option - because search always does a full pathc search under the hood, combs that exist only under a hidden comb won't show up.  May want to add a -f option to allow a truly 'flat' search
