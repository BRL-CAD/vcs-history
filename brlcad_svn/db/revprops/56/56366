This needs some careful tests - I'm not sure that I'm properly interpreting the meaning of the left/right tree walk for all the boolean cases - but add an array to db_full_path that lets us stash the boolean states all along the tree.  The f_bool test can now query based on the current path, which should let options like -above do the right thing.
