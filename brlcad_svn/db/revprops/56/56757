fix a bug when checking C and CXX flags sequentially, the latter was always getting the cached result because the same cache variable name was being specified.  this was presenting itself as CC: unrecognized option '-Qunused-argument' messages (which is apparently not a valid C++ flag, but is valid for C) and potentially any other flag where the result should be different (obviously).
