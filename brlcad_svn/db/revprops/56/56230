bob fixed/changed archer to now respect and propagate the LIBRT_BOT_MINTIE environment variable.  previously, the existing archer preference for that variable would override if a .archerrc file even got saved and users would still have to set the environment variable for sub-process rt/rtedge invocations.  now the preference will pass down to sub-processes and it respects the env var if it's set.
