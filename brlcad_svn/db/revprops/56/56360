Make a stab at adding the ability to look at booleans in the tree as part of the search command - for example, 'search /all.g -bool + ! -type arb8' will find all objects in the tree of all.g that are intersected as part of a comb and are not arb8 primitives.  Needs more thought and testing - this may not even be the final approach - but it seems to be a step in the right direction.
