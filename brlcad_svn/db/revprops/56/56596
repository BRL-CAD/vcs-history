force POSIX locale since our tcl script infrastructure expects it.  we could get away with just performing locale restrictions within the tcl callback functions, but right now that is several hundred potential functions where we'd be introducing redundant code.  another possibility might be to introduce a tcl command like 'zoom [clocale 0.5]' so the scripts themselves become aware, and that would probably be best and a lot of work.
