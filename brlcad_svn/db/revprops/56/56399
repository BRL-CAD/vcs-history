Added -f option to the comb command, which will take a single comb as an input, check whether all boolean operations in its tree are unions, and if they are make a new tree under the comb that unions all the solids directly into the comb.  Will also remove 'orphaned' combs that are no longer used by any other object in the tree, but ignores combs that are used elsewhere.
