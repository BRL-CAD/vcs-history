accept sf patch #187 Code Reduction in bwhisteq-2 (https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/187/) from mohit daga that avoids iterating over the bins unnecessarily.  cuts two lines overall but more interestingly was compared with an equivalent matlab function.  results were nearly identical with differences assumed to be floating point drift/error.
