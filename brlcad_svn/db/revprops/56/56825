revert r56812 after doing a little bit of performance testing.  it's looking like my change that got things working on 32-bit definitely did slow TIE down (was expected), but r56812 slows it down another 5-15% (tested on models up to 200k).  interesting to see how touchy the performance is, but this is to be expected when one deals with data coherency, branch prediction, and memory alignment optimizations.
