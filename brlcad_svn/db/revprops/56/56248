Added file libicv/color_space.c . This will contain all the color_space conversion api functions (currently rgb-gray and gray-rgb, later others like hsv-rgb, cmyka-rgb etc..). Added gray2rgb api function. This does a simple gray pixel copying at three places(r,g,b). This api function does an inplace color_space change.
