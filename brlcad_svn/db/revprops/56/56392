Add a -f option to the comb command that will flatten a combination that contains only unions, and delete any orphaned combinations that were formerly present in that comb's tree but not used elsewhere in the .g file.  This is the first significant programmatic use of the search capabilities other than the search command itself.  Full comb -f example added to the comb man page.
