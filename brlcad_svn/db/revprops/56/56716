provide an interface for managing the summary/logging output, allowing calling applications to register a printing function (such as printf, bu_log, puts, etc).  instead of tying the printing to bu_debug being set, read the BU_HEAP_PRINT environment variable.  take some minimal steps to minimize how many atexit() handlers are registered in a parallel situation, though the handler also checks.
