Added -l option to comb command that 'lifts' the region flag to the top level comb and clears all region flags in the tree below that comb.  Has some advanced features, like automatically wrapping regions that are used elsewhere in the .g file and referencing the comb created by the wrap, and refusing to perform the operation if it cannot be done without changing assembly definitions used elsewhere in the tree (see the comb man page for examples.)
