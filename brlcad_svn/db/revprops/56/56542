Add a -o option to the bb command for generating oriented bounding boxes instead of the axis-aligned boxes (the default case).  Currently only works on individual BoT objects, but can be expanded to other types in the future.  Contacted author of the gdiam code (http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/papers/98/bbox.html) and he agreed to dual-license the code under GPLv2 and LGPL 2.1, the latter of which is compatible with BRL-CAD.  A slightly modified version of this code is now integrated into src/other and forms the core algorithmic basis for the bb -o option.
