Ah, right.  Because search expressions run the risk of looking like options, we need to constrain the bu_getopt search to the front of the argv string.  Do one pass to count the maximum possible number of options.  Then, do a second pass and make sure that anything counted as an option is in the front of the argv array.  May have to impose even stronger restrictions by identifying a valid path or search expression term and haulting there - we'll see.
