Added new grazing tolerance definition "BREP_GRAZING_TOL" currently set to 0.000017453(or 0.001 degrees) was using RT_DOT_TOL at 0.001 (0.05 degrees) but causing to many grazing differences with CSG comparison test. Also tighted up the utah_pushBack() so keeps UV with domain of interest(I think this was loosened for some of the STEP pullbacks).  Added utah_pushBack() to previous halfstep loop in newton iterater which tries to fix over stepping. I the IN/OUT BREP stiching logic removed a loop that removed NEAR_HITs on ODD hit counts because it was being done before the remove duplicate points logic. Fixed sign problem on final SBV check of BREP root solver where I added VUNITIZE_TOL.
