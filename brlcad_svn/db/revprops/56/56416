Add a new file encoding.c. This file will contain data conversion for saving and loading from different formats of images. These routines will act as a bridge. For eg. file.someformat ---> Use routine from this file --> Load to icv_image struct --> do processing --> Use routines from this file for desired formats --> Save in the desired format.
