Add initial stab at implementation of the 'lift region' option to comb (-l) that clears out all region flags below the specified combination and sets the region flag on the specified combination.  If a region is used in another tree, this option uses the wrapping functionality to swap regions for combs in the local tree while preserving the region's properites elsewhere, except when doing so would yank the region flag out from a comb that is defining something in another tree. (basic option is described in man page, examples will be added to clarify.)
