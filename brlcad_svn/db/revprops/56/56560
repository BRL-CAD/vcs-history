remove three dead and long-unused functions that have been under if 0 wrappage: nmg_insert_vu_if_on_edge(), nmg_face_combineX(), and nmg_face_next_vu_interval(). they even seem interesting/complete, but are not integrated, easily tested, or fully understood so remove the burden. nmg has enough complexity without retaining some for reference.
