In order for beset to work with the LOCAL flag (which a recent change rolled in with NO_INSTALL) it needs to have its build target in the beset subdirectory - otherwise, the binary output name conflicts with the directory in the gtools build dir holding the beset information.  Should fix the in-src-dir build.
