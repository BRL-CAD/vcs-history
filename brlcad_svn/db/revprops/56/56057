overhaul the rec shot routine.  eliminates a recently introduced magic constant (1.0e10) that wasn't correct (a big root does not indicate a need to check the end plates).  completely restructure the logic to eliminate the gotos and the associated spagetti.  now we always check the cylinder and end plates, collapsing any duplicate points.  these changes were tested extensively with a default rec from all possible orientations showing no change other than face normal on grazing edge. performance was actually faster for most views (but within 5% noise).
