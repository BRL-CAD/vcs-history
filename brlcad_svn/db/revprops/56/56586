Created an OpenCL branch for some experimental performance impact testing.  Looking to feed the primitive evaluations through OpenCL for starters to evaluate the scalability and performance impact for a limited set of primitives.  This is intended to be proof-of-concept work, not working production code nor any guarantees implied (including portable compilation).
