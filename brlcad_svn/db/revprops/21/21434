Added checks to editit() for an X display manager when attempting to fire off an Xterm for external edits.  If there is not X display support, we assume console mode behavior and do what the console mged did (edit in the current console).  XXX It would be ideal if mged was a full console so we did not have to spawn external xterms.tedit.c

Also fixed a minor bug where the forked child process closes all of its file descriptors (incluing stdin) that causes some platforms to immediately close the execd process (since no input is supposedly available).  This happened on OSX.
