view_setup() now handles code 2 return from mlib_setup (from light_setup) by
adding the region to the "delete_regs" list in rt_i.
view2_init() now processes regions on the "delete_regs" list immediately
after calling light_init(). All references to these regions are deleted
from soltabs in the space partitioning tree.
