Added comments, fixed some bugs, added a validation against mgeds actual current available geometry, now keep track of good and bad geometry (though still no means to mark), added hooks to be called and loaded cleaner via the sister "geometree" command (that actually creates the object), set up the object to dynamically update. (whew\!)
