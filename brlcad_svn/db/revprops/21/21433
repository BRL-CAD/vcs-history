Mods from Bob Parker:
	- Mods to the "invoke" method to better handle braces in incomplete commands
          (i.e. the user is building a proc across multiple lines) when the
          cmd_prefix is not the empty string.

        - Added support for the -prompt2 option. The itk_option(-prompt2) string
          will be used when the command is in an incomplete state.

END
