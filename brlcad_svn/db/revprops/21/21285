This is a basic flat shader.  Two accepted parameters are color and transparency.  Both are triplets in the 0 to 1 range.  The transparency triplet will let you specify alpha blending on a per-channel basis.  This shader should be considerably faster than getting phong to do the same thing by setting the parameters as needed.  Great for 2d overlays and space occupancy tests (visual).
