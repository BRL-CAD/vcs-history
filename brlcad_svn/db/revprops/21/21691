Added support to embed projection shader file details into the shader parameter string.  first the parameter is attempted as a file, as before.  if that fails, then it is treated as a parameter string.  actual data is parsed identically regardless of source.  this is a "really good thing" since it is one less external file that needs to be carried around with a database\!
