Reworked the globe generator to properly create shells and appropriate sub-geometry now.  Unveiled in liboptical appears to be a bug that occurs after four transparent layers are displayed.  This occurs with both the phong and flat shaders (with slightly different results).  The resulting shade ends up being a default color value (flat color of object for phong, and white for flat).
