Fixed a bug/feature where processing is aborted (bombing macro) when a dsp is loaded that doesn't have the cut type set or when a dsp is loaded that cannot find it's data.  Both checks are now added and rt continues gracefully instead of bombing, mimicking other rt behavior when invalid/bad data is encountered.

END
