Removed cake's general "PRODUCTION" define.  It was causing more confusion that necessary, especially with the BUILD_PRODUCTION flag that turns on special source optimizations (-DPRODUCTION flag).
Now each individual build flag is manually set, avoiding confusion between which "mode" we are building in and still what options are set/unset.
