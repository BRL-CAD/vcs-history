Adding this new proc that takes an image file and generates a geometry file based off of it.  Each pixel consists of object/primitive that has it's rgb set to the image rgb.  All of the pixels are, of course, spread out in a regular planar grid.  Future enhancements could include pixel masking (don't create objects where there are certain pixel values, etc) and replacing the current object/primitive (it's a sphere) with other geometry (even other regions).  Possible use could be to automatically place items on a planar grid (say trees or grass).  *shrug*  As a side note, this script unveiled a bug/feature in how very large combinations are created, such that the stack is blown at runtime.  This script presently breaks the combination up into scanlines due to that problem.
