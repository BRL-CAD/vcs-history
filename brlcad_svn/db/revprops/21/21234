Chuck investigated the (obscure) problem converting data to network unsigned shorts.  Updated the supported output formats to support the signed and unsigned short and long output formats.

Previous support was ifdefed out possibly due to an attempt (?) to merge the signed and unsigned int functions (htonss & htonus & htonul & htonsl (was called htonas & htonal)).  Functionality (hton?? functions) already existed, though was not being used.

Also reformatted the text. ;)
