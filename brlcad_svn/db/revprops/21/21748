fixed a double-free bug in the particle primitive where a locally malloced pointer is freed after detecting an invalid value, the calling function then also tries to free the same memory.  the pointer needed to be set to null so that it is no longer accessible, I also added commenting to identify the different kinds of errors encountered during runtime.
