-* extended the behavior of db_walk_tree. Previously it would return -1
   iff absolutely no geometry could be loaded. It now returns -2 if
   some geometry could be loaded, but there were unresolved names.
-* rt_gettrees_muves supports the -2, it is passed to the caller.
-* rt_gettree and rt_gettrees filter the -2 and return 0 for
   backward compatibility.
