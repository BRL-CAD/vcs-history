Added binary object support to the texture shader!  The texture shader can now import data from either an external file (that gets mmap'd) or an internal binary object (binunif).  The data source may be explicitly specified (file or obj) or automatically inferred (texture).  Auto inferred types try objects first, then files for source data.  Implementation follows the "general" idea/logic of the similar support in librt/g_dsp.c.

Also modified name attribute to be a vls.
