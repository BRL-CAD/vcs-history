Some of the "in" functions were not using the passed in "internal" struct.
If they failed, the calling function called rt_db_free_internal() on the unused
internal and caused a dump. Now all input functions that do not use the internal struct
set internal.idb_ptr to NULL, and the caller checks this before freeing.
