Fixed an SMP race-condition bug when raytracing out to a file and the image size is less that 96 (BUFMODE_UNBUF).  An unprotected fwrite was causing incorrect pixel values to be written and possible segfaults.  Fix was to add an explicit fseek (since the fwrites are not atomic or thread-safe the passed file pointer may get corrupted) and semaphore protect the seek/write.
