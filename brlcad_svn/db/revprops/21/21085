When the DSP was using a database object for data, the data was being released
when rt called dsp_ifree after calling prep().  The dsp_prep() func was
copying the pointer for use in the dsp_specific structure.  The data was going
"poof".  Now the dsp_prep() func copies the pointer, but clears it in the
version that was passed in.  Now the data doesn't go poof.
