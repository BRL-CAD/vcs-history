reimplement bezier curve drawing for the sketch editor so that it no longer uses the tkCanvasBezier custom tk modification, instead just using simple tk line segment drawing, but sampling/evaluating the bezier as needed.  code for calc_bezier was taken directly from the C code and is of course a bit slower since it's in tcl, but certainly fast enough for most purposes where the degree of the bezier curve is relatively low.  that should be pulled back to C land as an optimization down the road.  this change (finally) fully decouples the brl-cad build from needing access to private tk structures during compilation since the bezier canvas is no longer being used.
