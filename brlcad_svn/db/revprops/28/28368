since tcl/tk are being compiled dynamic now instead of static and because they're not libtool libraries, libtool fails to find their uninstalled .so/.dylib files in src/other, and the wrapper script over binaries fails to search the provided -L paths.  so here we manually set LD/DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH before attempting to invoke the (uninstalled) binary during the compilation process.
