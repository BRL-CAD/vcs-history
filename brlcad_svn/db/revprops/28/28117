preliminary support for unaccelerated mgen on aqua through dm-tk

configure.ac:
        - use two levels of expansion for BRLCAD_DATA
        - enable_aqua configure option
        - move X11 ac_ macro tests from argument check section
        - rely on AC_PATH_XTRA to figure out most of what we need to know about
                where to find X
        - no longer look for libICE, libXmu, or libXsm  AC_PATH_XTRA
                populates X_PRE_LIBS with these but they seem completely unused
                right now.
        - look for opengl libs and headers in all of the places AC_PATH_XTRA
                looked for the xlibs
        - use tk's xlib headers when using tk-aqua rather than x
        - remove X11 "ugly hack"
        - include tk flags where necessary
        - remove --disable-shared from subconfigs
        - forcibly add tcl and tk build dirs to libtool wrapper scripts
libdm/Makefile.am, dm-tk.[ch], dm.h, dm-generic.c, dm_obj.c, mged/Makefile.am,
                attach.c, dm-generic.c, dm-tk.c, ged.c:
        - use lower case when referring to tk
        - add support for using dm-tk
        - include X_CFLAGS with DM_X
irprep/Makefile.am, util/Makefile.am:
        - disable build of ir-X, pl-X when there is no X
dm-X.c:
        - no need to test for HAVE_X11_XLIB here; if we don't have it we
                shouldn't be building this file
libfb/Makefile.am, if_tk.c, libfb/tcl.c:
        - build if_tk.c
        - add preliminary hooks so if_tk can be called when ready
