adding an initial script used to create or recreate the symbolic links in an installation root directory where multiple versions are retained.  the script currently creates the links in a directory (e.g. /usr/brlcad) to point to some specified current stable version (e.g. /usr/brlcad/rel-7.10.0).  more work needed to recreate/relink properly still, but it's a start.
