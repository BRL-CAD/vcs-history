once again, john continues to rock and rock hard he does with this latest addition -- tab-completion for mged.  he added tab bindings for both classic and tcl gui mode where the commands complete out and then during command processing, tab expands out to the available objects including down a geometry path.  this has been a long-desired, often-requested feature.  very awesome, even if it doesn't use readline/libedit. ;)
