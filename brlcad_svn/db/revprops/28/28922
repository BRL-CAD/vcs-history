The c89 headers are all fair game since it's been a requirement since the move to ANSI c89 compliance.  So.. remove the HAVE_STDLIB_H checks and just use the header.  The headers <complex.h>, <fenv.h>, <inttypes.h>, <stdbool.h>, <stdint.h>, and <tgmath.h> were added with C99 and still need to be checked.  There are several other c89 headers that we could just use, though, that are still being checked.
