add support for automatic logging of benchmark results to a file.  this is so users don't have to rerun and/or manually capture output if they want to review the output in detail.  also included is the date/time and uname of the system running the analysis.  make the file path searching output verbose-only now.  docs updated to reflect all these changes.
