change behavior by 1.0e-77 or 1.0e-39 such that we now consistently check whether values are > or <= SMALL (or SMALL_FASTF) instead of just < in some places and > in others.  did not change the SQRT_SMALL_FASTFs (other than those via SMALL) just to make sure there are not any unexpected results with this batch first.  this should of course only tweak edge cases that are well within floating point fuss, but they should be all treated consistently regardless.
