big update/enhancements so that pl-X is actually functional and useful.  if the last command in a plot file is an erase command, don't do it (wth show a black window).  most importantly, keep the window up until the user presses a key.  additional goodness, if we're on Mac OS X, make sure X11 has focus.  ignore newlines in the file for kicks.
