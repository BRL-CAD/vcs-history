john points out a blatent thread locking problem where a BU_SEM_SYSCALL is acquired prior to a bu_calloc() which itself also attempts to acquire that same semaphore.. how the hell did that ever work??  make it use RT_SEM_RESULTS instead since it is simply initializing the results array.  also, toss in some flushed output to avoid flooding the mged command windows to see if that helps with a separate lockup issue.  finally, remove the USE_FORKED_THREADS hack for linux, which presumably was probably added because of this semaphore bug.
