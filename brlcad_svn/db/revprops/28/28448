opennurbs_system.h has compiler checks for alloca and inclusion of alloca -- just needs another for sun.  not as robust as the lengths autoconf suggests, but then neither is using our brlcad_config.h in a public header.  need to retest on sun/irix to see if the ON_COMPILER_IRIX and ON_COMPILER_SUN work (else tweak the defines).
