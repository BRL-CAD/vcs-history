improve the libtk functionality test with the help of ertugerata (thx!) so that it no longer uses Tk_Init() (which had the unfortunate side-effect of attempting to talk to an X11 server and wanting DISPLAY to be set).  instead, it now uses Tk_GetScrollInfo which basically just parses a number out of a string.
