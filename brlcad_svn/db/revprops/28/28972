include a unique/special/new section specfically for the folks that have worked on documentation.  this minimally includes betty schueler (mged tutorial vol2), eric edwards (VAST MAJORITY of the tutorial series vol1234), dwayne kregel (Principles of effective modeling vol3), and cliff yapp (docbook conversion efforts).  the developers are specifically *not* listed under the doc writer and other sections since they tend to apply to all of them, so make a note of that in the intro otherwise the list would be considerably longer and repetitious.

END
