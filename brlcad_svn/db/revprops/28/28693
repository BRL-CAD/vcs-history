WOO HOO... tkCanvasBezier, the custom Tk extension that has complicated matters for getting into apt, portage, fink, and more is now no longer needed.  The sketch editor's bezier drawing code was rewritten to no longer use that canvas and instead just draw using ordinary Tk line segments, but evaluating the bezier curve directly just like the canvas was doing.  This was the last feature holding up release 7.10.2 so we're now on the green light for compilation and regression testing so that a release can be made.
