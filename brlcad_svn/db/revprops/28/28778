aha, finally realized what is going awry... since the samples were previously already allocated to the hard-coded max, the sample generator just used the slots as needed, keeping track of them with lt_pt_count as new ones were needed.  what that means, though, is that we need to ensure an allocation before ALL of the places that lt_pt_count is incremented since that is when we need/make a new point.  this (finally) fixes the crashes I was seeing when multiple shadow rays were requested and it actually makes sense why.  .. and now users can actually request ten thousand shadow rays if they really want it, and it'll actually work
