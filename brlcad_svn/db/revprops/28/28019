initial brlcad-config script template that, similar to pkg-config, can report on various cflags/cppflags and libs/ldflags for 3rd-party developers to use for linking against brl-cad's various libraries individually or collectively.  could undoubtedly use some more work and additional features like reporting on other various configure-time and compile-time options that get used for a given build, but this should get the ball rolling.
