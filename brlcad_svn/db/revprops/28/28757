remove the 'automatic flags' configure option (royal pita to keep track of cleanly in the configure logic for trivial gain) for now; rename the aquatk configure option to be consistent with the others and make it actually pass that on to tk's configure; and add a proper JavaVM framework check, using it instead of a platform test.
