mr. anderson fixed the dbconcat of empty combinations that was causing mged to crash.  adjust_names() in wdb_obj.c (part of dbconcat) was being passed comb->tree without checking for a null value.  john added a check for null and skips the combination (as null means it's an empty combination).  this fixes two bugs reported by karel kulhavy, sf bug 1800310 (ASCII import segfault in mged) and 1800306 (dbconcat segfaults).
