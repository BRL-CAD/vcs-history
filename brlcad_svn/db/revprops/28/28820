The test for Tk failued for me on several platforms with no valid
DISPLAY set (perhaps due to an X server running and just assuming
unsetting display will do it? or perhaps tcl84, which worked...
*shrug*). Changed the Tk_GetScrollInfo() to Tk_ParseArgv with the
supporting framework and this seems to work consistantly for me.
