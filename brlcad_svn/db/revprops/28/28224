add a memory buffer failsafe to bu_bomb() that will release an allocation (64k) prior to performing the shutdown calls (some syscalls, some others may have tiny allocations of their own even for string/print processing).  this is of course down to give the app a tiny bit of breathing room so that hopefully there's enough room to shutdown cleanly.
