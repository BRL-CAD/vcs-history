add an experimental 'minimal' testing ray tracer based on rt that is just one file.  it's a humongous unified ray tracer (hurt) that shouldn't even be compiled by default.  presently weighs in at about 2k lines total (not including lib code) with huge portions of rt functionality ripped out.  again, this is just for experimental use only so don't expect anything to come of this.
