jason feels it's probably best to make mods to openNURBS itself now in order to fully integrate/complete the brep implementation and given his implementation uses libbu and libbn extensively, this move will make openNURBS similarly dependent.  thus, the intent is to then to effectively fork openNURBS and make it a noinst brl-cad sub-library (either in librt or up a level) for obtaining brep support.
