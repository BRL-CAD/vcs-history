fix anonymous report of configure failure on 7.10.0 where turning off urt would result in a configure failure.  the problem was a variety of checks for configure settings that checked for the wrong value (!no instead of !yes, where default is "auto"). so the default worked, but not when the 3rd party lib was disabled.
