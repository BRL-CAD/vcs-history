initial implementation of a crash report generator that works with the new backtrace support.  included in the crash report are additional details like the version of BRL-CAD; kernel, OS, and hardware info (via sysctl and uname commands); and the stack trace.  needs more work to avoid allocations and not utilize stack data in case of corruption, but it's a good start.
