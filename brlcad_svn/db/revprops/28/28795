fixed a bug encountered when ray-tracing really tiny TGC objects (sub-millimeter size) caused by the REC prep routine thinking it was a valid right elliptical cone (when it wasn't).  the problem was due to a bad magnitude check and an insufficient hard-coded 'smallness' constant.  the result was rays that would miss portions of the tgc entirely, only counting the 'middle' portion that would have corresponded with an REC.
