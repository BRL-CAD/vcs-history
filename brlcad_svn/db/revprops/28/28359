massive refactoring of the src path handling including avoiding the dynamic atexit memory fugliness.  improve the actual searching for a src dir to not require allocations.  actually only check for init.tcl/tk.tcl one now.  make the entire routine more cross-platform, using BU_DIR_SEPARATOR and BU_PATH_SEPARATOR respectively when building up and searching for paths.
