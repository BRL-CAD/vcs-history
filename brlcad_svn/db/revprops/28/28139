revert the stashing of COPYING and INSTALL into memory due to issues with a handful of shells/environments where it would cause unpredictable shell behavior.  instead, save backup files as needed (recursively).  additional awesomeness, set up trap signal handlers to clean up regardless of how/when autogen.sh terminates or is otherwise aborted.
