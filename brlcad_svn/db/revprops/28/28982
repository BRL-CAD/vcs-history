fixed crash in mged ls -A attribute listing command, related to karel's sf patch 1800301 (ls -A claimed to be accepted, isn't).  the arguments where getting checked with an off-by-one error, but even with that problem fixed -- the command would crash mged due to an avs being freed that was never initialized.  avs is now always freed too so the problem goes away.
