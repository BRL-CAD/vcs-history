fix a bug on filesystems computing the buffer size on 64bit filesystems.  we shouldn't directly attempt to allocate a buffer equal to the input file size, but with the size_t it should actually work (casting from off_t) so long as the size is less than max size_t.  add some extra error checking while we're in here and get rid of a global.
