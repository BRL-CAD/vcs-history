the BRL-CAD documentation is available under a dual-license strategy allowing for recepients to choose between the GFDL and GPL.  this allows for the documentation to be included on otherwise opaque distribution mediums and over-zealous packaging distributions that don't seem to agree with allowing minor invariant sections (which none of brl-cad's docs have anyways).
