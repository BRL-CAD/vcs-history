rework db5_import_attributes() hopefully resolving a long-standing (4 years) issue with simply referencing the external representation's memory buffer in the ap pointer.  this prevents a strdup otherwise required for _every_ single attribute, using up twice as much memory for attributes.  this version also only allocates exactly what it needs without the extra padding, and only as it needs it per the rate set in bu_avs_add if AVS_ADD is defined (otherwise it's all allocated in one shot).
