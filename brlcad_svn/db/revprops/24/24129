arrrrgh!!!  rtedge was using a global named background, which was removed when liboptical picked up the rt background variable of the same name.  the problem is that rtedge was using a triplet of ints, rt/liboptical used/uses a triplet of floats! .. this caused the set command struct parse variable setting to not work quite as was intended... resulting in the background never changing from black.  this fixes the problem by reinstating rtedges global int triplet but lets call it bgcolor now.. (addresses sf bug 1172633)  should probably make rtedge do what rt does eventually.
