fixed rtedge/rtwizard background render failure bug where the -c set background option would not behave as expected (it seemingly did nothing).  the problem is related to different way rtedge deals with the background compared to rt -- rt uses a float triplet, rtedge was trying to use an int triplet.  code changes from some time ago made all background modifiers use liboptical's (float triplet) global, which resulted in the bug.  the int triplet was reinstated, though rtedge should probably be modified to do what rt does.  this fixes sf bug 1172633.
