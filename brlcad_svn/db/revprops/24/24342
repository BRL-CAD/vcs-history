Rename librt's mk_binunif function to rt_mk_binunif and add a
mk_binunif interface to libwdb.  The libwdb interface supports reading
from either a file or from data already loaded into memory.  Since the
count needed for the memcpy, we also modify the binunif to accept a
value count so that we know how many values to read from either memory
or disk (partial file loading, for example).
