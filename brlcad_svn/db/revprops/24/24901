* Fixed the rendering weirdness on the slave start-up
  Slaves were requesting a work unit right after prep begins
  so that slaves were holding onto a work unit for a lengthy time
  until prep finished and causing the units to not get done until
  prep finished.
* Added compute nodes status to observer.
* Added Scale Factor status to observer.
* Changed bytes transfered to mibi bytes instead of kilobytes.
