no answer from bob so rerevert the size arguments to rt and rtcheck so that the defaults are used.  there was a problematic case where depending on the order/type of your args in mged,  you could not override the default.  regardless, less overlap sneaks through the cracks with the more dense grid even if at the expense of a little run-time delay.  was there another reason for setting the sizes explicitly?
