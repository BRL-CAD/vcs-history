apply patch for CAN-2005-2096 aka SA15949 aka DSA-740-1 aka RHSA-2005:569 aka GLSA 200507-05 (original identifier) addressing a potential vulnerability whereby an attacker could construct a malformed data stream, embedding it within network communication or an application file format, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code when decoded by the application using the zlib library.
