major reworking of the benchmark to iteratively double the number of rays being fired until the individual test requires takes at least a minimum predetermined amount of wallclock time (currently set to 60 seconds per test).  the number of rays is doubled via hypersampling 1+N hypersample rays with jitter disabled.  the amount of time may be specified via the TIMEFRAME environment variable.  having the longer run time will help the rtfm numbers stabilize better and lets the benchmark scale better to faster machines.  an interesting addition for the future might be to compute the mean error deviation between frames and use that as well to get a stable rtfm metric.
