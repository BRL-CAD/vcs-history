Shazam.  This makes a fairly extensive improvement (pretty much a rewrite) of rtarea to report both the presented and exposed area projections for both regions and assemblies.  The regions are sorted alphabetically, the assemblies are indented by maximum encountered visitation depth (which isn't the same as the construction hierarchy, but good enough for organizing the list somewhat), and the number of hits are reported as well.  more work is needed to alphabetize the assembly levels as well as reduce some of the code duplication.
