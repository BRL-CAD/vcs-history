woosh! a complete rewrite of the brl-cad location routine.. bu_brlcad_path is now quite deprecated, being replaced by bu_brlcad_data and bu_brlcad_root depending on wheter you are looking for data resources or not.  the routines presently no longer bomb and search with quite a bit more methodology than before.  for bu_brlcad_root, the search order is now BRLCAD_ROOT environment variable then BRLCAD_ROOT compile-time path then /usr/brlcad then current dir.  for bu_brlcad_path, the search order is now BRLCAD_DATA environment variable then BRLCAD_DATA compile-time path then bu_brlcad_root/share/brlcad/VERSION then bu_brlcad_root/share/brlcad then bu_brlcad_root then ./src then current dir.  this separation allows for a fully-integrated system installation.
