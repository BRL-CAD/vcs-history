Incorporated Janine's comments.  Much more readable now.
Editors are really wonderful people to have around!
Broke with the g_lint tradition of specifying reports as a bit mask.
The user community really doesn't know the first thing about binary
these days, so we shouldn't mandate they learn about it to work with
the user interface (even a command-line user interface).
