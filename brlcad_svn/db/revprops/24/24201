add output messages for the tcl/itcl functionality checks to know why it fails if it fails at run-time.  improve the itcl functionality check by decoupling the test from libtcl symbols -- this will let configure find a useable incrtcl even if the version of tcl/tk is too old (e.g. 8.3).  finally, make tk build again..
