Refined production of plot output into individual files.
Built test cases for each analysis type.
Added -p command line option to suppress (default) or produce plot files.
Banged head against keyboard until units were reported correctly.
Gave up on making floating point values average correctly.
Cleaned up output to always (I think) report the user specified units.
