When the root finder rt_poly_findroot cannot find roots, it now tells you the name of the primitive.
This is not always an error.  Frequently, this results from a ray grazing the primitve.  However, it is
reasonable for the user to want to know and examine the primitive, and asses the impact on the analysis
being performed.
