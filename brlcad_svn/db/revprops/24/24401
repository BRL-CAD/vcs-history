refactor the benchmarks into a functional form to ensure consistency across all the tests as the testing becomes more complicated (e.g. for adding variance/deviation checks and superscaling).  this should be posix shell compliant, hopefully most all platform /bin/sh these days are minimally compliant too.  function form happens to shave a couple hundred lines off the file too.. ;)
