make sure the command list is initialized before attempting to add an entry.  if cmdInit() has some step that fails for any particular reason, it returns early.  this was causing the crash (for example when incrtcl or incrtk failed to locate their startup script) and probably should be rethought, though the 'broken install' case is rather abnormal and unsupported.
