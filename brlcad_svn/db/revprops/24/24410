add variance/deviation checks to the benchmarks so that after we reach a minimum timeframe per run, it may continue rendereing extra frames until the numbers on the performance results of the last run are within some deviation percentage of the average previous N frames.  initial testing shows that this results in a MUCH more stable/repeatable rtfm than before.
