add a -f option to mged to prevent it from automatically detaching on startup -- this is often very useful for logging or debugging.  also, make the backgrounding notice wait until the gui is up and running before exiting instead of sleeping an arbitrary amount of time -- the child notifies the parent when the gui is up.
