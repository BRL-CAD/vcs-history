get rid of the duplicate automake hacking and just resolve to use AM_MAINTAINER_MODE for now.  would also like no-dependencies but have not figured out how to dynamically set that option without causing vast troubles.  (including AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE multiple times is apparently buggy for at least several versions of automake resulting in incorrect expansions in the resultant configure script (aclocal- problem)).
