rework the horrid attribute value getter func yet again, semi reverting back to the version that allocates all of the memory up front.  there's something preventing the incremental allocation from going through cleanly right now that should probably be debugged at some point.. allocating up front probably only works because it blows away any existing contents (whereas the incremental wouldn't) implying that something isn't initialized by the time it gets here.

END
