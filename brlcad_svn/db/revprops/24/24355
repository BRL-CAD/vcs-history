glXCreateContext might not be able to make a direct context, so don't presume that it will.  if it's not, we need to turn on the multiple_windows flag so that the context is properly acquired/released.  this fixes a bus error crash on the macs, as well as other oddities on some other platforms.  this is possibly related to sf bug 925427 where the entire X display would go black until the raytrace completes.
