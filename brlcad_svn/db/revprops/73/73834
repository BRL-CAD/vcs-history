Start experimenting to see whether we can use the triangulation information at the very beginning of the refinement process to get the edges into a sufficiently refined state that after this point the processing can keep things valid at all stages, instead of trying to refine sufficiently to clear a bad state.  If we can, let's get over any such hurdles immediately, early in the refinement process.
