add some input parameter checking to rt_pos_flag() if it's going to be a function called in typein.c; rename RT_ANNOT_POS defines to RT_TXT_POS since they're not specific to annotations (they're specific to txt_seg objects, which also need to be renamed but can be done later along with the other _seg API.).
