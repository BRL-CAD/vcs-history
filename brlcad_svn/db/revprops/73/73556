Start thinking through how to build the initial loop.  This is the core of the problem that was never solved with the trimesh based logic - how to guarantee a valid p2t outer loop when the mesh topology is known to be incorrect.  Previously we just tried to suck in enough triangles that we ended up with inputs that worked, but a sparse triangle set proved we can't ignore it.  What we really need to do is work with the local connectivity information we *do* have from the mesh, starting at the problem points, and grow out until we have a viable loop.  Once we do have such a loop there are other concerns (whether the interior points are contained, self intersection if we need to grow out further and how to incorporate new bad triangles encountered during growth) but an initial valid loop must be the core from which we start.
