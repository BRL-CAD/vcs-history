Need to use the Brep normals here to guide us - one of the reasons we're in this logic in the first place is that the triangle directions aren't correct according to the Brep normals.  Check face NIST2 face 308 (tol norm 10) - getting single triangle sets to process, which seems weird...  maybe shouldn't be using singularity point normals for this?
