Dredge up the previous filter-branch attempt and tweak it with the commit-filter suggestion.  Untested, and since we'll be doing one final run anyway to correct multiple issues it's not needed currently, but it would be a useful thing to demonstrate on the previous test commit as a proof of concept to know we CAN do it successfully if we have to.
