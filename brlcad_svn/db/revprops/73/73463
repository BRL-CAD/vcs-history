Hmm.  Apparently listing *all* git commits isn't as simple as I thought it was.  The archived tags representing 'deleted' branches are a particular problem.  This was a hair raiser as it looked like the git conversion was dropping large swaths of commits - a couple spot checks done via checking out archived tags and looking at their git logs find 'missing' commits, but we still don't know for sure everything is there and until we find a better way to get a full log of all git commits (including in tag histories) it's going to complicate a systematic audit.
