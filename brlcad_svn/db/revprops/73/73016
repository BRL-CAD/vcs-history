Doesn't build - init.c doesn't seem to see the pragma and produces a C2341 error.  (Probably related - for some reason 'read' in the pragma is producing an "unexpected identifier '_read'" warning, but not sure why since this is common to all the online examples.)  Beyond the build issue, we may have a looming problem with VS2015 release builds (which we need) breaking this mechanism, based on the glib project's experience with this...
