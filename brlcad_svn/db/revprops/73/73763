this enables ray tracing of non-solid NURBS geometry.

instead of letting shotlines with non-even parity hit counts return
nothing, we now returns all intersection points encountered.  this has
the intended affect of always allowing NURBS geometry to render while
still having no LOS contribution towards analyses.

more bits are needed to not give a false sense of solidity, namely
that non-solid geometry is reported as such during import and marked
as plate-mode or rejected, for example.

one unintended discovery is I'm seeing non-even parity hits on solid
geometry (e.g., nist #1).  will need to be investigated as now those
previously rejected hits (presumably edge grazings) will now report
zero-thickness hits.  this can introduce flipped normal reporting
where there previously was none if we graze on a back-facing surface
edge.
