Working on a serialization/deserialization of the key cdt_mesh information so we can snapshot a face mesh that fails and debug it in isolation instead of trying to get to reproduce and break correctly in a larger run - latter is difficult even when the problem is repeatable, and at least some of the time the randomization makes repetition difficult.
