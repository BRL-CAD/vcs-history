Use https://github.com/DevHwan/RTree rather than the openNURBS version - for whatever reason, that one is slightly easier for me to understand.  Stash the edge segments directly.  It's not building the tree for all faces for some reason, but on those faces where it is the results are looking like what I would expect.
