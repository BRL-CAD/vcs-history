Pull a routine for best fit plane calculation from the old bot2nurbs code and make it a libbn function.  It used Eigen, so for now just put Eigen back in as the simplest way forward, but eventually may want to look at refactoring SVDLIBC https://github.com/lucasmaystre/svdlibc to provide this capability without having to pull in Eigen.
