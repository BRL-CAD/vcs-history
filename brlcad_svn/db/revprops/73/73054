This is a (hopefully temporary) revert of r73012, with some rework as well (semchk tries to check all files not just headers for semaphore definitions, PM and TIE semahpores have been consolidated into the librt list).  Once r73012 is working reliably on Windows this should be reverted again to restore the improved semaphore system.
