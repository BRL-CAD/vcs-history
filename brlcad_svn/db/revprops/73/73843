Do a test on the post initialization polygons to see if we can get a valid face from the sparse inputs.  If not, split the longer edges until we can.  In a sense, this is similar to the inital breakdown of closed loops and always splitting curved edges at least once (probably should be at least twice, really - squares in place of circles is a jarring visual) in that we need to do this refinement regardless of how liberal the tolerance settings are in order to be able to return something valid.  Have the rest of the processing turned off for now - need to hammer out each stage and build on it.  The repair logic can mask problems earlier in the chain, which we don't want - repair is a last resort after everything else has been done right.
