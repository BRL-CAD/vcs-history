canonicalize_file_name doesn't actually seem to be an improvement on realpath.  Embed OpenBSD's userland implementation of realpath and use it.  Right now it's replacing all system realpath implementations when realpath is detected (so basically everywhere except Windows) because I haven't been able to come up with a reliable configure-time test that will detect the stack smash issue libbu realpath unit test #2 trips over.
