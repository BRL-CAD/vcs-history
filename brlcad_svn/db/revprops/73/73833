Not sure this is really necessary, but use point-in-polygon test to pre-cull points outside the outer loop or inside the inner trimming loops before handing off for triangulation.  poly2tri may handle this itself correctly, but a couple of planar triangulation oddities make me wonder enough to want to try an extra culling step.
