be more explicit and develop commonality regarding what criteria are considered during code reviews.  drop the previous notes that were riddled with subjective criteria and inconsistent wording.  here I introduce testable binary criteria in an affirmative checklist form that can be evaluated against most if not all changes.  this is intended to be particularly useful for new contributors.  it's also intended to be a living document that will change over time, but that will also help standardize our code review practice too (so feedback from other devs is of course welcome).
