The 2D plot looks right when we go this route, but the cylinder is twisted in 3D.  I'm wondering if adding the surface points will fix this - with a reversed trim, the closest edge point in 2D for the triangulation is in fact the one that is further away in 3D, and the edges near the linear edge split are slightly better...
