Whether from limitations in the svnfexport parsing or the original SVN data itself (or both), there are a fair number of commits doing merge work (per the commit message) that aren't getting a merge line in their git commit.  Throw together a quick and dirty audit tool to run on the commit files to give us a set to check and (if appropriate) hand add the correct merge line.
