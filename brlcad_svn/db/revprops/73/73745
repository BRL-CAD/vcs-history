patch #531 (https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/531/) from ali haydar: a bug in l command when used on the annotation primitive
when we use the l command for an annotation the text label is not printed if it was more than one letter I think the reason is the inconsistent behavior between the exporting and the importing operation of the primitive
