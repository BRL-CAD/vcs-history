a long-standing source of usability and productivity issues, make the rt tools no longer create images with 0444 (read-only) permissions.  renderings are rarely ver sacred immutable items that took hours or days to render any more, so they can typically be easily recreatd.  this change does mean that we may want to make rt require a flag to overwrite an existing complete rendering, but rtedge wouldn't necessarily due to overlay feature.
