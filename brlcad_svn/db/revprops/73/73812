Associating the edge segments with the trims isn't working reliably - some segments seem to be referencing deleted edges.  I'm still not completely sure why that wasn't working - a trim shouldn't survive to reference an obsolete edge container, so it may be an indication of a bookkeeping problem somewhere...  For now, just go with using the trim information directly.  Slightly less than ideal if the trims are far from the edge when building 3D rtrees - boxes will have to be expanded enough to be sure we're capturing the needed locality.
