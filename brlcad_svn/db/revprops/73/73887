This may not be the right approach - might be better to go with inserting local points based on the trim bboxes, then just doing the surface breakdown and rejecting at the end any points inside either the trim bboxes or bboxes defined around the trim-inserted points.  Need to experiment with whether inserting points near trims from their bboxes is workable.
