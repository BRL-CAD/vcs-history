If we want the polygon to be robust to degenerate edge manipulations, we have to act on ordered rather than unordered edges.  Repair situations preclude this happening by always starting with a triangle, but face loops may begin (in the early stages of splitting) with degenerate edges.  The cylinder with a closed loop edge was getting a 0-1 and 1-0 edges, which needed to be distinct for subsequent splitting but were the same when converted to an unordered edge.  We want the unordered insertion for robustness in repair situations, where we may need to walk over odd edges, but for face loop building our ordering is constrained by the loop itself.  Add API to the polygon that lets us bypass the unordering portion of the edge insertion/removal logic for this case.
