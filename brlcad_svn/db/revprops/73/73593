Start working through the mechanics of triangle addition and removal.  At least initially the thought is to update all the boundary edge information after every single triagnle operation, so we can debug what each triangle add/remove does to the mesh at need.  Watching the plots after each operation, we should see the non-brep boundary edge sets grow and shrink.
