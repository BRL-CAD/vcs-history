the artificial trimming of the argc being passed to bu_opt_parse isn't right when there aren't any input/output options, resulting in a negative number that becomes a huge positive size_t, and crashes.  it's not completely clear what the intent was, but the correct thing to do should be unadulterated passage to bu_opt_parse.  start hiding all the local functions too.
