Checkpoint an attempt to recognize the self-intersecting edge segments in the polygon when that happens and prioritize adding associated triangles for those edges, in an effort to 'walk clear' of the self-intersecting region via growth.  Not working yet - seeing an occasional stack smash, so something's definitely wrong somewhere, but haven't found it yet.
