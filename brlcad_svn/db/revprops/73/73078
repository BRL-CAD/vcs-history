Restore the new semaphore registration system, this time utilizing a
different initialization method that should work universally including
Windows.  Now relies on C++ static object initialization and one tiny
feature from C++11 to make semaphore registration parallel threadsafe.

This version now also cleans up the semaphore allocations when done
too via destructor.  All tests pass on Windows and Linux.  Code could
use a little cleanup, but looking well on the whole hilarity.
