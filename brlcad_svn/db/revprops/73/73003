Hopefully this will be the last major refactor of this logic... Setting things up to use broken out 'template' files which can be hand edited, and in the case of the commit information allow use of revision numbers and branch names which are converted automatically at run time into sha1 strings.  In principle this should allow for the automation of the deleteall + fulltree process currently being done manually on most revision validation failures.  We're getting more of those as we get towards more modern commits with more advanced svn syncing, and it's too time/labor intensive to keep having to do that manually.  Also, need to be able to 'replay' the full process with a minimum of intervention if a problem is found in the early svn commits, so hopefully this will allow that to happen cleanly.  Some more work to do and quite a bit more testing needed, but checkpointing as most of the fundamental restructure should now be in place.
