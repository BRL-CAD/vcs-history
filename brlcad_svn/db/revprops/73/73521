That's it - one too many times getting irritated by poor random color choices.  Create a version of the step-g golden ratio color generator Keith did in step-g as an option to a bu_color_rand function.  Take advantage of C++11 to keep the random color bit in libbu instead of lifting it to libbn - much cleaner to keep it with the other color logic, and as long as the colors vary to some degree it's not critical to control the details of how the random subsystem works.
