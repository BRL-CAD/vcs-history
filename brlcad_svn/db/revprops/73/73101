debugged this for a few hours and isolated the behavior down to occulsion object handling.  appears to not occlude properly, including the stored reference being wrong, and the failures are just differences in platforms picking different pixels to occlude.  could be a different object ordering bug of some sort.  also noticed the -c set command is sensitive to how the oo= list is quoted, ignoring the last object depending on how it's passed -- this seems unrelated to the regress bug, but affects direct testing comparisons.
