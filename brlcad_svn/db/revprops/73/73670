SMALL_FASTF is too small - was letting singularities mess with the values.  Also, getting a side effect on the mesh by always capping at max_edge - if I keep this it needs to move out of involves_trims, since it's unexpected just due to calling that, but it does have the result of avoiding large triangles in the mesh...  Also, BN_TOL_DIST may be too big for very small models - might need to base that value on the overall brep bbox size.
