Add a list of commits that (in a dry-run configuration) generated git commit fi files without a merge line, but look like they should have one per commit msg inspection.  Will have to manually tweak these to at least try to point to some of the relevant merge info - won't be perfect in all cases, and this probably misses some where the msg didn't provide enough of a clue, but hopefully better than nothing.
