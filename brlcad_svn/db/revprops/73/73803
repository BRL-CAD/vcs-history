Let the loop close the polygon.  This exposes an oddity where remove_edge corrupts the working memory of the parent polygon container when there's only one edge present, but haven't run that to ground yet... valgrind isn't seeing anything and it will work successfuly in valgrind.  For the moment, disable the deletion of the culled edge.
