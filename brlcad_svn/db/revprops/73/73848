The refinement of edges has to be paired with surface sampling, or we quickly get into unworkable territory.  NIST7 Solid1.s won't quite work even in this basic mode because of a corner meeting that produces an inconvenient triangle.  That problem gets heightned drastically when we sample more deeply.  Need to look carefully at surface sampling to make sure density near edges is adequate.
