Introduce (in parallel for testing) versions of the 2D convex hull routines that return indices into the original point array rather than a new point array.  We want this to allow for simplier recognition of when two points are the 'same' in more complex processing.  This integer index return style will eventually replace the current polyline and trimesh functions, but we will also want bg_polyline_gc and bg_trimesh_gc routines before that happens to make it trivial for callers to take the outputs of these functions and construct outputs with just the 'active' points and adjusted indices for final export to .g shapes.  That book-keeping shouldn't live in multiple places - it's too easy to get subtly wrong.
