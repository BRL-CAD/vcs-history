prevent burst from crashing if provided no options, displays usage.  it's not clear what the intended behavior is supposed to be now that there is no longer an interactive prompt, but the tool doesn't seem to be in a usable or intuitive state..  made it go into an interactive command mode if provided -p without a file, but there doesn't seem to be built-in help or discovery commands (which presumably were presented via text UI menu previously).  needs to be reconciled with the manual page.
