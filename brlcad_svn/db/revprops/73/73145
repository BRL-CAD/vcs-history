power5 regression failures are confirmed, icv's dpix support is implemented without endianness consideration.  it traces back to Sue's original implementation of dpix-pix back in 1990.  need to write out dpix in big endian network form, read back to native, like is one for geometry.  note this isn't user visible as dpix was never documented (or completed).
