Yep, a blind alley.  An interesting capability (although it looks like there's at least one bug hidden in the current setup) but not one that will give us what we need for this application - we need to recreate the 3D bounding polyon in the projection with correct loop ordering, and the concave hull is not well defined enough to give us that.  Version control has it if we find it potentially useful in the future.
