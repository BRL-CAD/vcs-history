If I'm correctly interpreting https://stackoverflow.com/a/24940131 the 'logb' wrapper for getting branch-only history can only work as far back as the last merge - git itself doesn't preserve the information it would need to (for example) give a full history of just the commits made to the cmake branch.  As a possible way around this (at least for the svn history - it obviously won't work going forward with git) use the note mechanism to record not just the revision number but also the commit branch.  It's not an absolutely accurate transcription - we're using the git branch name which is occasionally different than the svn name (trunk vs. master, for example) but it should suffice to preserve the information and hopefully allow a script to reassemble the branch history more or less the way subversion would have, at least for the post CVS portion of the history.  It may be possible in principle to do something similar with the CVS portion of the history, piggybacking off the commit message mapping, but at least at this point I'm going to pass.  The logb trick will show unmerged branch history, and we should be able to re-generate the notes later if we end up needing pre-SVN branch-only histories.  At the moment I'm thinking well-behaved, per-file history is likely to be good enough.
