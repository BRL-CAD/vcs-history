Manage the trim-contributed surface points separately from the those sampled in the surface breakdown.  Be more aggressive about rejecting points anywhere near trims, since the trim-contributed points (which were actually being culled reliably by the 3D edge segment check, unsurprsingly in retrospect) are there specifically to handle those regions of the surface.  Also plug the bbox 'holes' in the 2D polygon loop trees by adding boxes around the edge points.  Should probably still do the same thing for 3D, but this is looking better.
