wonderful.  looks like possibly the cause of the spurious parallelism failures I was observing.  it means the last semaphore will be potentially unitialized/unallocated memory, which is particularly catastrophic on optimized builds.  this means bu_hash semaphore locking is hozed, which affects even non-parallel usage including ged 'select' command, drawing in archer, prep caching, and anything that does a dirbuild.  unit testing failed to catch this because it uses BU_SEM_LAST too.
