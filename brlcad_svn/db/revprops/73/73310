Call singular surface function to set up for testing.  Also accidentally corrected a problem with the bookkeeping which may have accounted for the original issue that prompted starting the singularity handling.  Not going to abandon just yet since this is essentially the same logic that will be needed for any localized mesh operations not involving a full re-CDT of the face, but not clear yet how critical it is.
