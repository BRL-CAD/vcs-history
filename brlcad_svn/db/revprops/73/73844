Split curved edges an additional time so we don't end up with square circles.  Interestingly, with NIST2 this one refinement introduces a need for repairs to a number of faces, not due to a topologically invalid output but rather due to triangles on the edges that end up at right angles to the face.  That situation was originally observed in sparse sampling and has a much higher probability in this testing (since surface point sampling is currently off) than in normal mesh sampling, but at least for NIST2 the repair logic appears able to deal with it even working only with edge points.
