first steps on feature request from josh baker (scr 2793) to change the default mged key bindings.  this eliminates a long-standing source of new user confusion when they accidentally press x/y/z and send their model spinning uncontrollably (not knowing that 0 stops it.  escape was mysteriously never set to stop it too.).  here I eliminate the default key bindings for xXyYzZ0 and extend Escape to stop rotations just for good measure.  the knob command is left intact so behavior is still available.
