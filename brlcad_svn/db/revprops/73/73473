This is an incredibly ugly unoptimized hack, but it does let me see which face triangle meshes are along a line of site in the scene.  The right way to do this would be to properly raytrace the nurbs faces and report using that, but at a glance our API isn't currently set up to easily allow reporting individual opennurbs ON_Brep face data in a brep.  This uses the not-ready-for-prime-time mesh generation (which is what I want it to debug in the first place) and plows through things triangle by triangle, doing a full CDT for each face from scratch.  Needs to be yanked out as soon as the CDT work is wrapped unless it is substantially cleaned up and redesigned. The one and only point in its favor is that it worked.  It let me identify face 264 in NIST2 as the face I wanted to look at, and did so more easily (sans coding time) than manually bisecting with the brep face plotting routines.
