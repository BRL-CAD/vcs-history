Checkpoint an experiment - rather than using the normals from the surface, look at the distance of the midpoints from the edge curves in the outer curve. Then, iff we need to, evaluate the midpoints on the edges of spatch and check the distance of the midpoint of the surface patch from those lines against the largest of the similar distances from the curved edges.  In essense, we're letting the curve breakdown handle the resolution of how 'smooth' to make things and then having the surface match the results of the edge breakdown.
