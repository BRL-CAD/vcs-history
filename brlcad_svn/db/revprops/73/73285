remove the corefoundation method for finding the system cache directory since it's adequately covered by a plain C method.  additionally, as the corefoundation method relied on objective-c, this is problematic with gcc-9 (e.g., homebrew or self-install) compilation as it still does not yet implement Modern Objective-C, thus slew of errors result when simply including the foundation header.
