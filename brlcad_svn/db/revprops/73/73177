Getting closer.  Curved edges on surfaces curved in more than one dimension look problematic - the edge splitting doesn't know about finer splitting of the surface driven by the other dimension's curvature, and we're ending up with coarse edge curves when we need finer ones.  Not sure yet how to approach - maybe some sort of adjacent face characterization during edge processing?
