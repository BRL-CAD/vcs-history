patch #534 (https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/534/) from ali haydar: a bug due to the new ant_label_dimensions() function
reviewing the committed code I found this bug which breaks the whole drawing operation of the primitive, the initialization of the bu_list is not correct so its magic is zero so bn_vlist_2string() function will not work
