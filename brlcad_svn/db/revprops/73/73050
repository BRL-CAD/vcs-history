generalize from errata to ammendments as we may update a release posting for reasons other than fixing something, it's just a small change of some sort.  make the trigger point for ammendments even more explicit as they should be minimized as much as possible.  this is because they cause a workflow outside of the usual release process with a number of manual steps not well documented (like uploading release notes with patch update instructions).  they're should not be required when the release steps were not fully completed which includes tagging, upload, and announcement among other steps.
