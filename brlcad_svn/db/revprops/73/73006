Put a compile-time measure in place to guard against errors in the *_SEM_* definitions used by bu_parallel such as the one I introduced in 72600.  I've almost made similar mistakes in the past, and per Sean's 73001 fix the run-time results of getting this wrong are potentially both subtle/quirky and very problematic.  This should make it much harder to mess up, and semchk.cxx can be further enhanced if more checks are needed.
