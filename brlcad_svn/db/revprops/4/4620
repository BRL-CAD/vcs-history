Made two changes: changed the grid size output format to %f to preserve
a decimal point even for integers.  The client codes need the decimal
point in order to get the grid size correct.  Also changed the component
count on the last line from 1 to 0, since it is possible to have a valid
shotline of the sort listed there is there is one component for that
shotline.  Apparently, a lot of the client codes key more on the zero
component than on the 999.99's on the last line.
