The screen coordinates have now been converted to model space coordinates.
Caveat: the plot must be rotated to the same az./el. it was raytraced
at in order to look intelligible.  However, all the coordinates and the
distances are accurate.
The next task should be to optionally allow the plot to be viewed "looking"
right.... this will require the coordinates to lose their accuracy.
Also, it is necessary to allow the user to specify the cosine of the angle
between surface normals below which he wishes no shading to occur.
