Added the appropriate calls to mged for the personal iris and
the 4D 240Gt machines to work with depthcueing.  The problem was we
were using some of the old routines such as RGBrange instead of the
newer and supported routes such as lRGBrange, lshaderange.. etc.
I tried it on both a personal iris and a 240GTX machine
