Now, protocol.h has a define for the maximum number of pixels
that can be assigned.
Fixed bug with leaving a single CPU spinning when dispatcher
vanishes abruptly.  Was due to the libpkg error handler being
pointed to rt_log().  rt_log() would call pkg_suckin(), which
would go to the error handler (rt_log), which would deadlock
in RES_ACQUIRE, due to the recursion.
