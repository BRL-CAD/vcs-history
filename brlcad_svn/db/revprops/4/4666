This version has been validated as operating correctly
(or, at least operating in the same way as the previous version),
for all the databases in /m/cad/db, with these caveats:
1)  the axis of the torus ABCD vectors has rotated 45 degrees.
    Makes the same torus, but the numbers are different.
2)  Unused entires for sphere, polygon, etc, are zeroed now.
3)  c_num and m_num forced to zero.
4)  Current working units from last MGED session are not brought along.

END
