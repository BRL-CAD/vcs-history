Sync dm-work efforts through 62497, plus fix to tclcad_obj.c from 62580, into trunk.  This is the 'hide dm and fb' effort.  In order to make this work in trunk, we need to temporarily rework the updates to still allow struct dm and struct fb to be part of the public API so code explicitly accessing struct members can still do so (that mechanism will go away after 7.26).  Rather than compliate this commit with those struct changes, they will be done in a follow-on commit.
