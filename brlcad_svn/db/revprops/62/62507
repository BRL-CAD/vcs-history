Modified several OpenNURBS surface routines EvPoint(),Ev1Der(),Ev2Der() and EvNormal() to check for and unwrap any u,v that extends outside of the surface domain. This forces the u,v back into the surface domain ensuring correct surface point/normal/derivative evaluations. This supports a feature we added that allows trims to extend outside of the domain and cross over closed seams. This feature can be preprocessed in/out with the "BRLCAD_FEATURE_EXTEND_UV_OVER_CLOSED_SEAMS" compile definition. This definition is added to the openNURBS build by enabling the flag  "BRLCAD_ENABLE_OPENNURBS_EXTENSIONS". This flag is enabled by default.
