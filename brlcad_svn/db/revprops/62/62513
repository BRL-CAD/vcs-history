wow, old masked bug.  rt_init_resource only conditionally initializes various lists within the resource structure, so this assumes that the entire structure starts out as zero.  just declaring the array does not zero-initialize, so we were getting only partially initialized resources undoubtedly causing random bad behavior with just the right start-up memory and cpus.
