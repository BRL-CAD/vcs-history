Take a step towards hiding all the backend specific bits in fb_private.h - major problem looks to be the *_open_existing functions.  Those are a problem, because the fundamental issue is going to be hard to hide - namely, that creating embedded windows is inherently specific to each platform.  Not even clear we can pass all the responsibility to the parent, since low level drawing may have to know platform specific details.
