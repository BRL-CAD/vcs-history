Having gone that far with the merge back into trunk from dm-work, we might as well go the rest of the way.  This is mostly reworking the display_list/solid list handling as a preliminary to shifting the low-level details down the stack and ideally out of the applications.  The freesolid list has been restored, although it is no longer a global in either MGED or libged.
