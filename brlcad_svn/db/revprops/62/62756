Somewhere in here (probably should be in do_event rather than the poll function itself) we seem to need to update the OSG viewer frame to recover from drawing damage when the window is hidden.  fbserv has an odd setup where it has hardcoded WIN32 and non-WIN32 timing values for calling fb_poll - need to make that a recommendation from the fb implementation via a callback.  The non-WIN32 default (60 seconds??) is far too slow for any sort of interactive updating - it only works with ogl because the X window used there handles repainting without needing to call fb_poll.
