what recursive bu_parallel was all for ... now we can prep an individual object in parallel.  the pattern demonstrated here with brep translates to potential gains in other parts of the code, but this is a particular hot spot for some brep models.   commit this debug (but seemingly working) version here with debug printing/timings enabled while more tests are run with different geometries.
