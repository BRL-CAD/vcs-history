Merge in all libbu changes and related tweaks from dm-work@r62639 to trunk, and make local alterations to trunk code to work with the libbu changes.  The new magic numbers are harmless, as is the bu_struct_parse change if NULL is passed for the new parameter.  Right now these updates aren't in use by any code in trunk, but they help reduce the size of the diff between the branches.
