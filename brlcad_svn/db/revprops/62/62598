Added function PointInPolygon() based off of private function found in clipper library that is used to determine if point is inside of a  polygon.  Also added ShiftInnerLoops() that is called from poly2tri_CDT()'s  closed surface checking routine to make sure holes don't need shifted across a closed seam so that they are inside of the outer polygon.
