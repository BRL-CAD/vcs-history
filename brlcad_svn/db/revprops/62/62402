Until the correct solution to the poly2tri issue is found, put back r62383 - it at least doesn't wipe out in the case were the default poly2tri code does, even if the fix isn't the right one.  When work begins for the right fix, if poly2tri changes are needed (or if we can revert to vanilla poly2tri) this directory should be backed up to r60023 as a starting point.
