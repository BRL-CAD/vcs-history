Ugly, but get dg.h and friends out of the BRL-CAD libraries.  To keep mged working, stuck a hacked up wdb_obj in with src/mged to define the Tcl commands.  This will need a fair bit of cleanup to be tolerable, but it serves the immediate need of not wanting to retrofit any display list bits in the deprecated dg.h logic.
