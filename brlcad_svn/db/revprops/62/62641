Remove dg.h and friends, per dm-work branch commit 62532.  Things to note - this removes the old gdiff tool - while the new one should functionally do what is needed, testing and user feedback are in order.  Also mged gets a modified wdb_obj.c stuffed into it to define its tcl commands until someone can come in and clean that up properly.
