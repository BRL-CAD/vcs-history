All right - if we're going to keep poly2tri separate as opposed to eventually merging it into BRL-CAD's libs (and the work the bitfighter folks are doing combining clipper and poly2tri suggests that's a good idea) then we shouldn't be ripping out references for pointers.  We need another way to make the error cases do something other than bring down the application.
