Make a note of the 32 bit build options for X11+OpenSceneGraph+Apple - need to handle setting OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM automatically as part of a broader 'drawing system' toplevel variable...  In theory, both Windows and Mac *might* want an X11 build, and if Wayland gains more momentum there will be multiple choices even on Linux...
