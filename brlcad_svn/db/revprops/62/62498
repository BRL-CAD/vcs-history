reverse merge c62403 to restore jon's new eval logic that aims to consolidate tcl evals through one routine (so we can capture all output to the tcl console correctly).  there is a problem in archer with this version where wireframes appear horked.  in fact, they're not .. the adaptive wireframe code is simply being told to render to a 1x1 display context, so it comes out looking quite chunky.  fix in following.
