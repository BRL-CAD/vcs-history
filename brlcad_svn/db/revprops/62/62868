Rather than adding back in the getcwd hack, add the build directory plugin path the right way.  Only need to do this when we're using viewers that might conceivably need plugins - the raw context drawing doesn't use them - but will need to do it everywhere such a viewer is created to have things 'just work' in the build dir.  To simplify the logic, don't have osg use a version number for the plugins dir - we're only building one version of osg for BRL-CAD at a time.
