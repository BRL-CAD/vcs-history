Set the stage for hiding the display manager's framebuffer inside the display manager, hiding the messy details from the toplevel.  It looks like the previously added dm_openFb slot in struct dm_internal might have been intended for this purpose, but ended up unused - we'll start using it for this.  X is the first to be hidden.
