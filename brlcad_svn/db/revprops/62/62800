Since we're not (yet) using the full-blown scene graph in the display manager, we need a portable OpenGL text solution that doesn't require scene graph nodes.  Start working on using fontstash together with the now explicitly MIT licensed ProFont ttf file to try and get portable text working.  This will need some fairly significant OpenGL state management to work (assuming it is viable at all) and right now it doesn't display anything coherent or in the right place, but it is a start so checkpointing.
