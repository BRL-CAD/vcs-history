Work towards completeing the 'ogl using openscenegraph' version of the dm/fb work with OpenSceneGraph - not done yet, but looking promising.  This approach treats OpenSceneGraph as a portable OpenGL context and uses the existing ogl dm and fb drawing code (for the most part), rather than leveraging the actual scene graph features of OSG (which is considerably more invasive.)  Adding this work for two reasons - 1) even though it is not a major functionality boost, it does have the potential to collapse the ogl and wgl dm/fb systems into a single, portable dm/fb and 2) it makes other efforts to actually use the scenegraph simplier from a changeset management perspective.  Controlled by the BRLCAD_ENABLE_OSG flag, which is off by default.
