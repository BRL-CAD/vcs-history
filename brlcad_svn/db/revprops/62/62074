Remove the fb_open_existing and fb_close_existing tcl commands - they don't appear to be used. If some sort of Tcl controls for this are needed, hopefully they can be set up in a way that requires less data to pass tough an argc/argv string interface - that's an ackward way to pass things like window pointers.  Once the new libdm intrfce is worked out, perhaps we can define a new fb_open_existing command via libdm or just have an fb command with subcommands.
