remove the statefulness.  the fpe handling isn't even consistently used since it was only enabled for non-parallel app contexts, but this also lets us eliminate all of the globals and stateful bu_is_parallel() calls.  if there are fpe issues, they should be dealt with here via logic checks (check for division by zero, etc).
