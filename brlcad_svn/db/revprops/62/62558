svn2git has reached the point where it's worth taking some trouble to ensure the svn2git tool itself remains available.  svn2git is not license compatible with BRL-CAD, which means it goes into misc as a utility-only tool and can't be merged with any BRL-CAD code.  CMakeify it so it's easier for those already familiar with BRL-CAD to build.
