Re-enable the hierarchy-first approach.  The difficulty was with LocalUnits::length, which is used for scaling in the hierarchy matrix build - the hierarchy logic was relying on the brep loop(s) to set the length and assuming that the local length is uniform for all objects.  This behavior is restored and hierarchy-first conversion now appears to be working, but we should look into doing a units lookup on a per-object basis during the hierarchy build so we can handle more complex situtations.
