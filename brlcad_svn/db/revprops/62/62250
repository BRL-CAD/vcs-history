fix the bu_semaphore unit test.  the test was trying to ensure that both threads actually made it into the parallel function, but the first thread was getting through too fast before the second thread could even test+set.  it also wasn't setting thread-safe so there was potential both would skip setting parallel=1.  now it spin loops the threads until a second process can get there to set parallel=1.
