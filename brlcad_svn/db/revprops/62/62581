Remove the FreeSolid global from libged, and update its behavior in MGED to match the new macros.  This doesn't allow for the re-use of memory for solid objects via a global list, and if that proves necessary for performance some sort of "display list object" memory pool will have to be set up, but the global needs to go if we're going to hide the solid-level manipulation successfully.
