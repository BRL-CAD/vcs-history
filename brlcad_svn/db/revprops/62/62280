significantly rework the semaphore api to no longer require explicit initialization.  we use static data to avoid library initialization statefulness and a common source of application dev frustration (parallel apps forgetting a bu_semaphore_init() resulted in obscure crashes and random behavior).  also, avoiding heap-allocated data makes memory management and cleanup more simple.  current semaphore limit is arbitrarily set at 1024 (two orders higher than our current known uses).
