The svn2git account-map and rules files mature to something approaching ready-for-prime-time.  Only thing that pops up in the catch-all 'unknown' repo currently is the /CVSROOT commits - not sure whether to go ahead and explicitly mark those as ignore or put them somewhere in the interests of full history presentation.  Need to study the created git repos to see how good they are, but definitely much closer than we've ever been to a high quality, fast git commit process.
