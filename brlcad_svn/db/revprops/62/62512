this fixes the gqa resource bug.  now bu_parallel() gives every thread of execution a unique ID *including* the parent bu_parallel() thread.  this means our index into a resource structure based on thread ID isn't the same or correct if #resources == #cpus.  need to think about this some to see if we can index more intelligently into resource arrays.
