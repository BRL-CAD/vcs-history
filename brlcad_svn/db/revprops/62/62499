this fixes the adaptive wireframe in archer.  to_is_viewable() needs to look at the tcl result object, so it needs to overwrite whatever was already there (and restore it just in case the caller needed that result).  this was messing with the display drawing code where calls to to_is_viewable() would interfere (causing the adaptive code to think it was drawing into a 1x1 display context).
