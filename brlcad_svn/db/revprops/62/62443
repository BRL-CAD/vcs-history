windows smp support is golden.  this is a test commit after editing the repository to forcibly and manually delete revisions 62443:62445 inclusive due to apparent repo corruption.  this replaes 62443 and may make existing checkouts (that were already updated to 62445) invalid.  the alternative is checkout redux.
