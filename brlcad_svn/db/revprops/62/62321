initial in-depth tracking of thread state with execution limits so recursive bu_parallel() invocations behave reliably and responsibly.  the intent is to have sub-invocations respect their parent context (no more than nthreads or the number of cores available), executing one child thread at a time until parent cpus/cores become available.  still tracing down the impl.
