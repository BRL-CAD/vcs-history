-* added blend mode. when writing into an existing fb, will try to make the
   edge line blend into the picture through some hsv magic. sorta like a
   tv network "bug". doesn't work very well yet.

-* added region color mode. edge colors are determined by the region material
   color. if an edge is between two or more regions, the nearer (lower hit
   dist) one is used.
