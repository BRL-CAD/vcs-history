-* Added per-cpu array of "pixel-is-an-edge" flags. These flags are used
   to control the fb_writes in overlay and blend modes. The old method
   of deciding whether to record or not--by comparing fg and bg--has been
   eliminated. The old method did not work reliably. It required the user
   to set the bg color manually when the extant framebuffer bg was not
   1/1/1.
