*- mods to vo_aet:
   * added -i for treating values incrementally
   * added support for values to be handed over
     as a vector or as single arguments
*- fixed misuse of Tcl_AppendResult (i.e. it was being
   used like printf, which is how it should have
   been implemented)
   On the other hand, since Tcl_AppendResult has been
   deprecated, any use of it is probably a misuse. :-)
