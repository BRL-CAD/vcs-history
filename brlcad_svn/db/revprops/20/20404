Bug fixes:
	the BU_AVS_FOR macro cannot be used on an empty AVS (I put "if" statements around its uses)
	bu_avs_add() was trying to increase the max entries by doing a *= (doesn't work for empty ones)
	bu_avs_add() was always calling bu_realloc() to get more memory (doesn't work for empty ones)

END
