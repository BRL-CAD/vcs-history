added performance modified versions of the identity and zero'ing matrix functions/macros in h/vmath.h and h/bn.h

all tests to date showed that there was no considerable increase in code size, and all compilers tested (gcc and irix cc on linux, irix, and freebsd) showed up to 6X speed increase and outperformed the alternatives regardless of optimization used.
