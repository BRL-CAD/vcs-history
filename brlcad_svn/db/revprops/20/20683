*- add two new TGC edit modes
	Set H,C,D - primarily sets H, then adjusts
		C and D so that the angles between
		the ends and the sides of the TGC
		are constant.
	Set H,A,B (move V) - same as above except moves V
		and adjusts A and B.
*- change the following items in the TGC edit menu:
	"Set c" ---> "Set C"
	"Set d" ---> "Set D"
