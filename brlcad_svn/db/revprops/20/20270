Added a cake clean to wipe out just pixcmp and *.o files for nfs benchmarkers who try to use the ./pixcmp tool

Updated run.sh to handle a lot more build cases and error conditions, plus the option to override settings with environment variables for RT, DB, and CMP
Thus, I can compare a remrt run to vger stats.
