Added GCC_WARNINGS define for verbose warnings when compiling with gcc and not building an optimized build.  Also fixed a long-standing Mac OS X static linkage problem where the system tcl/tk libraries would get in the way when using -L search paths.  Apple modified gcc's linkage so that dylibs are _always_ preferred over static libs if they exist (! grr).  Now the OS X build specified the archives directly when building static.
