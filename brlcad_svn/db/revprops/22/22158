Weee... Fixed the Linux thread cpu utilization bug.
Linux 2.4 has a kernal/library bug that prevents a parent thread from accumulating statistics
for child _threads_.  You can, however, compute statistics for a child _process_.  This patch
forks off prior to computation and then gathers statistics on that child process (which
properly includes the children thread cpu utilization).  A pipe is used to pass the multi-
cpu resources back to the parent process as the IPC communication mechanism.
