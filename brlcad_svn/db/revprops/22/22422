fix for macosX.3...
somehow, __APPLE_API_PRIVATE was getting set before an #include of select.h
which caused mach.h to be included from event.h (included from select.h).
mach.h happens to have a panic() function listed, and the tcl shtuff has
a #define panic (somecrap->something) which created a bad prototype in
/usr/include/sys/mach.h. Instead of tracking down where that define gets
set, I just forcefully undefine it before including select. Seems to work.
(shouldn't break other platforms...)
