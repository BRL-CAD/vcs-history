begin consolidating the in-memory-only database geometry support into one plcae.  move db_inmem() to its own db_inmem.c file, adding two new routines for opening/creating in-memory databases via db_open_inmem() and db_create_inmem().  difference between the two being that create adds a _GLOBAL while open does not.
