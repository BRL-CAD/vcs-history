begin efforts to port clone and tracker towards supporting v5 databases.  the db_getmrec() function and associated union records are v4 specific structures that don't apply to v5 so it basically needs to be reimplemented from scratch..  start by initializing all pointers to NULL and getting rid of the useless propagation of ClientData.
