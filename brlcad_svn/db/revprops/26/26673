prevent crashing mged when trying to draw extrude primitives that use empty sketch primitives.

simple statements like 'make x extrude' could cause this as well as using any (default) empty sketch.

the wireframe drawing routing was getting stuck in an infinite loop allocating memory adding empty vlist items to the mged display list due to the comparison against a negative decrementing index.

the code now checks for the empty sketch condition and informs the user. thanks to ValarQ for finding this bug.
