fairly comprehensive rewrite of tedit() for the ted command that merges the windows version in with the unix version in what should be a pretty platform independent manner.  this version tries a lot harder to find a usable editor other than /bin/ed including checking EDITOR even on Windows (there was some bug report for this, but can't find it atm).  it'll also kick off TextEdit on Mac OS X now as well as trying emacs and vi, before falling back on jove as the editor if it can find it.  still doesn't do run-time checking of the editor itself, but it should be more consistent.  also removed the closing of descriptors which lets console editors work and allows gui editors to be aborted
