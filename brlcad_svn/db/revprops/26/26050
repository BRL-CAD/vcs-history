now fully working, shooting rays at the remote geometry being held in-memory only.  finishing polish fixes that were needed include making the dbi_title memory dynamic so librt doesn't try to free the static string, do the something during the ciao instead of after the server shuts down, and MOST IMPORTANTLY .. don't free the libpkg buf buffer that was used to set the external buffer, that gets stashed into the directory pointer, that must not be free'd when we try to use it...(that took a long time to find)
