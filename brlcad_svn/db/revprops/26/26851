try enabling the automatic detection/compilation of tcl/tk now that tkCanvasBezier is cleaned up to not use internal Tk headers.  probably still need to work on Tcl autopath issues, but give it a shot.  also add a slew of checks for WGL so that a new framebuffer and display manager interface may be defined on Windows that is separate from the ogl interface.  this is important for cygwin/mingw systems where it is possible to use both wgl and ogl style interfaces simultaneously.  also rename LIBRT to RT to be consistent with the other BRL-CAD library AC_SUBST values
