john fixed the mged crash bug where running the B command on bad geometry would cause the crash.  he reports that This was caused by a bug in db_recurse() where it would try to free an rt_db_internal even when there was nothing to free. The fix was to check that there is actually something there before freeing. This eliminates the crashing, but the bad geometry will still not be drawn. (fixes sf bug 1220146, reported by Karel Kulhavy - clock3)
