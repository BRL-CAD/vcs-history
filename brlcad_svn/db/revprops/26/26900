BRL-CAD is comprised of several isolatable projects that have specific
distinguishing qualities of utility that make them useful as
stand-alone projects to a wide audience of users.  In some cases,
these projects may be independently maintained and are sometimes
independently distributed.  These projects are described in this file.
