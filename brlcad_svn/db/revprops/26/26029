fix AND improve the adrt checks.  some variables had changed (making them wrong) for testing sdl/python; they're now fixed.  add an --enable-adrt option that is coupled to the --with-sdl and --with-python options including all the additional checks for making sure all the various combinations make sense or output messages or abort.  before doing any BC_RETRY_CONFIGURE, output a message as to why we are retrying.  sdl test only needs to check for sdl-config if sdl is actuallly going to be used, same for python.  make the jove test consistent with the other tests.
