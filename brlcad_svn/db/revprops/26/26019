begin initial support for creating an in-memory geometry database (routines will likely move into librt, but here for now for simplicity (db_open_inmem() and db_create_inmem()).  also send the length of each object over the wire as an ascii string for simplicity so we can easily restore the bu_external structure without going through hoops.  add an rt_init_resource() call for convenience until the next release since db_open() is bugged on earlier versions.
