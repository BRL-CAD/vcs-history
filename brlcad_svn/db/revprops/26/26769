yet another fairly massive rewrite, this time mostly just restructuring.  keep track of the basename for better output messages and refactor the initialization steps into a function.  also refactor the libtool failure check into a function while we're at it as well.  all steps towards being able to cleanly handle manual build steps of projects using recursive configure. oh, and this change removes the directory change to the autogen.sh script, so it must once again be run from the top source dir at least for the time being.
