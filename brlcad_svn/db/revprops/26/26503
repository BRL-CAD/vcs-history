fixed asc2g bug reading files with carriage returns.  if you attempted to run asc2g on a .asc file that came directly from the windows platform and had embedded carriage returns ('\r'), it would incorrectly parse the v4 I units version string dumping out a wierd undecipherable overlapping error (printing the carriage return), now it handles them correctly.
