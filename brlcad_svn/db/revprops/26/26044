give the server something to do with the geometry sent to it -- the client can specify objects that should be shot at via MSG_ARGS packets.  the server stashes those object names and then shoots a ray at them when the client disconnects.  since external packets actually include their data lengths inside, we don't need to send that object length as a string.  server now correctly stashes the geometry as in-memory objects.
