add a lot of checks for valid pointers as part of isolating a 'P' binding crash bug (sf bug 1375751: P shuts down mged).  the crash was the result of a bus error inside of Tcl_AppendResult of all places, where the second Tcl_AppendResult() after the one inside not_state() would cause a crash.  this may indicate some other interp initialization problem, but the fix in place does seem to keep things going nicely.
