Add an initial PAD template file for BRL-CAD.  The version and date details are filled in by configure so that the file doesn't have to keep getting updated (needs more work) during release time.  This file is used by a lot of on-line distribution sites (predominantly by shareware distributors, but others including open source too), so that it is easier to add the package to those on-line distribution sites.  PAD is Portable Application Description, an XML data description used by application authors to dissemminate information to anyone interested in their software products.
