to quote Bob's commit to src/archer/archer "All of archer including the tclscripts is assigned to u.s. government and should be under the LGPL" so add the boilerplate legal header and remove the survice claim.  the COPYING file requires this as well.  also add the boilerplate variables footer while we're at it.
