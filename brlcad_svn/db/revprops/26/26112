Forgot to mention that considerable time was spent profiling and
optimizing the raytracer.  in particular, performance enhancements
were made in support of reducing large image overhead and some
unnecessary pixel processing.  this is particularly important for
background pixels, i.e. primary rays that miss the model.  performance
observed varies based on number of primary rays and the number that
miss, but results show anywhere from 5% (small "full" images) to 300%
increase (large "empty" images):

For example, shooting at a single sphere on a viewsize of 100000 at a
10kx10k pixel image, increase shows:

Before:  about 700,000 rtfms
 After:about 2,200,000 rtfms

Benchmark results increased consistently from about 2120 to 2270 on
one machine (mac g5), which seems reasonable given their relatively
tiny size and general lack of background.  shark made profiling fun.
