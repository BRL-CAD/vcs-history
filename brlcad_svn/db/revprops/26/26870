initial stub of a libfb IF_WGL 'wgl' interface to replace usage of 'ogl' on Windows.  this is done to support the libdm design intent of interfaces for each style of display manager, instead of piggy-backing on top of 'ogl' and complicating the code with preprocessor WIN32 checks everywhere.  haven't updated the names/code yet.. just a stub file.
