add tests to determine whether we successfully found a system bison/flex yacc/lex tool pair for making parsers.  if either isn't found, the parsers that are written to utilize them are disabled to prevent compile errors and a warning is output.  if they are availabe WITH_PARSERS is provided to the makefiles and BC_WITH_PARSERS is defined for code to conditionally test against.
