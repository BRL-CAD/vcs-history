separate out libs to one-per-line, progress once again towards making the librtms convenience library non-static-only to avoid libtool bugs on various platforms.  it is noted that the version of libtool that ships with mac os x 10.2 will not correctly function here, as it ends up adding librtms multiple times as a static library (regardless of -static) resulting in muliply defined symbol errors.
