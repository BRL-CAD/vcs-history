g2asc now saves additional _GLOBAL attribute values.  previously, only the units and title were exported so that if a user had manually added additional attributes they were not being saved, now they are saved as attr commands in the ascii format.  (a situation where this was important was where a 'disclaimer' and 'description' attribute were added in addition to the title.
