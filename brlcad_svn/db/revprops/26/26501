updated the g2asc manual page with format details.  the manpage still talked about it being necessary for platform independent conversions, language and details were updated to note that this is no longer the case (that the binary will work just fine).  also mentions that binary and ascii are open specs, though ascii is subject to deprecation change without notice whereas the binary is not. also that the ascii should not be relied upon by external developers but that it is currently a tcl command script.
