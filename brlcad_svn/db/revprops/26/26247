to quote Bob's commit to src/archer/archer "All of archer including the tclscripts is assigned to u.s. government and should be under the LGPL" so add the boilerplate legal header.  the COPYING file requires this regardless for all commits whether implicit or explicit.  also add the boilerplate variables footer while we're at it.
