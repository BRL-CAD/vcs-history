add an initial implementation of a WindowsGL 'wgl' libdm interface using the former dm-ogl_win32.c code as a basis.  remove the XGL sections and add boilerplate checks that makes sure this interface can be compiled alongside the 'ogl' interface.  expects DM_OGL to be defined in order to get functionality.
