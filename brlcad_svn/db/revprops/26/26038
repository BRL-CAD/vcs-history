add BC_COMPLIANT_FLOAT and BC_COMPLIANT_DOUBLE for determining whether the floating point implementation seems to be IEEE 754 compliant.  a handful of tests are performed, namely checking that the epsilon tolerance matches the defined power, making sure 0 == -0, and that -0 is actually implemented.
