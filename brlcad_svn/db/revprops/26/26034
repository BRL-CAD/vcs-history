use rt_gettrees_and_attrs instead of rt_gettrees_muves.  the latter is a special hook routine provided to muves (though why rt_gettrees_and_attrs wasn't sufficient is a mystery to me).  the abstraction does keep them ever so slightly decoupled, but brl-cad code shouldn't be calling it even if rtshot was initially perhaps an example for them.
