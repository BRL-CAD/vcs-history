woot, this little "script" is in excess of 1000 lines... in celebration, finally break tradition with other autogen.sh convention by adding a more useful --help option instead of passing it on to configure.  also add support to override any of the command (autoreconf, automake, etc) options via a set of _OPTIONS environment variables.
