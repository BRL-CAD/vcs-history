Since we have moved to calling bu_malloc instead of malloc, we have to be
careful not to acquire BU_SEM_SYSCALL prior to calling bu_malloc (since it
tries to acquire that semaphore, and the program would hang forever).

Of course, it would be better not to overload BU_SEM_SYSCALL in this
instance, but to allocate an application semaphore.  That is a more sweeping
change for later.
