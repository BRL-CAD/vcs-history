Yet another massive rewrite/modification.  This time expand the document to include details relevant to all contributors, not just developers, so that the file is applicable to anyone with commit access (with particular attention to documentation writers).  Also, finally include some details on where we stand with C++ and clarify a lot of statements throughout with respect to style, conventions, and requirements.
