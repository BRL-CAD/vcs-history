one more restructuring step, this time propagating the dbip so that the copy_ functions have the right signature to be used as a db_functree callback.  instead of proliferating the usage of the dbip global pointer even further, only the top-level hook functions use the global then all other routines are using the one passed as an argument (denoted with _dbip instead of dbip to avoid shadowing).
