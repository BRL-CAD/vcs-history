fixed g_diff attribute comparison issue.  when doing a g_diff, attributes were not being compared in order if the db command fails to tclify the exported version resulting in a binary 'these objects seem to differ' when they did not.  the tclification was improved so it can perform a proper ordered attribute comparison under more cases.
