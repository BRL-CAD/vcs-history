fixed multiply referenced object illumination bug (sf bug 1218812) where mged fails to properly track the muliply referenced objects causing a bad directory list, causing a crash.  the reported crash is fixed though multiply referenced objects (in a single combination) are still problematic.  also fixed a bug in the nmg code where it was crashing while freeing an nmg object.
