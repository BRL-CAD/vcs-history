reviewed the list of undocumented commands and annotated those being scheduled for removal in here so we know which can be removed without warning.  reviewing the list, researched dozens of additional commands and added many to the list for removal including the yuv image converters, texturescale, additional animation commands fbanim pixflip-fb chan_add, pixfields, pixfieldsep, and NOT all of the plot3 tools (only those that overlap with the overlay command). and probably a few more I'm missing on visual review.
