state more specifically what the improvements cliff made to the brlman application are in user terms: gui mode and works better on non-script platforms (i.e., windows).  was: Several improvements have been made to the brlman utility.  First, it is no longer necessary to use sh or bat wrapper files to launch it.  Second, the gui mode now starts up even without a man page specified on the command line (in Windows, you can now double click on brlman and have it start up) and provides the list of man pages on the left to allow browsing.
