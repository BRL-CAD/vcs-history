With clang 3.4.1 on *BSD, we need to make sure we have both the -pedantic and -std=gnu89 flags in addition to the Werror flag defined for the test (pedantic is what triggers the -Wc99-extensions flag).  We evidently weren't getting the pedantic flag in the compile test, but do get it in the main build.
