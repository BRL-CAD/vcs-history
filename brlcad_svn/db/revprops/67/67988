this logic is quite complex.  possibly not a proper fix, but we were looping infinitely over an edgeuse list when trying to close it when working with fuzing fewer than 3 edges.  this successfull avoids infinite looping by removing the edge from our remaining edge list once we tried to process it.  problem observed on patch-g with ch53 model.
