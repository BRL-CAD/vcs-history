The pix-ppm program's output is not understood by the gimp, and libicv's support seems iffy as well.  Rather than spend time trying to fix our own one-off on this, grab libnetpbm (NOT the full netpbm distribution, just the core lib that does the pbm/pgm/ppm/pam family of image formats) and use that.  At the moment it's just being used to replace the old ppm read/write support in libicv, but should be fairly straightforward to get all 4 formats working transparently.  Needs build testing on Windows.
