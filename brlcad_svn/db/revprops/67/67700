remove the 'experimental', i.e., undocumented and never really used but incurred considerable maintenance cost over the years, pov command.  the command was by carl nuzman (arl summer student) as a one-stop command for setting a view.  lots of ways to create a conflicting specification and there are many (albeit multi-command) alternatives available for setting the view.
