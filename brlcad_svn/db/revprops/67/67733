per user request, cliff added a -m option to the lc command (in r67718) that reports regions that share a region ID number but do not share the same material ID or los values. (rewording to clarify what disjoint means, comment was 'Add -m option to lc to report region_id sets containing non-matching material_id and/or los values.'
END
