cliff did the actual work and it helps to fit the descriptions more tersely onto one line.  this annotates the pix-bw fix that found differences when it was converted to icv where the storage format is double and lrint() is called to get an average.  this resulted in a better bw, but different output.  remotely related, no longer any reason to keep pix-bw3 since the exact same is achievable using pix-bw with an option.  there may still be a need for something like bw3-pix for merging images back into an interlaced image but killing it by association.  need to teach bw-pix to handle three images before release.
