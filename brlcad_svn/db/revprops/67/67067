rework the rt_shootrays() logic to preallocate all rays at once, initialize them in a separate pass, and then dispatch them all at once.  while more coherent, we're not going to see huge gains due to other stalling.  however, this sets the stage so that we can dispatch these rays in parallel more easily.
