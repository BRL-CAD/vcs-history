simplify.  no longer keep a copy of the mime header stashed into the repo as this is just complicating matters, especially halting the build.  with no stashed copy, there is nothing to sanity check, nothing to accidentally edit.  generated sources are stashed into the build tree and copied into place.  need to confirm the header gets properly installed.
