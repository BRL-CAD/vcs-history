Remove the mime/prefix bits from bu_path_component.  It's undecided what we'll do about supporting prefixes - we have a potentially ambiguous case on Windows if a user has a g: drive and wants to specify a .g file prefix to a path with g:/path/to/file - did we mean a file on g: or a file on the current drive with the .g type?  Whatever we do end up with, it should live separtely from bu_path_component - probably with the mime handling logic.
