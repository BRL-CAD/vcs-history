Use MathJAX for rendering equations (e.g., include/brep/pullback.h:get_closest_point).  this makes the doxygen output render embedded latex equations clientside instead of trying to run them through latex/dvips, which doxygen tries even when latex is turned off and is not installed.  gorgeous result, tested on safari+chrom+firefox on mac.
