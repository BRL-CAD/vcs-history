remove the various 'program continues running statements.  while some that are preceeded by a usage statement may be confusing when the program doesn't exit, it's similarly redundant to tell them that the program is running when that is evident (by the program still running).  maybe need to review these to see why they're printing usage instead of a more helpful message.
