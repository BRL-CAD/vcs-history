Got examples of all 5 image types working, but in the process discovered that the RtImg script will not work in parallel.  Looks like it's using universal temp file names or some such, with the net result that running mulitple rtwizard scripts results in them stomping all over each other, even if we assign separate working directories to each script execution.  That's not going to cut it - must fix.
