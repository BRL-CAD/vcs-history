Add -size and -fsize filters to the search command.  The -size option will filter based on individual object sizes.  -fsize, by comparison, filters based on the 'full' defintion of the object based on its hierarchy - i.e., for a comb, it will filter based on that combs size summed with the sizes of all the objects below the comb in the hierarchy.  These options are intended to help users quickly narrow down what the 'big' objects are in a .g file and what hierarchy definitions might be combining to produce large objects.
