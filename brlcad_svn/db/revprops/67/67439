The Tcl initialization code used by bwish/btclsh, mged, and potentially other C Tcl/Tk programs should be a common routine (or at least, the 'default' elements of it) - make a stab at defining such a routine in libtclcad.  For now it's just going to be used in testing with rtwizard, but if/when the kinks are ironed out it should replace similar code in bwish and (probably) mged.
