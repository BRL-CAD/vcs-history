And the weird rolls on... XGetWindowAttributes, despite its name, apparently updates some aspect of the window so that xwa's width/height (and indeed the window refresh\!) are accurate.  This puts a Tk call in the configureWin_guts... if worst comes to worst and there's not way to avoid this sort of thing, this should at least be a function callback rather than hardcoded Tk.
