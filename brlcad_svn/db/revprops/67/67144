Now we're getting somewhere.  Multiple-hundred word key set, mapping to numbers, dupliate keys with different numbers for checking 'final assignment wins' property, null string in key set to make sure null keys are errors, C++ std::map is used for correctness testing, iteration over hash table also tested.  Tests are now passing, add to ctest.
