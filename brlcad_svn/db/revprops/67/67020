simplify the compression code.  no need for the capability to riddle the code with compile-time blocks and create variable-length structs.  only conditionalize the actual compression code which will probably make sense to also deconditionalize eventually (i.e., always compress).  found+fixed a bug in master where it wasn't properly sizing the compression buffer to fit the component length, unset variable or moved code.
