with the cmake build placing build targets into the bin dir, finding them is greatly simplified.  so we don't need to be aware of the source tree.  as regression tests are (by definition) testing user tools, everything being tested should be in the bin dir.  probably not necessary to even keep bench in the list, but leaving it alone for now.
