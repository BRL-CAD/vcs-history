rename a second time for even less inconsistency.  the mime type mentions really feel out of place here (and are the remaining inconsistency as the example implies all are without a mime prefix), especially the enum extension hack...  as there is mime api, should probably just have a string pass that strips the mime before bu_path_component() gets its hands on it.
