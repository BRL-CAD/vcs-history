make rt_shootrays() fire rays in parallel automatically.  this is implemented using the new bu_parallel feature that runs as many threads of execution as can usefully be run, up to the number of available cores, but respecting other bu_parallel threads so the machine is never oversubscribed.  it means it'll run as fast as it can cooperatively.  currently individual ray dispatching is done one at a time per thread with simple semaphore bookkeeping though we'll eventually want to dispatch bundles coherently for even greater performance.
