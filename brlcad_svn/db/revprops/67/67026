first pass attempt at fixing a bug reported by bob anderson (and others using rtg3 near him).  it was assuming an initialized vls meant we had a file path, unaware that it was simple zero-initialized and empty.  needs more testing, but this should do the trick.  move the ray_data_file global and option specification here too, so it's localized where it's used.
