The nice trick of making custom build targets for archer, rtwizard and isst that share the name of the script file doesn't work for an in-src ninja build.  If we shift all of these to mged style C executables rather than being launched via bwish or btclsh we should be able to restore the 'archer' and 'rtwizard' targets, but for now add a prefix to avoid the circular dependency in ninja.
