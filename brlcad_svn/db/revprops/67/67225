Sigh.  Sean pointed out that some of our image processing tools may be assuming they'll get PIX out of the box, which is a fair point.  It's ultimately the apps responsibilty to specify png, but we should review our 'user facing' tools (as opposed to the processing tools that are designed to be piped together) to make sure they are in fact defaulting to png...
