remove the old unpublished rt_shoot_many_rays() multiple-ray dispatching interface.  while an interesting approach, relying on a per-ray callback to set each ray for dispatch, the approach is inherently contentious with the need to semaphore block the book-keeping called per ray.  plus, it doesn't let the caller precompute all rays in advance coherently.
