gang up -L with the previously undocumented -S option so we can consistently keep the capital letters implying negation (no subtractions) and represent a more generalized notion of drawing simplified wireframes.  reword the -L option so that it can more generally apply to any object, though finding a good generalized metric may not be easy.
