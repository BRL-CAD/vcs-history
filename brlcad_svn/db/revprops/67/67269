add a note about identical path names would conceivably fail the stat and GetFileInformationByHandle test methods, but we pretend they would result in the same lookup.  by that same measure, we could have completely different files actually map to the same thing on disk (i.e., a false positive) on a crazy-fast-changing filesystem.  not a case we particularly care about, but worth noting.  eliminate an unnecessary scope increase and redundant comment while we're at it.
