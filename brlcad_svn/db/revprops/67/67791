For now, take BUILD_TYPES specific assignments of CHECK_C_FLAG and CHECK_CXX_FLAG results out of the picture.  CMAKE_C_FLAGS apparently gets picked up by the check_c_source_runs tests, but the config specific vars do not.  Rather than relying on CMAKE_C_FLAGS, we should be using the documented CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS variable to define our testing environment - TODO. This also exposes a problem of how to store and use results specific to debug/release environment definitions in a single CMake configuration process, which is not well handled currently.  Possible solutions include build time selection of different config.h files and forcing CMake to operate in one-config-per-cmake-run mode regardless of whether the build tool supports multiple configurations, but what the 'correct' solution is isn't clear to me yet.
