fix ostensibly the remainder of quoting issues precluding running from paths with spaces.  look_for was indeed failing to find dirs because of spaces in  paths; changed to +shift method. also fixed buggy evals introduced on the previous; needed to escape all quotes and slashes being evaluated, not just the command name itself.
