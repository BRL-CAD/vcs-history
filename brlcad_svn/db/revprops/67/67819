add solid.h to the deprecation list - currently public API, should ultimately be managed by libdm backends.  Currently exposed in libtclcad, mged and libged - some refactoring and command rework will be needed to hide it successfully, but the idea will be for applications to specify *what* they want drawn (probably via ascii paths or db_full_path entries) and have the dm manage *how* it is drawn.  struct solid falls squarely into the 'how' category.
