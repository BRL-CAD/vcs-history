adding -msse3 does not seem to get past this line giving a build failure on mac: error: unknown machine mode      'V8QI'.  adding -D_BSD_SOURCE=1 and -msse3 did not work.  specific source of the problem remains unknown, but updating to the newer vector_size attribute instead of mode gets us a clean compile.
