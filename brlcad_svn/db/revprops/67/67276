Significant simplification/rework of the DocBook build logic.  This consolidates all formats output by a given xml file into a single build target, as well as the validation step for that file.  Should mean a lot fewer script files and build targets to accomplish a given DocBook build, although it needs testing on Windows and with PDF building enabled.
