revisit work back in r57743 and r57742 where we try to avoid ptbl crashes when referencing NULL, trying to give our bomb checks a chance to catch them more gracefully.  since pointers could be data on the stack, we need to trick the compiler a bit to not warn about the test always being true (it's the ones that are not that we care more about).  we do this by forcing a conversion to int first.
