mgedObj has view info - use that rather than stashing anything per-page.  Initialize the view with the initial draw, then don't change the view in any subsequent draws by using draw's -R option.  Now, whatever view the user is looking at, on any 'page' of rtwizard, will be the basis of the render - no local per-page view state, other than the list of objects being drawn.
