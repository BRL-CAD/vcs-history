Tweak all things man page so we're (in principle) ready for multiple man pages in different languages.  Go with the Debian setup, which puts the en man pages in the toplevel and makes <lang>/man# subdirectories for other languages.  Since we don't have any non-english man pages as yet this is is hypothetical, but it should set the stage.
