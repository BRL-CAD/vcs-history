Sean and I tracked down a change introduced by pix-bw using libicv's conversion routines.  The new approach is an improvement (lrint rounding rather than C truncation during int->double conversion) but it will result in different pixel values when rouding decisions change.  Since this potentially user visible (albeit subtle) add a note in the NEWS file.
