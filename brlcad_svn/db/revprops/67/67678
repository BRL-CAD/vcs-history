Massive rewickering of the archer deployment project.  After meeting and applying time estimates, the project was beyond the defined scope at 25+ weeks of effort.  Faced with either identifying dependencies and resources or defering/separating into multiple projects, the latter path was taken.  Now deployment spans two projects with the first being a completion of ALPHA tasks and the latter a completion of essential BETA tasks.
