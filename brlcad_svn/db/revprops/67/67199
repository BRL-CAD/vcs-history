Use tbz2 compression for verbose control images.  Add dpix icv tests - note that icv itself generated the original dpix image since we don't have a pix-dpix binary, but the dpix-pix binary was used to confirm that the resulting dpix image did indeed convert back to the original pix file without using libicv's routine to do so.
