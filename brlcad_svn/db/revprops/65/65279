Simplify bu_opt further.  The callbacks can handle the min/max arg validation, so there is no real need to specify it in the definition.  We're supplying a doc string for the args in any case - having the user handle the documentation piece of the optional nature of an arg is worthwhile since it saves us both implementation complexity in the description generator and (more importantly) shortens the option description.  The arg_process functions are simply supplied with the entire remaining argv array that hasn't been processed (with a little extra work to handle equals sign-bearing options), which also avoids the need to malloc, construct and free a duplicate argv.
