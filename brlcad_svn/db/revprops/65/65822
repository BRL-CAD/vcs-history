begin a list of contributors to the opencl accelerated pipeline effort.  lots of primitives to get through, spatial partitioning, bundling, boolean weaving, etc.  jon broke ground on the very first piece, converting sph shot evaluation to opencl (unoptimized, incoherent, unbundled) as exploratory research, validity testing, and overhead estimation.  expect many others will contribute to the effort before it's complete.
