the addition of tinycthread for gct begs design discussion, whether / how to expand libbu's threading API.  on the surface, the next step probably involves exposing thread-level controls.  this is fairly easily extracted from bu_parallel's guts for all existing threading models with some minor changes.  adding support for individually starting, stopping, and waiting for threads would provide a fairly simple cross-platform abstraction.
