swap the search ordering so that the posix name is tested/found first before looking for the underscored version.  freebsd has both _pipe and pipe (it's a weak alias, not different like on windows), so the #define is the wrong result.  probably a good idea to test all the _symbols in that order, but will have to be tested on windows
