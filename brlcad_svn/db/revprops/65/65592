Push Tcl out of librt, except for the Tcl_Interp pointer in the rt_wdb data structure.  Move the rt tcl specific functions and interface to libtclcad, push brlcad_interp up to libged.  Not 100% percent sure this is really minimally impacting - if it has to be reverted, at least this commit will document the changes.  libged is next, but it looks like it's using Tcl for portable inter-application communication for rt/rtcheck on Windows and view_obj appears to use it extensively - those could be tricky to handle.
