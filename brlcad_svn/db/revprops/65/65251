Quell the remainder of the STEP compilation warnings where there was an inconsistent type definition on the Load() function.  The base class specifies a SDAI_Application_instance (which is also the dominant use), but a handful of class entity types like SDAI_Select and a few other more specific types.  This change makes them all specify an app instance pointer with casts back to their expected type accordingly (which is what the compiler was doing anyways, hence the warnings).  Ideally, they should actually be using an app instance or the base class should be using a different common type.
