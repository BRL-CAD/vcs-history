Start preparing for the end of config_win.h - it's a leftover from the autotools/MSVC project days.  Now that we have CMake we should be testing for what it currently has hardcoded to make brlcad_config.h work for everyone.  Will be a fair bit of logic to move over, but worth it from a long term perspective.
