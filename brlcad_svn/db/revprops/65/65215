Since we're at C89 for the moment, provide a macro based assignment that will allow for non-static pointers to be assigned to option description set_var values conveniently without requiring the static array initialization.  Also start setting up the bu_opt unit tests to do actual value assignment verification, rather than crash/no-crash.
