break up the monster bot.c file a little bit so we can separate out all of the bits that pertain to decimation.  turn off the new incremental mesh simplification method from alexis' gct code until it's more portable (there are assembly bits that are failing to compile on bsd, windows, etc.  jon is getting a baseline on whether the asm is worth keeping. separating out the bot_edge struct too since it's shared by several routines, but not making public.
