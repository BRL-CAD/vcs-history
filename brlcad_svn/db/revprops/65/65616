move the callback parameter to the end of the function list for bu_observer_notify() in order for existing code to keep linking.  C allows functions to be called with fewer-than-specified arguments, albeit with undefined behavior, but generally passing 0.  it's a sleazy way to claim that this is minimally impacting.  allowing it for this exceptional case since this API a) is really obscure and unlikely used outside of our code and b) directly exposed Tcl which really sucked for base public api to have such a major dependency.
