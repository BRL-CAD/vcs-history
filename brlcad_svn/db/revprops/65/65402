this should be calling Tk_FreeColormap() not XFreeColormap.  also need MAC_OSX_TK to be set (which Tk's build sets when compiling Tk, but ours does not) before including the Tk's Xlib header.  would be better tied to an aqua define but don't want to add build system support until it's confirmed that any of this even works.
