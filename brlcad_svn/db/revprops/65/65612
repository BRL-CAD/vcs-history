add initial support for datums as a first-class database object.  Datums are a non-solid geometric entities intended for storing reference points, lines, planes, and combinations thereof (e.g., a coordinate reference frame consists of three orthogonally intersecting planes, three axes at their intersections, and a center point).  The semantics used here closely follow ASME standard Y14.5M and the various ISO standards regarding datums (e.g., ISO 5459 and ISO 1101), but without support thus far for other aspects like datum features (e.g., an actual manufactured point/edge/surface) and feature control frames (annotation with symbols, datum, and tolerance info).  This is also a nearly complete example for how to add a new entity to BRL-CAD, including basic I/O support, some callbacks (e.g., plot), and fundamental commands (in, make, keypoint, l, etc).  Main bits missing are a proper wdb/construction interface, GUI support, and ray tracing (which aren't really applicable to datums).
