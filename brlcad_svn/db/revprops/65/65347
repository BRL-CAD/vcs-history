aha, thanks to cliff for pinpointing what was causing my confusion regarding disappearing semicolons.  turns out ARGN list elements are semicolon delimited internally, so quotes were needed.  take a slightly different approach on the message() override by making it consciously handle the optional argv1 message type, while logging/passing it on accordingly.
