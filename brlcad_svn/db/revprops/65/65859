Make a stab at cleaning up a problem where we were using outputs from one add_custom_command in multiple build targets.  Per the CMake documentation this isn't safe for parallel builds.  Need to do a systematic check through the build logic to see if we're doing this anywhere else.  These changes need testing in heavily parallel environments to see if they are adequate - for example, it may be necessary to assign the include directories for the obj targets on a per target basis in stead of using the global include_directories command to make sure one of the targets doesn't end up trying to use a header from the other directory (we could have unique header names too - I'm not sure which is the best way to go with that yet.)
