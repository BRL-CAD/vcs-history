Complete the elimination of brlcad_interp.  Have MGED and libtclcad stash their interp in the ged structure to provide an interp to the rt and rtcheck commands.  Needs more testing, but with any luck this is the last step.  Basically the requirement for any non libtclcad gedp that wants to use interp commands is the application has to supply its interp pointer to gedp->ged_interp rather than leaning on the global (which is now what mged does).  Getting Tcl out of libged altogether is going to be much tougher, since asyncronous rendering and display features are relying on Tcl channels and methods (especially on windows)
