back by popular demand, you can now run the 'inside' command on edit state objects again.  bob restored this feature after the backwards-compatibility and efficiency concerns were raised by victor cericole at an arl configuration change meeting.  the feature raises a whole category of concerns on how to best handle edit state objects with libged (and as yet unresolved).
