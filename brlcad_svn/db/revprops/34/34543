reports of a crash on Mac OS X from 'irocha' on the brl-cad help forum with a reported crash trace leading to the DisplayWidth() call.  this would seem to imply that there is a display without a default screen and (more specific to the crash) that DefaultScreen() is a null pointer.  so we check it.  if it is indeed null, try to create or request the screen associated with the window we created.
