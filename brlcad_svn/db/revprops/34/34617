move the needFunc stubbed-empty example from src/test into here so that we don't have a library calling a fracking undefined symbol.  bad design.  probably needs to be an overridable virtual or a app-registered callback.  either way, this resolves all symbols for this lib and allows -no-undefined to work.  sort the file list while at it.
