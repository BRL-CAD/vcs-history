this is actually in contention for worst hack to date.  fix the underlying bug where a pointer is getting serialized to a string (seriously?!), but it was getting truncated to 32-bits (causing a crash on 64-bit platforms).  change the casting and go through void to quell warnings.  this routine should not exist.
