push the reading and writing down from rt_mirror into ged_mirror.  rt's API shouldn't generally be performing name lookups for specific actions, instead working on objects already in memory (rt_db_internals) so that you don't need a .g to perform an action.  modified the signature of rt_mirror to return the modified rt_db_internal instead of a directory pointer.
