linear approximation a lot closer, now need to get the final newton
step working on the trims. I do see some artifacts from the tangent sign 
change in the UV horizontal(v) but as discussed that should be an easy fix,
The hit checks (odd/even) are back on so you may see some background specks 
around edges - this seems to have cleaned up some of the odd looking behavior
in the images BRLCAD generated (but didn't check all models)
