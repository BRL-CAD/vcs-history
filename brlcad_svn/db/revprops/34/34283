refactor fb_close_existing() out of fb_cmd_close_existing() so that it will close a given fbp without needing to serialize/deserialize a pointer to a string.  this is (still) horribly divergent from libfb's callback interface but none of the fb-specific *_close_existing() calls are stored in their interface FBIO object.
