topic came up again today, expand on the need for a 3d plot object primitive.  ideally/probably needs to support points, lines, polylines, arcs, circles, spline curves, and text.  the _plot() callbacks should then return a plot object instead of the current vlist/polyline data that it returns.  all sorts of implications and benefits including automatic wireframe LoD and optimized representation.
