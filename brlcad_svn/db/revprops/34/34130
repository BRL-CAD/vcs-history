note that richard and keith added support to rtarea to computer center of presented/exposed area.  this is related to sf patch 1942589 (Exposed & Presented Region Area Center points) from andrecastelo but it was determined that the patch was incomplete/unusable.  this feature has been requested by analyst users (specifically from r. dibelka as well).
