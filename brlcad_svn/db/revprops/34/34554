Turn off box growing in the NURBS for now - plotting the bounding boxes reveals that the scaling factors are causing the sizes to go waaaay out of line.  The visual artifacts being seen appear to be the result of bounding box intersection errors - parent bounding boxes are found, but the children do not intersect properly.  Appears to be related to opennurbs_ext.h:243 in some way.  Growing the bounding boxes just 'hides' the problem.
