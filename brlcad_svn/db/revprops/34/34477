had it in mind for years now to record a matrix above all primitives (akin to putting each primitive into their own comb) so that all primitives will retain a local coordinate system by default (where their V stays at 0,0,0).  this will help primitives like the torus support non-uniform scaling without screwing with the implicit form of a torus.
