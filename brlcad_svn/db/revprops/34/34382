Need src/conv/step in the list for Makefile generation.  Attempts to build as of r34379 seems to suggest that there are missing files that need to be checked in to get a working src/conv/step build - ssince src/conv/step is currently keying off the BUILD_STEP variable (which bty it shouldn't do that forever - in theory it should check for a system install if BUILD_STEP is off) turn off STEP altogether until it the rest of the necessary files get checked in.  This is a TEMPORARY measure only - fix asap!
