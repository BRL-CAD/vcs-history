this one is borderline user-visible but does impact the style/appearance of mged and archer so go ahead and mention it.  bob worked on converting several/many of the widgets in archer and a couple in mged over to using the new tk 'ttk' widgets.  ttk is a new modular themable widget system developed for tcl/tk 8.5.  these new widgets even further make BLT unnecessary.
