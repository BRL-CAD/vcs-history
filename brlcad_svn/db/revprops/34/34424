break out a tor_mirror() routine using the logic nearly identical to what is happening now in rt_mirror() with the exception of using a plane_t instead of pt+dir (so we still reconstruct pt+dir for now).  first step towards a new primitive rt_###_mirror() callback on all primitives that takes an rt_db_internal and a plane to mirror across.
