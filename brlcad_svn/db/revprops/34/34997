fixed Invalid NMG empty output bug in g-stl that was reported by mdavis (irc) that was causing the tool to exit early.  the problem seems to be two-fold, that the nmg_vface() routine had a minor logic error thinking it needs to abort and the nmg coming out of the dsp's tess routine is possibly an incomplete structure.
