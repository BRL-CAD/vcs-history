this should at least restore the build to a working state for now.  make it an EXTRA_PROGRAMS so we can traverse into here even though the fedex stuff isn't being generated.  (STEP_FEDEX_PLUS, STEP, and STEP_AP203 are not subst'd)  few other minor changes are keeping 'sources' and headers declared separately for consistency.
