Take a stab at some undo icons for Archer.  Also reorder the buttons a bit - it's a concern that an imprecise click intending to checkpoint a lot of work could have exactly the opposite effect, for example - or an attempt to create an arb accidently reverts the file.  Probably need to 'break up' the harmless, creative, and destructive operations to different parts of the toolbar or something else intelligent - in the meantime, at least put 'harmless' clicks on either side of the undo/checkpoint related buttons.
