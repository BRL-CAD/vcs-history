revert a change introduced in revision 8121, Mon Dec 27 22:46:05 1993, where the min_pt/max_pt comparison was (inadvertently?) changed from > to >= which is causing facetization problems when the structure is empty.  this in turn causes tools that use nmg_triangulate_model() to incorrectly fail (e.g., g-stl).
END
