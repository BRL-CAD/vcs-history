Switch brlman from a wrapper invoking awf to a wrapper invoking the system man command.  awf is not able to correctly handle output generated by the new docbook man page generation process.  The brlman shortcut is preserved for those not wishing to manually specify the path to the BRL-CAD man pages.  awf originally was intended to supply man page reading functionality on systems without their own man command, but nowadays the only major environment without a man command supported by BRL-CAD is Windows, and the awf solution doesn't work and has never worked there.  For platforms without any man command the new solution is to view the HTML versions of the man pages.  For other platforms with a man command, man pages such as search should now display correctly when brought up with brlman.
