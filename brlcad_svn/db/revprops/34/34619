we can cheat and fake the dependency resolve by letting libstepdai depend on libstepcore and allowing libstepcore to not require all symbols be defined.  this cyclic dependency really should be broken, though, as it will likely still cause portability problems.  the SDAI functions shouldn't be called from libstepcore.
