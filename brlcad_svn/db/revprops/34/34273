restored the mirror command's ability to take a trailing x|y|z axis option while still utilizing the new command wrappers.  instead of calling the edit wrapper, though, we just call the view wrapper and do the edit/redraw ourselves.  works like a charm.  this was specifically requested by victor cericole for efficiency/familiarity, albeit left it intentionally undocumented
