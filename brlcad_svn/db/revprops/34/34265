modify mirror's argument handling to make -p be for point and -o be for offset instead of (confusingly) implying 'scalar point value' and 'origin' respectively.  update the various docs and test cases as found while we're at it including fixing some really out-of-date old docs.  FIXME: really stupid that command help is in more than one place in the tcl sources.
