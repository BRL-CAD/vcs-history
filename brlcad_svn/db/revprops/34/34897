apply a fugly workaround for the Mac OS X 10.5 linker problem whereby it fails saying 'ld: cycle in dylib re-exports with /usr/X11/lib/libGL.dylib'.  the problem appears to be the glx internals making calls into the GL framework, which ends up finding the wrong (same) dylib during load.  the 'fix' is to tell it exactly where the framework dylib lives, which is done via a project-wide LDFLAGS so we don't have to pollute all the places it would be needed.
