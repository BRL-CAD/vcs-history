restore an _ifree() implementation that still 'cheats' by just leveraging the fact that all of the point structure types have a bu_list element that we can iterate over.  we can save a little time by avoiding to dequeue the points too since the list is being wiped out anyways.  stub in the _print() callback pretending that rt_pnts_internal is what we're going to use for the solid specific structure.
