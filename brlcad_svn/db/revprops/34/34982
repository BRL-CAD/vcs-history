fixed a problem in the ogl and X11 display manager where a fixed size buffer was causing mged to crash.  mike and tim pinpointed the problem, I applied a fix the dynamically allocates a buffer large enough for the available visuals.  was previous limited to 256, yet more than 800+ were being returned on Mac OS X 10.5 causing a memory overrun.
