renamed the file with the BRL-CAD version defines and copied it into the rc^3/include/brlcad directory
this way an application is able to memorize the BRL-CAD version it was compiled with at compile time
i.e. it can compare the BRL-CAd version of the DLL it is using with the one it was compiled with
END
