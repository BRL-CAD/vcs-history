integrate a library tester into the regression suite.  would be good to have a simple dynamic loading tool that will take a built library and compare the symbols its header says should be there.  moreover, we could make sure those functions will also run (with zero/null arguments) without crashing.  quick test shows that this should be entirely feasible and should uncover a lot of inconsistency cleanup.
