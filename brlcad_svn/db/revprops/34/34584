indicate that all of the step libs shouldn't be version-managed by libtool so that it doesn't create bogus/meaningless version suffixes.  add -avoid-version -no-undefined to hint libtool accordingly.  this is in response to sf (build system) bug 2796656 from pedro (incorrect numbering of shared libraries).
