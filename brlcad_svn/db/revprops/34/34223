Fixed memory issues CAD team was having with 'asc2g' on new Tcl based ASCII
format. There were a couple of issues, first memory wasn't being freed 
correctly from Tcl list object so took Bob's advice and changed usage 
in rt_bot_adjust(), second 'asc2g' was using Tcl_EvalFile() which buffers 
entire file into memory again causing issues with some large Pro-E 
conversions. Changed 'asc2g.c' to load ASCII file in manageable
size chunks and send through Tcl_Eval() instead.
