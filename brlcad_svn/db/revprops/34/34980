fix a bug identified by m.tegtmeyer and t.myers where a fixed-size buffer was getting overrun causing a crash.  determined that both the X and ogl display managers had the same bug, now fixed to make the buffer dynamic based on the number of visuals detected as available (from XGetVisualInfo).  got rid of some dead code and stereo conditionals while we're in here so we can simplify the logic.  this fixes the crash and should scale to insane visual counts (worth noting that mac os x 10.5 seems to be the only platform that provoked this bug with large number of visuals (800+).
