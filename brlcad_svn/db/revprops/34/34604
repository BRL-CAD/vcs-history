the X24_blit() logic is still wacky for zoomed windows but this change does stop the invalid memory access crashes that were occuring for small renderings (that had large zooms) during memcpy.  the line-duplication logic was copying from the middle of a line for the length of a line, which is only valid from the beginning of a line.  so we now duplicate from the beginning of the line (opix/holdit).
