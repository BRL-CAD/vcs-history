Because the library "librt" does not yet use the application struct member
"a_pixelext", a separate category was created in the comment section of the
application structure definition.  This distinguishes its status as something
the library does not currently use, but warns the programmer that this storage
has a defined meaning, and is not available for arbitrary purposes.
