If this works out, most of the messy pieces of 3rd party libs will be pushed down into the superbuild.  In an ideal world, as far as the main BRL-CAD logic is concerned, there shouldn't really be any difference between the local superbuild supplied version of the lib and a system version.  What to detect with find_package will be handled by the *_ROOT settings passed in at configure time from the superbuild.  It will be the superbuild's problem to produce the final installers and packages (which *will* be a problem) but it should no longer be necessary to handle it at this level.  In face, we may ultimately be able to transition these find_package calls to the portions of the code that are actually using them.
