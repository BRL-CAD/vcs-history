With the shift to plugins for ged commands, any test executables using them will need to be located in the bin dir, just like those tests that need files from the data dir, and for the same reason - we need bu_dir path lookups to work reliably, and for that we need to be able to decode the executable path to a correct relative location.  Sean noticed the bigdb_1gb test was failing when run with ctest but succeeded when run from the build dir.  Observing in debugger, bu_dir was succeeding when program was run in isolation from a working dir of the top level build dir, but failing when ctest did the launching.
