Revert the stepcode simplification and related converter logic changes.  Didn't change the functional issue seen with Windows+Ninja, and Sean is correct that this rework moves us significantly further from upstream.  I hate to do it in some ways - unless this refactor did in fact clash with the ISO standard, I think it did clean things up - but the better long term answer is to try and achieve something similar in the upstream code.  NOTE:  when I tried the upsteam stepcode, it did not work.  Not sure yet why.
