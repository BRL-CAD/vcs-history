Grumble... initial testing suggests that Tcl's configure script doesn't like the wacky installation path it needs to pass to --prefix.  Pretty much means we have to disable the odd pathnames test if we're using Tcl's native build, since those paths are central to its function.  (Could run it with Tcl disabled, which I suppose would be better than nothing...  if we can get a good isolated test case set up and confirm it's a Tcl issue, might be worth an upstream bug report.)
