Far enough along now to be interesting.  Implement a tabular stat command for reporting database object info, using https://github.com/seleznevae/libfort for table printing.  Can specify columns and sorting, as well as applying search filters to focus output.  Not sure this is a keeper, but checkpoint so progress is recorded.
