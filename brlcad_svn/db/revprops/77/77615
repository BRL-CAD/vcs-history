Generator expressions in install(CODE) is supported starting in CMake 3.14, but some of the stable Linux distros aren't shipping a version that new yet.  For the one case we're using it, force the executable we need to run to build in a predictable location and then just execute it directly from there.  Deliberately leaving the generator expression form of this commented out, because we should swap it back in as soon as we can require 3.14.
