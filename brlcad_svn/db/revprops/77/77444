fixed mged crashing when no DMs other than nu are available.

if all DMs except nu end up disabled after cmake, e.g., headless
server compiles or no-X11 builds, mged was crashing in classic mode on
attach prompt construction.  I made it less likely for libdm to return
no dms and made mged handle that condition regardless for
future-proofing.  bug that was observed by a user and myself.
