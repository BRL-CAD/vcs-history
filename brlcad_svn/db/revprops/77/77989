Remove a variety of menu entries from MGED

Removed from MGED's menu bar (unused features, can be accomplished
another way, or should be exposed only as lower level settings when
there are sensible defaults that seldom change):

ViewRing menu and entries.
Modes->Persistent Sweep Rectangle
Modes->Collaborate
Modes->Rateknobs
Settings->Mouse Behavior->Sweep Raytrace-Rectangle
Settings->Mouse Behavior->Sweep Paint-Rectangle
Settings->Mouse Behavior->Sweep Zoom-Rectangle
Settings->Apply To->Local Panes
Settings->Apply To->Listed Panes
Settings->Framebuffer->Rectangle Area

There are others on the TODO list, but they pertain a little more
directly to features known to be in use (lighting, display lists,
key forwarding) so those need a little more care to be sure the
alternative ways of managing them work and are documented - bump
them down to the next release iteration.
