It may be a while before it gets used, but stash the core piece needed for a time delta calculator using date.h, which is close to what's being considered for C++20.  Eventually, we can use this and replace the explicit math in the dreport_src logic in misc/CMake/BRLCAD_Util.cmake - stashing now so I remember how to do this next time.
