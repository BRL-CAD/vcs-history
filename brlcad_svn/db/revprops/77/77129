The 'nburst' refactor of the burst code is available.  Mostly a general cleanup of the code, which was previously in an early coding style quite different from most of BRL-CAD.  Although primarily intended for batch processing, it also provides a new command line interactive mode that replaces the early terminal menu system removed in 7.30.2.
