Closing multiple rt instances is crashing MGED on Windows.  Really need to defer I/O channel closure until all currently running subprocesses are terminated... in the meantime try not to do things that cause the crash.  This isn't a final solution, because I/O from any remaining running subprocesses will be lost as the first one calls the delete handlers and closes the channels.
