The guard we put in so long ago to prevent detecting an already installed BRL-CAD works against us in the superbuild, since we actually do want to be searching CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX now (it is the equivalent of the CMAKE_BINARY_DIR as far as being the intermediate staging area for the subbuilds - assembling the final bundle for actual installation will have to be a separate step.)  Accordingly, we no longer want to filter on CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX here - it actually breaks what we're trying to do.  We do, however, still want to prevent any searching in the final (i.e. /usr/brlcad/...) locations.  Variable names may shift over time, but for now get CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX out of the filtering and stub in a notional BRLCAD_INSTALL_PREFIX so we can proceed.
