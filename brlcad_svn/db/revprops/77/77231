Merge brep-debug logic into trunk

These changes are getting increasingly difficult to maintain in a
branch.  They are not changing much at the moment, so there is little
incentive to keep them separate in a branch. Moreover, the maintenance
cost of doing so is becoming significant.  The branch can be made again
when development resumes, but for the moment (since we don't want to
lose this work) bring the files back into trunk so they are part of
routine updates and modernization.
