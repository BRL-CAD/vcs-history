switch the nirt binding from 'n' to 'S' for shoot or sample.  need to review all bindings, but this adds some safety to the invocation.  switching the key binding to requiring a modifier (i.e., shift-s) makes it less likely to be accidentally triggered which is important given neither mged or archer handle nirt's invocation gracefully / asynchronously.  encountered a hard multi-minute unresponsive lockup while spinning a nurbs model around as nirt ran prep.
