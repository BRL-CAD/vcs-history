Commit some (commented out) examples of manipulation of the configure and build lines for more targeted testing of subbuilds in CI.  The msbuild diagnostics unfortunately didn't provide the cl.exe command line - best way to get that still seems to be inspection of the properties in Visual Studio - but may be useful down the road.
