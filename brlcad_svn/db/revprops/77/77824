implement the guts to bu_tbl using libfort.

this implements a basic table formatting API useful for all the
places where we currently display gridded table output.  first
proofed by cliff in the stat command, libfort is pretty awesome
for this purpose and will replace the other manual approach
started in num.c (for matrix printing).  intentionally not
exposing the breadth of libfort functionality.  this is 1) so
libbu API symbols can be kept to a bare minimum, 2) so calling
code can utilize similar/familiar code patterns (readability), 
and 3) so calling sites stick to a limited set of table styles
for end-user consistency and usability.
