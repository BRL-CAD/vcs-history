Ignore specific directories, not just the root dir of the install.  Per CMake docs, that actually won't work - the ignore vars ignore exact dirs, not subdirs in a prefix dir.  (A bit unfortunate, in some ways, since ignoring the subtree is really our intent here, but as far as I know CMake doesn't offer such a mechanism.
