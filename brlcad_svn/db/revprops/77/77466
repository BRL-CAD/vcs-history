Try to work around an issue with the Ninja Multi-Config generator - the combination of wrapping configure_file and setting source file properties is causing an issue with the 3.19 release candidate.  Don't know if other verisons have this issue, but for testing see if we can just dodge it - once upstream resolves this can go away.  Reported upstream as Issue 21325.
