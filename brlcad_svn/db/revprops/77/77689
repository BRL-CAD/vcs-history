Something isn't quite right with the build logic for header geneneration here - Windows isn't succeeding in its first pass, but does on its second.  That probably means there is some sort of dependency issue, but the error message is less than informative.  This isn't the first time this step has caused problems over the years... rather than trying to depend on a working Tcl/Tk stack for a simple quoting job, just use some basic (and self-contained) C++ to do the work.
