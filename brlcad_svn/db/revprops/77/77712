modify the test to make sure we can allocate enough.

upon observing and debugging test failures on lower-memory systems,
came to understand more specifically the cause being incredibly
inefficient handling by librt.  debugging shows a given allocation
passed in as title ends up creating 9 copies.  Due to how AVS are
copied/merged/recopied as they're synced as well as how objects are
serialized for export, there are as many as 5 copies simultaneously!

In order to combat this, we test whether we can allocate in advance
with malloc first, and halt if we can't get 5x the requested amount.
