per the usage, the caller can say 'No' and still provide the remaining 4 region args, it just won't do anything with them.  don't make it a fatal condition if that happens, just continue, since the caller (as is the case in mged) may just be a script that passes defaults.  avoids the caller needing to conditionalize.  undoing the error avoids a failure editing non-region combs via the combination editor in mged.
