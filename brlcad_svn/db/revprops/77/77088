This came up again... forward port and enable the most basic of the search command size filters from r67646.  This is just the dp->d_len object size filter, but it pairs with the ls options that can report size - with this in place, we can use ls -lS to get an overall report of object sizes and then search with -size and other filters to identify large or small subsets based on type.  Particular use case was trying to find a large plate mode bot in the FAA Generic_Twin.g example:  ls -lS to get an idea of size distributions and then search -type plate -size >50000 to find larger examples.  Would be nice to be able to specify sorting the search output on size at some point as well...
