Add a 'brlcad' custom target with ALL set, that depends on the deps target and triggers the BRL-CAD subbuild.  This has the effect of making BRL-CAD building a 'top-level' action for the superbuild project.  I.e., editing a source file in (say) libbu and then typing 'make' will rebuild the relevant portions of BRL-CAD, whereas with just the BRLCAD_BLD external project it would view the external project as 'complete' and not rebuild it.  The build will still not trigger on changes to the src/other files, which is a departure from the integrated src/other build but is apparently typical of ExternalProject_Add setups.  In particular, with non-CMake build systems possibly in use in external projects, the behavior we would see may be less than ideal in a rebuild scenario - it may be preferable to require a manual build+install step on the relatively rare occasions we need to change src/other files.
