No wonder the ninja multiconfig builds seemed fast in Release - we're not propagating the build flags for multiconfig setups, and for the first time that's now a real issue.  May explain why the step-g fails in multiconfig release and works in single config release with Ninja, but regardless we'll have to sort this out before we can compare apples to apples even if that's not the problem...
