Update stepcode to latest upstream develop branch as of Wed 09 Dec 2020 12:23:32 AM UTC.  A number of changes have been pushed to stepcode to ensure step-g et. al. can compile against that version.  Note that the resulting step-g has not yet been tested on models more complex than the built-in NIST examples, and so far only Ubuntu Linux has been tested at all.
