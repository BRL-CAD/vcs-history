Update to latest stepcode.  Surprisingly, the tests made after clearing the various stepcode warnings but before starting any rework to avoid C4251 issues appear to result in a successful Windows build.  A closer reading of https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-c4251 makes the language a bit more ambigous.  That page documents when C4251 may be ignored, but I had the impression ALL of the listed condtiions had to apply.  It may be that the error can be ignored if ANY of those conditions are true... that might explain why the build worked.
