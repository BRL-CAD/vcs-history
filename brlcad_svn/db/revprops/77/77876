Get a bit more sophisticated about the Tcl package lookup.  Just having Itcl isn't enough by itself - it would be for MGED/Archer, but we may also need to build Itk against the system Itcl install.  For that we need find_package(ITCL) to succeed.  (On Ubuntu, it's the difference between having itcl3 installed and also having itcl3-dev installed.)
