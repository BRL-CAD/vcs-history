Upstream has moved quite a bit from this version of SPSR, we've added the library call to it which still isn't in upstream, and experiments with the latest PoissonRecon project code indicated it now takes a huge amount of RAM to compile out of the box.  Strip this down somewhat and move it into a subdir of libbg, since a system version is currently guaranteed not to be suitable...  No particular point in paying the third party build maintenance overhead right now.
