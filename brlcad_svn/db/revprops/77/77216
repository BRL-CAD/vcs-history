This is a workaround, but if the build fails once try it a few more times before giving up.  Since a fair number of the failures seen so far are intermittent, multiple attemps may succeed instead of generating false negatives.  Switch execute_process to one call per action - per CMake docs that's the way to do sequential execution.
