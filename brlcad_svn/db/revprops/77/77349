Overhaul pixcmp with modified options and new output formatting.

Notably, changed -s to -q from silence to quiet, so we can add a -s
flag for printing same value matches.  Also changed -l to -d for
printing different bytes to be consistent.  Also added help flags.

Another notable change is now those -d and -s output lines will report
a label indicating whether the pixel or byte is matching, off-by-1,
off-by-many, or missing as pixcmp now also handles comparing different
size images.

Cleaned up printing and usage accordingly.  Will update other docs and
references subsequently.
