Backport a couple changes from upstream stepcode.

In order to prepare our step converter code for updating to the latest
upstream stepcode, we've backported a couple changes needed to make
the current version work the way the new one will.

Discovered I was testing with the wrong stepcode branch when I tried
upgrading earlier in the extbuild branch - stepcode's master wasn't in
a working state.  The develop branch was where updates and fixes had
been applied.  Fixed upstream with a ff merge of develop onto master,
and then tried again to test building step-g.

A couple class data members we were directly reading that have now been
protected in upstream classes.  Since the old code didn't have
equivalent accessors, we add them in our fork so our converter code
is ready to shift.

We will also need to address or ignore a couple compiler warnings being
tripped by the newer stepcode generated output.  Prefer to fix the
generated code upstream, but not sure yet how hard it will be.

Only other change spotted is an adjustment of the template that lists
the generated STEP C++ files to add the *_unity.cc files.  They include
all the individual entity files that are now being written.  There is
a note that not all compilers support those files, but we will have to
see - if we need to list individual entity files build logic will be
uglier, since we will need pre-generated per-schema lists of cc and h
files for CMake and we won't have any way to auto-generate them at
CMake time out of the box.
