Wrapping functions as we do here is discouraged (https://crascit.com/2018/09/14/do-not-redefine-cmake-commands/) but we've not been able to replace some of the functionality using other means.  Since we'll need to require 3.14 for this new setup to work, and ExternalProject_Add approaches remove some of the incentive to override 'standard' functions for bookkeeping purposes, it may not be practical to eliminate such usages.
