Update Find modules to respect _ROOT variables, add dependencies on _stage targets where appropriate.  This paves the way for allowing find_package to target the specific BRL-CAD directory that holds the installed outputs of the third party external builds.  The ability of find_package to respond first to a _ROOT variable is one of the drivers for requiring newer CMake.
