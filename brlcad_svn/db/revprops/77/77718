Ugh.  Looks like file(COPY) has some odd limitations when it comes to filenames with spaces in paths - it works some of the time, but not all the time (https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21420).  Hate to do it, but may have to fall back on native tools for this until file(COPY) gets sorted.
