initial addition and implementation of bu_temp_file() -- a relatively secure means to create a temporary file for use by applications.  this implementation should work on most platforms including Windows that support either mkstemp (POSIX) or tmpfile_s (ISO/IEC TR 24731-1) and should conform to the CERT secure coding of temporary file recommendations.  bu_temp_file() presently doesn't take any arguments, though that may change if needed by apps.  it does, however, auto-delete the temporary files on close through an atexit handler and a linked list of temp files that have been opened.  presently creates temp files in the first identifiable/usable temp dir searching TMPDIR, TEMP, TMP, /tmp, and the current directory, creating a file named BRL-CAD_temp_XXXXXXX if using mkstemp.
