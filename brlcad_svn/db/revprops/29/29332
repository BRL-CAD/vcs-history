semaphore protect the crash report being generated on bomb so that only one thread/process is writing out to the log file at a time.  only allow one of them to write to the file, depending on whether the log file for that process already exists.  we use BU_SEM_MAPPEDFILE since that really shouldn't be in use during bombing.
