fixed empty name crash when using mged 'lt' command.  this should fix a bug encountered in some crash logs that Craig Barker had and some mged crashes that he reported with 7.10.4.  the problem was an empty name being passed to lt which ended up getting passed to bu_log as a null ... argument, which subequently caused the fwrite to fail and bu_bomb to kick off.

END
