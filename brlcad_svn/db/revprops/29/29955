set a c-file-style globally in the local variables footer, setting it to the built-in 'stroustrup' style.  that style is basically the 'k&r' style with 4-char indents (otherwise emacs' 'k&r' style has 5-char indents), which matches our convention.  you can't specify c-basic-offset when you used c-file-style apparently (at least as of emacs 21.2.1) but conveniently the 'stroustrup' style matches so we don't have to care.
