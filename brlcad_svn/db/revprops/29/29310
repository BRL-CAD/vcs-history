add a similar new two-pass initialization approach that bwish/btclsh are now using such that tclcad_auto_path is only called if one of the init routines actually fails.  this helps ensure that we can use a system tcl (though doesn't take care of itcl loading/version problems).  make the error printing a little more consistent as well.
