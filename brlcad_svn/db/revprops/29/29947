(reworded line) Bob fixed the extended rendering delays that users would see when ray-tracing on Windows.  you could see via the log that the ray-trace would finish very quickly (nearly instantly sometimes) but then would stall for a minute or two before displaying the image to the framebuffer.  the problem was actually a manual Sleep() call that was added a long time ago (heh) to the wgl framebuffer that made it interactively update the image while it rendered and made a completed image not starve out other processes with massive CPU use.  now there's still problems interactively updating and it may starve others, but the delay is gone (and it was worse).
