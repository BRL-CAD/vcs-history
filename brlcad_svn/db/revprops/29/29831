provide DEG2RAD and RAD2DEG constants for pi/180 and 180/pi; rename the new V3AE2DIR to V3DIR_FROM_AZEL to be more consistent with other vmath macros, similarly making first arg the dir instead of last; implement the complementary AZEL_FROM_V3DIR for setting an az/el from a direction vector as well (untested)
