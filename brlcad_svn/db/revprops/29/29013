fix the .mgedrc saving. this was actually an 8.5 issue -- [font names] is no longer empty.  Tk now provides five fonts by default (TkCaptionFont TkTooltipFont TkHeadingFont TkTextFont TkDefaultFont) which was causing mged to not initialize its own fonts (and later causing the tclscript error about the font variable not being set).  actually check for one of our fonts via mged_default(text_font)

END
