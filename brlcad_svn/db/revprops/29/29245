Mr. Anderson fixed various non-normalized vector bugs with the ARBN primitive that was causing all sorts of problems with rotations, shading, mirroring, and more.  the primitive was assuming the vectors were normalized, thus causing the problems.  Johns fixes take care of sf bugs 1800148 and 1800161 reported by clock3/karel that specifically reported the mirroring and shading problems.
