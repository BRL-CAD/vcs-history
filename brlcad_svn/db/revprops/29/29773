update the pro/e plugin so that it also now implements the first half of sf request [ 1159469 ] "Pro/E converter improvements" whereby it now more appropriately parses the part number to part name mapping file and allows part names that have spaces in the name.  instead of stopping at the first whitespace, it now reads until the end of the line and extracts the part name, allowing for an arbitrary amount of surrounding whitespace that it trims off.

END
