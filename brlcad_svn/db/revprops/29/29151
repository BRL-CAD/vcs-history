first 10% of the review of the bu_bomb() instances.  updating many to bu_exit() for the instances where the error or exit condition aren't catastrophic errors (i.e. they wouldn't benefit from having a stack trace of how we got into that state code-wise).  this also makes it easier to refactor usages of log & exit too to the new routine.
