fixed variety of g-iges and other exporter crashes and graceful handling of mesh normal failures.  started with a particular model that was failing in the bot's tess() routine during the expensive nmg_fix_normals() processing.  turned out that the model was going amuck while trying to determine shell orientation eventually overflowing a char in an inf loop until it crashed.  the specific cause of the inf loop wasn't determined, but it does now detect the shell failure and aborts early instead of proceeding and running into a variety of bombing situations.
