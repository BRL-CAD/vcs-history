John fixed a bug in g_diff where differences between objects were getting missed due to the command not keeping track of the count of differences that had accummulated up to that point.  there was also an incorrect strcmp call that had the wrong truth value getting tested.  this fixes a bug reported by David Loman ([ 1865987 ] g_diff fails to see BoT Orientation change)
