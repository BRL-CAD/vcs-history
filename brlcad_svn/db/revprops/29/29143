add a new bu_exit() function that never returns.  this function differs from bu_bomb() in that it supports an error code and printf style arguments.  it should not be used for 'exceptional' exit conditions where stability and validity are in question; it should be used when you simply want to politely exit the application after printing a message (like printing application usage and exiting).
