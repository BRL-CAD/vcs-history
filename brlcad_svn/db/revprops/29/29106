john noticed that the -g and -G options were not working on the rt apps anymore due to the change to the default aspect from 1.0 to 0.0; and sure enough, he was right.  the aspect ratio change (made several years ago!) was for the -V view aspect option, but obviously had other users in other files that used the value.  this changes the default back to 1.0 while also adding a sanity check into the argument processor to make sure the aspect ratio is always a sane value.
