add a new script for generating the same style table as tracker.sh, but extracted from the NEWS file revision history. was written to work with svn commands, pulling the same data as it pertains to sf trackers using the commit history.  cross references the annotate revisions per-line with the commit log messages for those lines, and uses the NEWS file's simple format as an assumption for extracting the title and assignees.
