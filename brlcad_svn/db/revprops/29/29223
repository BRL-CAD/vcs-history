pix-png now warns the user if the PNG being created has image dimenions smaller than the PIX file that was given as input.  The tool compares the size of the input and output images, and reports the difference if there is one; it also suggest what flags the user may need to use if the input has recognizable image dimensions.  This feature was implemented in response to a support request from Mallory where he was confused by the black PNG image produced (which happened to be the top of the input PIX image) since he had not specified the input image dimensions.
