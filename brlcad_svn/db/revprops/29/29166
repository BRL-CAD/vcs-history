the old cray cos and unicos code for the cray xmp and friends finally became a burden to maintain while resolving various flawfinder issues.  remove the old code, particularly that which wasn't __STDC__.  however, intentionally leave the code for calculating byteoffsets and converting float formats to/from network order .. could still come in handy at some point down the road.
