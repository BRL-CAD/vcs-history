remove the various Ikonas writer utilities that have been disabled from compilation (now that they're all updated, ugh) since they require an unspecified header and need maintenance updates. until someone needs them again, they can stay stashed in the bowels of revision history.  includes pix-filt-ik, pix-ik, pix-ikr, pix-lowp-ik, pixt-ik.
