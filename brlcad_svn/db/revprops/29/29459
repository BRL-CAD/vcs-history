annotate the opengl display manager problems where the display doesn't automatically update any longer if the context is invalidated; mention that the libfb ogl interface seems horribly broken at the moment as it just crashes (consistently, at least on Mac OS X); and mention that the open dialog problems seem to be Mac OS X specific too as they worked under Linux (7.10.1 Mac also seemed to work fine, so something since then).

END
