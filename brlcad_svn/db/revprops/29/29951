new example footer using c-file-style so that the style is encouraged more strictly.  setting the c-file-style effectly causes a c-set-style to get invoked for that buffer, with the predefined 'stroustrup' style most closely matching our convention (it's basically 'k&r' with 4-char indents),  this fixes the braindead default 'gnu' style emacs uses that indents the c-offsets-alist substatement-open style parameter a level (i.e., open brace curlies are indented a level ahead of the proceeding statement).
