user-visible change.. removed longjmp warning message from applications that was called during bu_bomb's where an application exception handler was registered.  this was a common cause for confusion in the converters that use the jump handler during normal operations quite frequently -- made it look like the application was repeatedly 'crashing' during conversion yet the application would keep processing.

END
