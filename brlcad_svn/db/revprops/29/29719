remove a whole bunch of function checks that can be taken for granted since c89 provides for them.  all of these functions are apparently not even used (any more) via HAVE_ decls regardless.  removing the checks reduces configure time signficantly.  function checks removed include atexit, fabs, floor, memchr, memmove, modf, pow, setlocale, sqrt, strcpy, strcspn, strpbrk, strrchr, strspn, strstr, strtol, strtoul, strtoull
