there is some nasty bug in nmg_misc.c where nmg_classify_s_vs_s() ends up in an infinite recursion, causing the paint_color to increment out of bounds and eventually resulting in an invalid point_meaning array index.  use an unsigned int instead of a char for the counter/arrayindex, but still add an explicit test as to whether the paint_color ends up out of bounds whereby we break out of the iteration.
