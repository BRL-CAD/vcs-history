wrong direction bob.. working to remove _all_ instances of _WIN32 not in a core library.  besides, using chmod() is actually has a fundamental race condition flaw that is a security violation; and causes the new flawfinder regression test to fail.  hopefully msvc has _fchmod() like the other posix funcs it supports prefixed.  if not, need to add a libbu compatibility routine.
