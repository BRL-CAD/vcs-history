make a note that the various *_version variables are all now *_version() functions now since 7.10.2 even though the globals were never intended for external use (they were in headers merely for compilation convenience as they were used across directories in multiple files).  additionally added, but not commented is the 'new' brlcad_version() function which isn't as library-specific as the other variables.
