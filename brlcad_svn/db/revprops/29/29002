BAM! .. lingering windows is now the default.  it only took hundreds of complaints and 20 years of development.  this change makes it the default for most of the existing active framebuffer interface types, also adding a \\t\ option to complement the existing \\l\ option to allow folks to obtain the previous behavior if needed.  all this mode code really should be consolidated and made consistent, but that is a chore for another day.
