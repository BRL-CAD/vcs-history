modify bu_temp_file() so that we can capture the name of the temporary file that was created along with the opened file descriptor.  this requires ditching tmpfile_s() entirely on windows since it returns anonymous files, instead providing an implementation of mkstemp() for platforms like Windows that don't provide it.
