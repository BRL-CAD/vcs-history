add new file stat routines to libbu, bu_file_readable() and bu_file_writable() and bu_file_executable(), for determining permissions on a given file name for the current user.  check the appropriate user, group, or other permission, and should work on windows too.  these routines make it easy to completely avoid access() as well as a means to improve error checking throughout.
