prevent crashing on a whole slew of cases where we end up iterating over either a null, uninitialized, or malformed list item.  the current for loop while condition has to be non-NULL in order to do the next iteration, so make sure of it.  this prevents a crash that was detected in the display geometry object (where it had unitialized data).
