refactor and use the new bu_exit() instead of bombing on normal exit conditions.  also fix a bug where specifying the the same filename for the dxf and g file would result in it actually 'working' because it called wdb_open() to open/create the the .g output file before checking if the dxf exists.  really minor but happened to run into it when 'dxf-g asdf asdf' surprisingly completed successfuly
