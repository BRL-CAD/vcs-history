add initial implementation of bu_strlcat() and bu_strlcpy() that provide safe wrappers around the string functions of similar name.  if they're not available, then the strn family are used and appropriate null-termination behavior is matched from the strl family.  warnings are printed if we exceed the specified max size.  similar to bu_strdup(), the interface is wrapped in macros so that we can report file:line numbers when there is a problem. additionally, move bu_strdupm into here from malloc.c
