John Anderson improved the way the ted command in mged deals with ARBs that are less than ARB8s (e.g. an ARB6) .. instead of duplicating the points and requiring users to edit the duplications, only present them with the # points for their ARB#.  this fixes a bug report submitted by karel/clock3 where there was unexpected behavior that the edits where intenional and that the user had to edit the duplicates ([ 1842596 ] ted on arbn6 doesn't change vertices)
