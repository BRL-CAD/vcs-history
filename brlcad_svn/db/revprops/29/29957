only look for the tclConfig.sh and tkConfig.sh files if we're not building tcl or tk and need to load the config, otherwise having TCL_BIN_DIR set isn't too useful (the --with/--without flags are still available).  this should fix the configure exit being encountered on some systems when a system tcl/tk isn't already installed (i.e., the WARNING: Can't find Tcl configuration definitions 'error')
