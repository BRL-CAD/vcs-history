yet another restructuring of the init routine.  give Tcl_Init() a chance to work before calling tclcad_auto_path() so that we don't end up trying to force the init.tcl that is provided in the source distribution.  if there's a system tcl being used, it will gawk at trying to load the wrong init script.  this goes even further such that we keep track of which packages init properly and only call tclcad_auto_path() if one of them fail (or when we get to the brl-cad lib loading) using a two-pass loop.
