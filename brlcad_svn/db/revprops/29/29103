change wdb_tree_cmd() to dgo_tree_cmd() so that we can have access to the display geometry (particularly, to get access to the 'who' command).  modify the behavior of the mged 'tree' command so that if you don't provide it any options, it will display the tree for all objects displayed.  this is in response and inspired by a tcl snippet from david loman that needed this functionality to aid in analyzing gqa output.
