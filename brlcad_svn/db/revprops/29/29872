fix at least one race-condition problem with parallel crash report generation.  acquire a semaphore when printing into the tracefile filename and acquire the BU_SEM_SYSCALL semaphore when printing so we don't interleave with other printing that may be going on.  do the same when printing the intentional core dump message.
