variety of minor restructuring. use bu_brlcad_data more intelligently/consistently relying on it also working with uninstalled builds.  disable the splash logo since tkimg isn't integrated correctly yet (still also have a problem with blt too).  get rid of the massive auto_path hack since that's handled by libtclcad/bwish much more aggressively.
