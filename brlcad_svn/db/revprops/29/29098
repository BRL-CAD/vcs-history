update to the latest API changes where create_body_from_surfs() seems to have chnaged to create_solid_bodies_from_surfs() in the GeometryModifyTool class.  looks like it just changed to return a list of bodies instead of one body, so we iterate over the bodies.  this is entirely untested, but seems right according to the docs at https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/ITAPS/cgm/trunk/geom/
