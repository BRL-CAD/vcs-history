if we encounter an invalid shell with bad results, stop processing entirely.  this avoids an avalanche of cascaded failures and potential bomb situations where we can usually proceed.  this particular problem was encountered during g-iges that had a shell that could not be classified (resulted in infinite loop and array indices that went out of bounds, eventually crashing).
