beef up the IRIX readme with addition details encountered with the problem I ran into with (yet another stupid) libtool linkage problems/bugs.  more specifically, libtool was leaving out three librt object files that were in the librt_nil.la convenience library.  turns out they were getting prelinked into a '.al' pre-link archive with just the .l nm symbol instead of .lo causing subsequent linkage failures due to the symbols that get left out.
