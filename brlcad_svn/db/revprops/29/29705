include a comprehensive list of c89 functions that I'm aware of that should be a near-complete list of functions we should be able to rely on.  this does NOT include some of the POSIX.1 functions, but it should be a near-complete list otherwise.  functions compiled from the following headers: assert.h ctype.h locale.h math.h setjmp.h signal.h stdarg.h stddef.h stdio.h stdlib.h string.h time.h
