the libraries really need to libadd all of their requisite dependencies or there will be unresolved symbols on platforms; this isn't just a libtool issue (libtool needs this info).  this change will hopefully help the build on a few other platforms, though I suspect there are still a few obscure cases (with buggy libtool) where unresolved symbols might be encountered with dynamic/shared libadd libraries not getting carried through to the linker line for binaries.
