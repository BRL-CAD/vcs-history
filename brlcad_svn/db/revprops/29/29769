update the pro/engineer exporter so that it not only checks if an object named 'top' already exists, but it will attempt to use various 'top.#' alternative names in order to avoid a clash and still create a top-level object for the user.  this should fulfill the second half of sf request [ 1159469 ] "Pro/E converter improvements".  this mod is alas untested because I don't have protk at the moment.
