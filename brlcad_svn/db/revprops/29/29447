comment on the extensive DEPRECATED nature of the defines, types, and values provided by this file indicating whether it's a symbols that's going away, turning into a compile- or run-time check, or simply moving somewhere else.  ultimately, this entire header should get absorbed into other headers (particularly those of libbu), though the method differs for each symbol.
