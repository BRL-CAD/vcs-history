All the auto-configuration of machinetype moved to runtime
from conf.h.
This was necessary because the cake binary may be moved between
different machines which can still run CAKE, but which need different
cc options to build the BRL-CAD tools.
For example, moving an Irix 5.3 cake binary onto an Irix 6.2/3/4 platform.
