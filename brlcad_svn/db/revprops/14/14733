The a_onehit improvements in revision 11.17 resulted in many
more ray/solid intersections being performed than were done
in the Release 4.4 code; all the additional ones were unnecessary.
This resulted in a noticable code slowdown.
Now have much more precise checking of when a partition is
eligible for _correct_ evaluation, preventing bad results
as well as reducing un-needed intersections.
