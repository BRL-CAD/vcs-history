Fixed in-core buffering to operate on the array subscripts, rather than
a (char *) pointer, as this is more portable, and avoids CRAY problems.
In addition, turned off the in-core buffering on CRAY1 (and X and Y)
systems, as it consumes an extra 256 Kbytes, which on smaller Crays
isn't worth it.  Their I/O is plenty fast, and memory is usually tight.
