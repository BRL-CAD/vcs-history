added supoort for the Iris indigo entry level workstation.
Currently it only supports single buffer mode since the double buffer
scheme only uses 1 bit red, 2 bits green, 1 bit blue, The INV_LIGHT
name changes in release 4.0.3 with the introduction of the ELAN graphics,
but I will have to work on that later(when I have a ELAN system on hand)
