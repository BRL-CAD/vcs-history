Modified to fix Carol Ellis bug.
When multiple instances of a solid that failed to prep were cleaned up,
the references in the tree were not cleaned up first.
New strategy is to walk each tree twice.
First to change dead solid to OP_NOP nodes.
Then to optimize all OP_NOP nodes out of the tree.
And only *then* eliminate solids from the soltab list.
