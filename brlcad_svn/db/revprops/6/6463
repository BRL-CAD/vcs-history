Fixed handling of normals, was flipping them in place (in the hit struct),
now we make a private copy and flip it; required passing entry and/or
exit normals down to some functions.  The exit angle was being computed
from a reversed normal, also the sine of the fallback angle was negated.
Format of azimuth changed to 9.4f from 8.4 to allow for large negative
values (ie -270.0000).
