Improved overlap handling by separating policy from mechanism.
Which of two overlapping regions is given claim to the partition
is now determined by the user's a_overlap handler, and the
library simply implements that choice.
The default overlap handler has several new heuristics to try and
make more consistent choices, which in at least some cases seems
to be the right thing to do.
