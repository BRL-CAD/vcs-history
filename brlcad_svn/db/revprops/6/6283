1. Fixed linked list of outitems in parse_fmt().
   Code expected the list to be terminated by OUTITEM_NULL,
   but it forgot to set the pointer in newly created node.
2. Patched two memory leaks:
   - It now rt_frees char *uos (actually char *mycopy)
   - It now rt_frees the previous list of output items
     (using free_ospec()) before installing a new list.
