With the new "improved" ANSI cpp, lines that end in backslash causes
newlines to be embedded in in the cpp output, if there would be no
harm to a C program.  Problem is, Cakefiles are not C programs, and
the grammar is a bit fussier about white space.
In particular, it is important that every rule (target: dependencies)
must exist on a SINGLE LINE when cake gets to see it.
