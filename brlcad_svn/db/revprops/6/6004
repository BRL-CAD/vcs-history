Added bounds checking on reg_trees[].
Changed from malloc to calloc for reg_trees[], so that unfilled entries
would become NULL.
Fixed bug where return from db_tally_subtree_regions() was ignored;
under certain circumstances (bad solids, empty regions, etc),
there may be fewer regions to operate on than expected.
