Removed incorrect code about "MATE vertex topologically on isect plane".
Added code to check for start point of edge being exactly ON the
isect plane, when edge dir vector lies in the face of the other plane;
a case where rt_isect_ray_plane() returns "miss" because of the
infinite number of hits (a line's worth).
