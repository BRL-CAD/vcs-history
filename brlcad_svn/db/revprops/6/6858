Fixed bug where unusual image sizes would result in unfull image
blocks.  This could produce stripes at the top of the image, or
worse, some printer wouldn't print anything as a result.
Made page centering the default and added -l lower-left option.
Sped it up quite a bit by adding a hexout routine (sans printf).
