Now explicitly set a_onehit to 2 for light visibility rays,
to ensure getting a valid out hit (required for filter glass,
and almost always a no-cost option), rather than using main ray's
value of a_onehit, which might have been 0 (expensive!) or 1 (wrong!).

Added ray advance distance of rti_tol.dist up off surface, when
shooting light visibility rays.
This is necessary (at least) for viewing the Utah Teapot with
explicit lights.  It is unclear just how much the ray really should
be advanced.
