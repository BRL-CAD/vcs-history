Moved optical shaders from rt/ to liboptical/
The only modifications involved moving and splitting
rt/material.h into h/shadefuncs.h and h/shadework.h,
and in changing the calling sequence to mlib_setup() in rt/material.c

Now the only shader function called directly by RT is
in liboptical/init.c: optical_shader_init().
It adds all the individual shaders to the "mfuncs" shader list.
