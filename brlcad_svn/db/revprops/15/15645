Added rt_table_find_x(), as a centralized and robust way of locating
the span containing a given X value. Modified rt_table_lin_interp() to
use it, which cleaned the code up quite a bit. Changed
rt_tabdata_resample(), which had bad aliasing, into
rt_tabdata_resample_max() and rt_tabdata_resample_avg().

END
