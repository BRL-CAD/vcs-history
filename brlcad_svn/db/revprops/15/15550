#  Nearly everything responds to the environment variable BRLCAD_ROOT,
#  and either obtains it in C by calling bu_brlcad_path(),
#  or in scripts via "machinetype.sh -v".
#  Cake has been modified to pluck BRLCAD_ROOT out of it's envinronment
#  and send it through to CPP, so even the Cakefiles can see it.
