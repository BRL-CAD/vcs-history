*- added eoformat_string to control format of entry strings
*- added eoinc_operation and eodec_operation to control increment
   and decrement of entry values
*- when checking for the existence of the editor, instead of complaining,
   raise the editor and return
*- when creating for the first time, make the editor appear to the
   lower right of mouse pointer
*- modify eoinc and eodec to NOT apply changes, that's what the "Apply"
   button is for.
*- display info in local units and assume the same when applying to database
