Changed terminology from "widget" to "newprocname", as
these procs have nothing to do with Tk widgets.
Needed to move "dont_instance" flag out of "prep" and into "rt_gettrees",
as it has to be set _before_ doing the treewalking.
Now it's a -i option to rt_gettrees.
If st_path has been set in a soltab, print it.
