Move the surface fitting code into its own function, add in some edge points from the nurbs curves to the fit, change the face generation to not automatically create loops for the surfaces.  This currently produces an invalid brep with a 'has no loops' error, but that's expected - we now need to generate our own trimming loops using the surface/loop/edge information and pullback_curve.
