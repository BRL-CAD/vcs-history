Update to function "nmg_loop_plane_area2" in file "nmg_misc.c". This change was for code cleanup and improve floating point precision. Added two new macros to file "vmath.h" named "VCLAMP" and "HCLAMP" which clamps values near zero to zero within a 3D or 4D vector. Also changed files "bn.h" and "mat.c" to change the parameter types for function "bn_mat_fromto".
