Updated functions "ged_bot_fuse", renamed function "_ged_show_dangling_edges" to "show_dangling_edges". Added the ability of the mged command "bot_fuse" to be passed a "-p" to create a plot file of the open edges or "-s" to show the open edges on the display. The number of open edges is counted and reported.
