turns out that BRLCAD_INCLUDE_FILE is only searching in system include dirs (and the appended /usr/local/include required dir) but not any of the X11 include paths.  regardless, we don't need to retry the search since we found it or not during FindX11 checking.  Just add our config file entry accordingly.
