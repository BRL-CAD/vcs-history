avoid throwing exceptions due to max() being bigger than actually supported.  seems like an stl exception bug given it throws a length_error exception and the parameter is supposed to default to the value we're setting, but work around it anyways.  we just set npos and avoid specifying a constructor limit if the value is npos.
