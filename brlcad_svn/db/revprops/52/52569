exact floating point comparisons are bad, but the patch included one too.  moreover, looks like the mod should be altogether unnecessary since we can just call Length().  looks like the change messes with the header's documented notion of a singleton.  probably worth discussing with rhino folks if we need to clean it up since there are other exact comparisons.
