Updates to functions "nmg_crackshells" and "nmg_isect_two_generic_faces" within file "nmg_inter.c". Changed the macro comparing the face bounding boxes so that the face bounding boxes must be at least distance tolerance apart to be excluded from further testing instead of not overlapping by at least distance tolerance. This prevents missing intersections of faces where they are axis aligned and the face bounding boxes are less than distance tolerance apart.
