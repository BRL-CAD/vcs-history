apply sf patch 3562423 (if_wgl.c gets to be single buffer by default) from Niculaescu Oana ( elf11 ) so that it matches the ogl framebuffer.  now defaults to single-buffering in order to avoid massive performance degredation when rendering to large framebuffer windows (reported by several TMT users)
