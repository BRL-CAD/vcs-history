Added two subcommands for the 'graph' command: 'show' and 'positions'. Removed the previous 'graph_objects_positions' and 'graph_structure' commands. Renamed the previously named Tcl 'graph' procedure into 'igraph' - this command launches the interactive graph; along with this procedure, the src/tclscripts/graph was renamed into src/tclscripts/igraph, and the file src/tclscripts/graph/graph.tcl was renamed into src/tclscripts/igraph/igraph.tcl. The 'igraph' command works in MGED; when launched in Archer, an error message in outputted saying that the command is not available yet.
END
