Changed the name of function "nmg_isect_lseg3_eu" to "nmg_isect_potcut_fu" which better describes its purpose. Also the first two input parameters were changed from vertexuse to edgeuse. Updated function "nmg_triangulate_rm_holes" to call "nmg_isect_potcut_fu". These changes were in file "nmg_tri.c" and correct bugs with nmg triangulation.
