prevent a crash parsing entities intended for a different schema (e.g., ap204 data fed to ap203e2 schema parser).  eDesc was not being initialized causing random data crash/corruption.  even initialized, it ends up being null due to the schema entity mismatch for unrecognized entities, so have to prevent against dereferencing null elsewhere.
