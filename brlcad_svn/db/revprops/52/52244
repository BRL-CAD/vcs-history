quell compilation inline warnings from gcc 4.2 by increasing the inline limit to 300% per compilation unit.  this is an issue that is addressed better in later versions of the compile, but is exasperated by our file that has so much inlining and classes in one unit (opennurbs_ext.c).  intentionally grouping with the other gcc inline flag because they interrelate (and will be easier to find/update/keep together)
