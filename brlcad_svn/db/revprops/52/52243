fixed two bugs when shooting rays at a plate-mode bot, one being that it would outright crash (code assumed prep filled in per-face thickness information).  fixed to not crash, then support added to correctly initialize so LOS thickness get calculated correctly.  this was found investigating a 'bot tessellation failure' rtcmp issue reported recently by survice.
