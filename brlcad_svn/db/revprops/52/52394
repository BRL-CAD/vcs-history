apply sf patch 3565411 (The joint command from the libged library) from Niculaescu Oana ( elf11 ) moving the animedit/joint command from mged to libged.  this leaves one todo action for figuring out how to transition 'ghost' wireframe elements without carrying over the hack that mged used, but it's forward progress regardless.
