Start the process of subbing openNURBS types in for Eigen types.  We don't want to depend on Eigen - ideally, openNURBs natives types will be used as far as possible (i.e. up to the point of calling the actual solvers.)  Once this process is complete and the solver is verified to be still working, can start swapping in other solvers to see how they perform.
