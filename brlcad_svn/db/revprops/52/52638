Updated files "vmath.h", "nmg_fuse.c", "nmg_class.c", "nmg_mod.c", "nmg_inter.c" and "nmg_bool.c". Corrected a bug in macro "V3RPP_DISJOINT_TOL". Updated functions "nmg_two_face_fuse", "class_eu_vs_s", "nmg_shell_coplanar_face_merge", "nmg_isect_eu_eu" and "nmg_bool" to use the "V3RPP_DISJOINT_TOL" macro instead of "V3RPP_OVERLAP_TOL". This change corrects a problem where bounding boxes which were less than distance tolerance apart, but not overlapping, were being skipped.
