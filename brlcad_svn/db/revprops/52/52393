remove the old vrmgr 'Virtual Reality manager' interface to mged.  it provided a libpkg network interface to mged whereby you could feed mged commands remotely.  aside from being a gaping security hole riddled with problems due to a lack of sandboxing, it is no longer being used.  ironically, it's more of a geometry service than that 'other' effort ever became, but it's still not worth keeping.  the code needs updates and is accessing some functions that it shouldn't, so reduce becomes best.
