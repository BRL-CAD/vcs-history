cliff encountered a bug that I even thought about when rewriting all of this but forgot to revisit.  if you call bu_getprogname() even once, it will wipe out a full-path setting and bu_argv0_full_path() will only work if the progname is in the PATH.  this fix stashes the result in a local buffer before returning (in leu of creating another static global).
