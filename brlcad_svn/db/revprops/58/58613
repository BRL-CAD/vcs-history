This needs a lot more careful though, but if I'm thinking correctly about the implications of sorting a list of points in this fashion and the requirements of the Melkman polyline convex hull algorithm, the sorting of the list of points ends up creating a set of points that may be treated as defining line segments in a non-self-intersecting polyline (barring degenerate points, which come to think of it we may need to handle in melkman anyway) and hence the sorted point list can be fed directly to the melkman implementation rather than needing separate logic.
