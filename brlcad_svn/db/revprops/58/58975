updates to get BRL-CAD C source files compiled warning- and error-free
  with a C++ compiler:

added const (and casts) as necessary to eliminate many instances of:

  warning: deprecated conversion from string constant to 'char*' [-Wwrite-strings]

in the process had to add some char and const char variables for char
and const char pointer use

successful debug build on Debian 7, 64-bit:
  no warnings or errors (except for the usual from libgiam, tcl, and step)

successful 'make regress'

successful bu_redblack_test with 'make test'

END
