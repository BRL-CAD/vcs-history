Add the beginnings of style validation integration to BRL-CAD.  This approach uses a source code formatter (currently astyle) and treats any difference between astyle's output and the formatting of the source files in the target's sources list as a compilation-haulting error.  Currently enabled by ENABLE_STYLE_VALIDATION, but the astyle.opt file currently in use has nothing to do with what will be the final formatting standard - DO NOT MAKE SOURCE CODE FORMATTING CHANGES BASED ON CURRENT RESULTS!  Other TODO items for this feature - modularize BRLCAD_ADDLIB logic into macro and add to executables targets as well, incorporate per-target headers lists so we can also enforce good formatting behavior in headers, modularize to allow other formatters than astyle (in cause the LGPLv3 is any sort of problem down the road...), test on anything other than Ubuntu Linux... etc.
