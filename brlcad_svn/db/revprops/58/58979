Make a very strong effort to make sure file generation is complete for the step-g and g-step inputs - use a looping MD5 comparison script to make sure the file is stable over time before generate the stamp file rather than just creating the stamp after CMake thinks the exp2cxx process is complete.  Even this can be messed up by sufficiently bizarre I/O issues, but if a situation arises where the files are still changing even after being in a metastable state for a full second on the filesystem we can alter this setup and make the sleep length a parameter rather than fixing it at one second.
