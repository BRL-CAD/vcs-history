updates to get BRL-CAD C source files compiled warning- and error-free
  with a C++ compiler:

changing all struct bu_rb_walk visitor function pointer signatures so
they are cast to void when used as function args and then cast to the
proper signature when used as actual functions

added macros to bu.h to aid proper casting with expanded comments
about the process (names are not very imaginative)

successful debug build on Debian 7, 64-bit:
  no warnings or errors (except for the usual from libgiam, tcl, and step)

successful 'make regress'

successful bu_redblack_test with 'make test'

END
