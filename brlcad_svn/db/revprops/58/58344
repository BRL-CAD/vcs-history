merged commit r58167: Special configuration for MSVC++: MS Windows isn't an officially supported platform for TCLAP.  The library uses autotools/make which isn't available with Visual Studio.  Nevertheless TCLAP was made compilable in Visual Studio with an "#ifdef _MSC_VER".  This behavior has to be simulated in BRL-CAD's CMake configuration.
