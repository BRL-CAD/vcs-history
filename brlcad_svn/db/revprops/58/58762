Rework the pragma defines a bit - clang supports GCC style pragmas as a backwards compatibility measure, but we shouldn't count on that (plus we may need to fine tune options specifically for clang or GCC).  Also use expanded version in src/other gdiam sources to avoid introducing need for common.h there.
