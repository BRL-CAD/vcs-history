not that shared_ptr was inappropriate, but provided nothing compelling.  if you registered the same FILE* multiple times, there are other issues. it's not necessarily (portably) thread-safe or re-entrant to do that with a FILE* concurrently, accessing from multiple parsers simultaneously or (worse) different threads.  this change fixes a bug introduced in open_file() where it was closing an unset node.file but the equivalent behavior to previous via reset() would have been to close the shared_ptr FILE* and set to new file.  new version just sets to the new file (and now we no longer close it, which is a different issue to resolve but shouldn't be critial because nobody calls obj_parse()).
