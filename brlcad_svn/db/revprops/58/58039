Move src/other further down the configure process. Sean had the insight that now that we are clearing the build flags at the top of src/other, we can do all the system tests with BRL-CAD's compile flags up front so the CACHE holds the results one would expect from BRL-CAD's configuration rather than any that might get set with blank build flags in src/other.  The only danger is that the src/other builds, using the BRL-CAD cache results, might fail to build because they need something that passed in BRL-CAD's test but requires a flag not supplied in the src/other build logic.  In that situation, if it occurs, the thing to do is probably to improve/fix the src/other CMake logic.
