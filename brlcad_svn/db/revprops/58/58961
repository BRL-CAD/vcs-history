I think we're going to want to shrink the surfaces after this operation - very noticable in the sph - sph case when plotting the subtracted sphere surface.  If it proves to be a major performance issue or buggy may need to re-think, but otherwise should cut down on unnecessary intersection solving when walking up a tree
