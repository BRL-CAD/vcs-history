another powerful looping construct is a 'repeat' command, similar to the search and proposed batch commands.  it's a for-loop equivalent where you specify labels to iterate over and they are substituted into specified command(s) for execution.  really begs whether we want ';' separators like search (for consistency) or limit batch and repeat to single string commands.  if the prior, will need to ensure quoting resolution doesn't explode (if you make repeat call search or batch and vice versas).
