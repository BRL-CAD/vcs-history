Carbon process-related functions used in dm_applicationfocus are deprecated in OS X 10.9. Removing dm_applicationfocus, since it only applies to OS X, and XQuartz has a "Focus On New Windows" preference that allows you to accomplish the same thing (e.g. giving mged focus on startup). Removing dm_applicationfocus eliminates the need to check for Carbon in the first-party build logic.
