apply gci patch from johannes shulte that implements the volume callback for BoT meshes. more work is probably needed to make sure this method is only applied to volume mode BoT, but it looks like possibly a variation on the signed volume tetrahedron method. of course, untested.  http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2013/4814313936125952 (also has missing table.c for earlier rhc centroid patch)
