updates to get BRL-CAD C source files compiled warning- and error-free
  with a C++ compiler:

changing all struct bu_rb_tree comparison function pointer signatures

  from: int (**rbt_order)(void *, void *);
    to: int (**rbt_compar)(const void *, const void *);

also changing associated var names from "*order*" to "*compare*" to make clear distinction between rb tree order and node comparison

add new macro to aid casting comparison functions to function arguments

add casts as necessary to quell warnings and errors

successful debug build on Debian 7, 64-bit:
  no warnings or errors (except for the usual from libgiam, tcl, and step)

successful 'make regress'

successful bu_redblack_test with 'make test'

END
