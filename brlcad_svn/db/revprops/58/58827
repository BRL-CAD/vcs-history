This reverts r50778. rt_memfree() needs to continue in order to initialize *pp, otherwise curp and prevp will always be NULL. The short of it is that if we return early when (\!prevp || \!curp), the free memory nodes will never coalesce which results in the file size growing unnecessarily because it's being filled with contiguous free regions that are always seen seperately. Now that I think about it, it looks like the free regions were no longer getting on the freelist.
