updates to get BRL-CAD C source files compiled warning- and error-free
  with a C++ compiler:

+ move C child structs up to top level (no change to C scope but makes
  scope same in C++ so src/librt/cut.c will compile without error)

+ in rtgeom.h, struct rt_functab, increased size of two char arrays to
  make room for string-ending NULL for the current max length of the
  actual initialized strings being used



successful debug build on Debian 7, 64-bit:
  no warnings or errors (except for the usual from libgiam, tcl, and step)

successful 'make regress', 'make test', and 'make benchmark'

END
