Break out the comparison function - if we have been given a numerical tolerance, the value comparison just got a lot more complicated than string equality.  This is potentially extremely nasty - if units are specified in the general attribute/value system, then in prinicple we might want to do a numerically based comparision of those for equality as well, not just the internal parameters.  For the time being, until we get binary attributes, the numerical diffing should be restricted to the internal parameters.  We can probably recognize points/vectors and individual int/float number parameters, which should do for most of the 'normal' geometry dimensions.
