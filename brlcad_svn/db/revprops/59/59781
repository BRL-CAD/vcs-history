Eliminate our historic  F U N C _ H E A D E R S  in comments.  They're a development nuisance with a maintenance cost and their original purpose is no longer relevant.  There's no longer a need to distinguish public API comments from implementation function comments since all API comments are getting migrated to the include/ directory.  Moreovere, we have automatic tools (e.g., Doxygen) that can stylize and headerize automatically.

Done with two easy one-liners:
find . -type f \( -not -regex '.*other.*' -not -regex '.*svn.*' \) -exec perl -0777 -pi -e 's/ \*[[:space:]]*([[:alnum:]_] )+[[:alnum:]_]([[:space:]]*\([[:space:]]*\))*(\n \*[[:space:]]*)*\n//g' {} \;
find . -type f \( -not -regex '.*other.*' -not -regex '.*svn.*' \) -exec perl -0777 -pi -e 's/\/\*+[[:space:]]*(\n[[:space:]]*\*[[:space:]]*)*\n[[:space:]]*\*\/[[:space:]]*\n//g' {} \;

5900 lines eliminated including empty comment blocks.
