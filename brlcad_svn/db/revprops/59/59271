apply sf patch 251 from shardul chiplunkar, working under gci task http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2013/5240158668455936 which begins making a set of changes needed to get -Wstrict-prototypes working.  lots of complication and mess, with his patch ultimately being heavily modified in order to apply it (there were many bugs and issues that neede resolving).  mostly filling out a lot of parameter lists, but this did uncover issues in several places throughout the code.  redblack tree callbacks are particularly screwy and will need work to clean the interface up.  leaving -Wstrict-prototypes disabled for now as there is more work needed.
