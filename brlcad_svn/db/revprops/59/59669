rewrite bu_vls_nibble() so that it only performs unsigned math on the size_t struct elements.  this should appease compilers that don't realize we already accounted for negative nibbles that prevent vls_offset from ever underflowing beyond zero.  this is an overall readability cleanup anyways with comments added for good measure.  we make the len paramter an off_t to reflect it's offset characteristic (i.e., intentionally signed), even though the vls_offset field is intentionally unsigned (unfortunate pre-c99 name).
