More g_diff->library work, set up basic test case.  It looks like SplitList from Tcl will work for createing avs objects, and aside from that g_diff appears (at least, as far into this as I've current dug) to be way overusing the Tcl level of database interaction when lower levels will work fine - significant surgery indicated.
