apply gci patch http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2013/5315017800941568 from maths22 which enables -Wbad-function-cast to detect wrong/dangerous/suspicious casts.  mostly caught a lot of unintentional integer truncation from functions that return floating point values, but also barked on a couple snippets of bad practice where a pointer was serialized to a string and back.
