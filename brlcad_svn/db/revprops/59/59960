Test a few .c files including individual bu/ headers.  Seems to work, but want to be very sure we have completed reorg before going through all the BRL-CAD srcs to do this.  Worth doing in the end, because this is what will help compile times (using only the bits of bu.h needed, not all of bu.h all the time.)
