And this is why the search API was still flagged as WIP.  Consolidate plan testing, flat vs. tree-aware searching, single dp vs dp array inputs, and full_path vs. unique dp return types into a single db_search function that accepts flags to control its behavior and a db_free_search_tbl function that can handle either result type.  Code reduction and simplification overall - barring some major missing considerations, this is most likely the final form of the C search API.  Needs a fair bit of testing, as the change was a bit invasive - particularly when it comes to things like hidden objects.
