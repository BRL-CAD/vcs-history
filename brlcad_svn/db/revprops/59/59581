We need to do something if the brep conversion fails, otherwise the STEP writer crashes trying to write its output (and we crash before that trying to build the structure, for similar reasons.)  AP203 doesn't seem to allow for a 'null' object - may need to fall back on the bbox idea, as well as dealing with half (for which bbox isn't very effective...)
