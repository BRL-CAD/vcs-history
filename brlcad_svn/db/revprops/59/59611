Document in some detail why we're going to have a problem with scaling matricies in our comb hierarchies when exporting to STEP.  Need to think about our options here - in principle we could do an 'in-memory' application of the matricies ourselves, but that amounts to a duplication of the xpush logic in the converter.  We don't want to simply run xpush on the existing .g database, because conversion shouldn't change the existing data.  For now, simply print a message warning about the problem and pointing the user to xpush - that'll at least be informative until we decide on a solution.
