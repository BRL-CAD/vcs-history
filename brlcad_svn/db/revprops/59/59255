Wrap some printout in the debug conditional, call the full interesct routine on coplanar surfaces again.  Taking apart the s5-s6 comb brep conversion in m35.g reveals that the two sides with extra material aren't excess faces that got added to the brep but rather the original sides that never got the necessary trimming curves.  The extra debugging statements added seem to indicate errors on 2 out of three of the coplanar face intersections where the 'correct direction' o f the overlap event cannot be determined.  Not sure yet if those are the same interactions resulting in the trimming errors.
