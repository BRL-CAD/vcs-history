write a dissertation on how to resolve grazing hits consistently across all primitives.  this is an ancient discussion, but one we constantly are revisiting every time we change behavior (because we don't have a definition of good/bad behavior).  presently, all primitives just do their own thing, maybe returning a graze, maybe not.  maybe resulting in an overlap, maybe not.  this prescribes a consistent definition so we can get reliable behavior and improved usability.  read for details, feedback welcome.
