minimally impacting change lets us eliminate all of the libbn numeric constant globals (bn_pi, bn_twopi, bn_halfpi, bn_quarterpi, bn_invpi, bn_inv2pi, bn_inv4pi) in favor of the standard and extended math M_ constants.  the degree/radian macros were completely duplicative, so they can just go away.  the only remaining is 1/255 which we can move into header land as a macro value for consistency.
