Move the summary formatting and printing functionality *entirely* into the diff tester.  The intent is to demonstrate that code can call the diff_dbip and/or diff_dp functions and, using the new accessor functions, create any formatted output they might want.  Probably don't have quite enough functionality as yet to dupliate all of g_diff's features, but looks promising.
