make the repository script accommodate pathnames with spaces and special characters.  started to accommodate it proper, but realized the easiest solution is to just change to the src directory.  we can do that because we don't actually write out anything nor rely on anything outside the source dir.  this should accommodate the regression-full odd pathname test.  included an example of how scripting is done with odd pathnames for reference in case it's needed elsewhere.
