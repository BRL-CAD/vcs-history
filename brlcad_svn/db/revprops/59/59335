Per suggestion from Sean, rather than have diff comparision logic on a per-primitive basis, use the notion of bu_avs conversion of primitive parameters to 'convert' all information about a primitive into an attribute value set, and then have *all* the diffing logic concentrated into a single libbu avs diffing routine.  This reworks the original notion of a per-primitive 'diff' routine to be instead a per-primitive 'avs' routine that will translate each primitive's specific fields into avs entries.
