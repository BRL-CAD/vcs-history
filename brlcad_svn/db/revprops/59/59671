remove the duplicitous bu_vls_trunc2() function in favor of bu_vls_trunc().  difference was trunc2 ignoring negative values whereas trunc treated them as offsets from the end (instead of a length).  instances are trivially updated to using trunc() so just remove it wholesale as minimally impacting.
