fix a behavior bug in mk_arbn() where it was releasing the caller's eqn parameter even though the comment says it won't and intention is to not.  here we make a copy and mark the parameter as const for future consistency.  update asc2g and comgeom-g to reflect (which were inconsistent themselves).  bug noticed by ncsaba__ using kanzure's python-brlcad interface.
