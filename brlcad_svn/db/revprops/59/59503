reverting changes from revision 59482 (and 59483): It isn't possible to include other Windows API headers after bio.h because important macros from windows.h are undefined here.  E.g. winsock2.h requires the "IN" macro.  If this header file will be included after bio.h (with WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN) it doesn't process windows.h again and assumes the presence of IN.
END
