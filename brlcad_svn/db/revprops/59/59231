improved/fixed a performance problem identified in libbn's noise interface which is used by the 'terrain' tool as well as a number of shaders including the air, camo, fbm, fire, grass, noise, and scloud shaders.  should noticably improve regression performance (shaders test).  slow-down issue was introduced around the 7.14 line.
