After closer study of and experimentation with the ogl display manager, it is clear that the initial creation of the Tk window needs dm_width and dm_height values based on the screen size.  *Why* this is the case isn unclear and apparently undocumented.  Same for the 30 pixel offset subtracted from the initial values in ogl.  Have left out the subtraction for now - if it proves to be needed, hopefully it will also be clear then *why* it's needed...
