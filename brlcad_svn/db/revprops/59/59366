Punt on the tolerance based diffing question for now.  Need primitives that can supply dimensional (and possibly unit) information about their parameters upon request, so a comparison function can know if it makes sense to compare two things using a dimensional tolerance or not.  (Not all numerical parameters are guaranteed to be in units of mm, or even guaranteed to represent length.)  This is particularly important when doing differences between unlike object types - let's say, for example, a user wants a diff between a sph and an arb8, and wants to know which if any of the arb8 vertices are within tol of the sph's vertex. A diff between the two sets of object parameters with a filter to report elements that are the same within a supplied dimensional tolerance would quickly identify a candidate vertex out of the arb, but that comparison needs information for dimensional analysis instead of just numerical diffing.
