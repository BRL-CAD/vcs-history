undo r59655 as the 'offset' most definitely should not be signed.  if it's ever a negative value, our routines will heartily crash.  the msvc warning was almost certainly due to trickery in bu_vls_nibble() which lets one unroll an offset back to zero (i.e., it's a false positive, but a really hard one to detect).  need to fix the nibbler.
