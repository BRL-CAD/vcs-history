Start roughing in a librt primitive API call that will diff a primitive with another instance of that same primitive type and report two sets of bu_avs entires holding information about differences (entries present in one list but absent in the other are newly added or vanished, whereas keys present in both lists differ in their value assignments.)  Since primitives will differ either in their parameters (specific to each primitive type) or their assigned attributes (generic) the two avs lists should be able to hold all necessary information required for generating diff reports.
