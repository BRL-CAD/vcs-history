updates to get BRL-CAD C source files compiled warning- and error-free
  with a C++ compiler:

+ changing var names using C++ keywords 'class' and 'this'

+ making explicit casts to receiving objects (LHS) to quell errors and
  warnings

successful debug build on Debian 7, 64-bit:
  no warnings or errors (except for the usual from libgiam, tcl, and step)

successful 'make regress'
