almost premature since it's still not exposed to the user, but we need to call out the substantial work that's now gone into implementing nurbs boolean evaluation.  Wu worked on it hard for a couple summers (arguably a couple staff-years worth of time) and cliff and nick have made a number of improvements and fixes since too.
