The casting warning flag broke the time delta mechanism.  Made a stab at reworking the timeend_delta file to use floating point to avoid casting to int, but this requires fmod which in turn requres M_LIBRARY on platforms that use a math library.  This is an unfortunate complication to the time delta calculation logic, which needs to be as simple and self-contained as possible for portability.  It may be time to look at using the new CMake functionality for timestamps and simply skip the timing check on any CMake too old to support it - the maintenance overhead of maintaining our own portable C code for this is probably not worthwhile if CMake's functionality can indeed supply a viable alternative.
