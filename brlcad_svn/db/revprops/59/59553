Fix segfault introduced when creation of curves_array was moved to a separate function. Assigning the result of the function failed because ON_ClassArray<T>::operator= only copies m_count items, and m_count is typically only incremented when using Append(), whereas we're indexing directly into pre-allocated space. Incrementing the count manually fixes the problem until we can split the array and switch to using Append().
