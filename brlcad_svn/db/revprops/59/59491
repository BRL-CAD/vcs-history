add a test for platform identifiers being used in logic in an effort to curtail adding any more than we already have.  with feature-based testing, it should be possibly to get the number of instances down into single-digits (currently at 79).  it's a little more work in the short term, but the more robust solution over time.  moreover, the assumption is often wrong when compiling with something other than msvc and on newer releases where they've implemented standard library functionality that was previously missing.
