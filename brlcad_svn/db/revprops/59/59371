Use bu_ptbl to hold diff results, and have the summary function take that data set as an input rather than calling it from within diff_dbip.  A more powerful diff_report funcion or possibly a set of such functions is probably in order.  It may even be advisable to define a 'function access' API that gives access to the specific elements of a gdiff_result without exposing the structure itself... need to think about what best practice is here.
