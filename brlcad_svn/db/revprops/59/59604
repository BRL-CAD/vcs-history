Hmm - even at VUNITIZE_TOL some of the scaling looks non-uniform.  For AP203 non-uniform scaling is extremely problematic and may yet end with a request for an xpush on the offending comb, so need to figure out if we can be more forgiving here... or perhaps the test itself needs to be changed somehow...
