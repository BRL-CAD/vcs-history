There is no obvious need to instantiate multiple versions of the BANode or BVNode template classes at once, and their implementations require the template parameter to have an interface similar to ON_BoundingBox. Simplify things by converting BANode and BVNode to concrete classes that use ON_BoundingBox, and rename them to BRNode and BBNode respectively rather than having BRNode and BBNode be typedefs. Making the classes concrete allows the non-inline member definitions to be moved into separate source files.
