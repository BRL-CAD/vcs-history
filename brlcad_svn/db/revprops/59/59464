in process of debugging the bu_vls_strncat failure I tool the liberty of improving disgnostic output to show the effects of casting from a negative integer to a size_t; also renamed some vars to make it clear how the test is being conducted and used the new literals PASS and FAIL for clarity and correct results values for pass/fail
