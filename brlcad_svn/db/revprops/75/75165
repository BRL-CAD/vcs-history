A significant bump in the road - CMake's dependency resolution doesn't include completing external projects before building main build source files.  It'll try to build in anticipation of linking, but if the headers haven't been positioned by the external project's install step the build just fails.  Apparently this is a known issue - see https://blog.kitware.com/cmake-superbuilds-git-submodules/ - and the normal fix is that there is one parent build whose job it is to manage all the others.  I'm not at all sure yet what this would look like for a BRL-CAD build...
