Make another try at detecting the Tcl/Tk graphics system.  Tk's API doesn't let us get at the info without doing a Tk_Init, which won't succeed in headless configurations as we can't initialize a window.  This is a hard problem since Tk provides not proper way to do it - even building a program against libtk.so doesn't work as the lower level library calls that might let us get directly at the needed information are marked static.  So we instead try to read the information directly out of the TK_LIBRARY's printable strings - Tk stores the windowingsystem command output as a string, so in princple it is there for us to find.
