Making a simpler example to test the behavior of multiple threads sending each other events.  Looks like key missing ingredient in earlier test was that the worker thread has to have its own Tcl interp to process events successfully - it's not backed in to the basic thread setup.  With this setup, the goal is eventually val2 and val3 get large enough that the program exits if you resize the Tk window - so far it looks like it works.
