Add a minimal example showing the combination of configure_file and generator expressions being used for runtime identification of the current BRL-CAD root hierarchy path in build scripts.  This is a bit tricky, but should be a bit more 'standard' than the CURRENT_PATH custom mechanism originally added years ago for pre-generator-expressions CMake builds to achieve the same result.  Regression tests are using this method currently - next step will be to convert the DocBook logic to using it.  It's not clear yet if the build-type based install path customization can use this approach.  (Some portion of it will have to persist regardless, as the once-per-configuration-change logic that reworks the install files to update their paths depends on the current-configuration-named file not being present on the filesystem to trigger.)
