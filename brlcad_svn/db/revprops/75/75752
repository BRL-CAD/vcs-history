AH! A subtle problem with the ENABLE_ALL build - if the build decided to go ahead and do libged-obj as one of the first builds (which it could because the obj build didn't have dependencies set up - they're on the lib target itself) and it was using the bundled png, it wouldn't be able to build successfully because pnglibconf.h is generated by the png build.  Since it wasn't firing, libged-obj would only complete successfully if it could a) find a pnglibconf.h somewhere else (which it apparently does on some systems, even though with ENABLE_ALL it would be better not to) or b) the ordering the build tool picked happend to produce pnglibconf.h before getting the the libged-obj build.  Fix this by checking the libs list for build targets, and if any are found make the object library target dependent on them so we don't start on the lib objects until everything they depend on is done.
