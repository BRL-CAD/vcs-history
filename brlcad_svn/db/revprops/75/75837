This gets the 4 missing libged commands building, but not working.  Apparently these were libtclcad only commands, and the framebuffer server fbp is distinct from the dm's embedded framebuffer so this change isn't manipulating the same fbp.  It looks at this point like the framebuffer object/server code in libtclcad needs to be modded to use the libged dm existing framebuffer as its target/container, or (maybe better) we just remove these 4 libged functions and recast them as libtclcad specific functionality/commands that can reference the libtclcad data structures directly.
