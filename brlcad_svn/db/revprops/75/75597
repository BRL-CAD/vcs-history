Grr.  A quick check doesn't find any way to package require Tk without the graphics window initialization, which precludes getting tk windowingsystem to reliably return in headless configuration.  Only an issue on OSX at the moment, and will not be an issue there if we shift to cross-platform DM/FB backends...
