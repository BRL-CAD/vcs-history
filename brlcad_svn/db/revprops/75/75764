Will have to deprecate the original bot arg ordering - bot get is used, and bot check is also documented.  That constrains how self-contained we can make subcommands and still do the object verification in one place, since we need to do some argv management up front to match the old behavior (ick.)  Might be better to wrap the object lookup and check into a function and call it in each subcommand - will need to experiment.
