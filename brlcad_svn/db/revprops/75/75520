As expected, the fbserv use of Tcl is the last non-backend piece in the libdm/libfb stack.  Will also be a thorny one - we're relying on Tcl channels on Windows to successfully do the async raytracing to the MGED/Archer display windows, if I recall correctly - that's a key feature which has to be kept working.
