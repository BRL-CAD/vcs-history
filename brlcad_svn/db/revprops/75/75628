Needs to be hammered on/thought on a bit more, but set up the image test to use ephemeral rendering threads that are managed by an update manager that operates based on events.  Idea is to completely avoid time-based polling to see if work needs to be done, but also to avoid having a lot of rendering events piling up in an event queue and trialing on after we stop resizing.  The update manager takes the events and either triggers a render or keeps track of the need to do another render once the current one finishes.  The render thread notifies the update manager once it is complete via an event, which will kick off the GUI window update and (if needed) start another render pass.  Otherwise, everything waits for a toplevel action to kick things off.
