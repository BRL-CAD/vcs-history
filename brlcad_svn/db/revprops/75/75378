Work around the rtedge -W problem reported by a user where the rtedge lines are still drawn white even though the white background is specified.  This broke in commit r68597, but it looks as if the implementation even prior to that does what's intended rather oddly, in a way only considered the -W white background case.  -C 240/240/240, for example, does not produce the dark line but is clearly a background that would benefit from it.  Only -W changes the default_background flag internally, but adjusting -C to do the same won't do either, since -C 1/1/1 would then produce a black line and a black-on-black image.  The correct answer is to calculate a color difference metric, but until that's solved this should restore the black/white and white/black cases where are the most common for line drawings.
