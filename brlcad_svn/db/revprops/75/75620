There we go.  Tcl/Tk application with a rendering thread that's updating a local pixel buffer and triggering update events in the parent, which reads that buffer and updates its Tk_Photo accordingly.  Incorporates a delay in the rendering thread to simulate a slow rendering pass.  Doesn't start a new rendering pass until the previous one is done - we don't want to waste time catching up through a ton of queued rendering passes which are already obsolete.  However, it should always end up doing the 'final' rendering pass once things stabelize, as the last movement will either coincide with the last rendering trigger or will set the flag to do another rendering pass once the rendering thread completes its current work.
