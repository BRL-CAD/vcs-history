Merge bioh branch addition of fvisibility=hidden back into trunk.  This will exercise what had previously been Windows-only logic for hiding library internal symbols during compilation, and eliminate one of the common sources of Windows build problems introduced by development on other platforms.  The practical consequence visible to developers will be that *_EXPORT labeling of public functions in headers will now be necessary for all platforms, not just Windows.
