Got the Tcl/Tk 8.6 build up and running, so immedate impetus for ExternalProject_Add work is alleviated.  Make a note about where to start if/when this is revisited - would still be better long term (particularly if we shift to even larger non-CMake dependencies) but a full shift to the superbuild pattern would be very disruptive to all the custom magic we've put in for our main CMake build.  Worth doing, but will be a significant chunk of time to do right.
