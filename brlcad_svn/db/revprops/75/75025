quell the failure of the 32 bit build with Visual Studio 2019
the failure was caused by a different setting of __STDC__ during configuration and build: during the CMake configuration runs __STDC__ was not set, but via common.h->config_win.h in the build
unfortunately, __STDC__ influenses the presence of off_t (for example)
as it turned out, the __STDC__ define is not necessary any more for Visual Studio 2019 builds (both 32 and 64 bit)
may nedd to be tested with Visual Studio 2017 ...
END
