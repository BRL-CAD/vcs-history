fix a bug reported by russell where bw-png was writing out corrupt pngs with extra carriage returns embedded.  this is due to the utility, like many others, not setting binary-mode (O_BINARY) explicitly before writing binary to stdout.  needs comprehensive audit as, at glance, there are dozens of other utilities that still don't (and are thus broken on Windows).
