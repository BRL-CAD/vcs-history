Checkpoint an experiment with Tk_PhotoImage - after studying the C api and some discussions with the tcl IRC channel, it should be possible to leverage Tk_Photo for image data display from C.  This program generates patterns of data in an image and uses Tk_PhotoPutBlock to both update the image data itself and let Tk know it needs to redraw.  In theory this should be no different than getting RGBA values from a rasterizer or raytracer.  Not doing any event handling yet, however.
