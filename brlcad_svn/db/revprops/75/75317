With the deliberate exceptions of Tcl/Tk and openNURBS, don't install the headers of the src/other libs.  Our bundled versions aren't really intended to (and can't always successfully) substitute for 3rd party libs in other codes as well as our own, and putting our versions of those headers where they can be found invites trouble.  openNURBS we modify for our uses (a system version, which doesn't usually exist anyway, won't work).
