Interesting.  On modern Ubuntu, the packages do install the headers necessary to build itcl/itk3 but they do it in a subdirectory.  Don't know yet if this is a new standard practice for Tcl/Tk 8.6 packaging, but would be nice if it is - set up the logic to check.  This actually lets us build our Tcl/Tk packages against a system install with the src/other/tcl and src/other/tk directories being completely removed when those headers are present, and should also be a better bet for compiling compatibly with the system libs (our local copy may not match the system version - there's certainly no guarantee.)
