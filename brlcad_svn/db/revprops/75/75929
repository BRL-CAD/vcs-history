Ah, cute - the lib*-obj targets weren't getting the visibility flag, so the objects were built vanilla and the lib linking didn't catch this.  Go ahead and add the new definitions for the libs where we've added the necessary logic for MSVC ourselves, since that's one of the things we want to check when building.  Will get tricker when we get to upstream libs where we might actually build against a system lib that does have the __declspec(dllexport) style definitions defined on its own, since our redefinition approach won't be in place there.
