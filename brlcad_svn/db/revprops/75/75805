Add a new regress-repository test to check that all of our files with a main() in them call bu_setprogname.  It may not matter if none of the path aware functions are called, but it won't do any harm and the subsequent consequences (weird/nonintuitive/spotty breakage) when later adding something that needed it justify a blanket 'always call it' rule.
