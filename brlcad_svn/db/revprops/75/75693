Not sure how useful this is really, but it does produce individual BoTs for each plate mode BoT face and a region unioning them all together.  Doesn't respect the various plate mode settings, and the averaging of the normals at vertices has some definite drawbacks, but in at least some cases it will avoid visual cracks.  Too much thickness with the plate mode compared to a face's area and the 'inner' extruded face will twist/invert - need to come up with a check for that.
