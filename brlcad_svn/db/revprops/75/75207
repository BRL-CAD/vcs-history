Look at the variables provided by FindTCL.cmake in CMake itself and shift to them - the complexity of the FindBRLCADTCL.cmake approach has proven to be largely not worthwhile, and the new find_package -D<pkg>_ROOT searching behavior in post 3.12 should provide a simple way to point at a specific Tcl/Tk installation for those that want/need the flexibility.
