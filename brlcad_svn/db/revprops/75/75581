FindTCL.cmake in the main CMake distribution is generating warnings at configure time and doesn't require enough for us - it will accept a libtcl86.so without any headers or tclsh as a FOUND Tcl, which doesn't work.  Grab the relvant three Find* modules and assemble them into something which is hopefully closer to what we need, sticking as close as we can to the vanilla upstream names, etc.
