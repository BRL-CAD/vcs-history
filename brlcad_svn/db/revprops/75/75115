Use of termlib is down to just a few users of libtermio.  Fold the basic termlib pieces into libtermio.  Removes the (considerable) complexity inherent in trying to correctly detect all the various system options.  Eventually we'll replace the last remaining pieces of functionality using this API (which still doesn't work on Windows) - in the meantime this maintains the functionality we need.
