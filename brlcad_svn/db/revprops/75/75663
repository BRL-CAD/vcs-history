Start roughing out a rework of the bot command to make it similar to the new form of the brep command.  Still needs a fair bit of testing - in particular the visualization for the bot checking code hasn't been tried, and the openvdb based rework needs to be enabled/tested after moving.  Goal is to bring organization to the bot subcommands and make it cleaner to add new functionality.  Not going to move any of the bot_* commands until the initial setup is complete and tested - right now just sticking to the commands that were already in bot.c
