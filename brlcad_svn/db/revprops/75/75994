Experiment with generator expressions and add_custom_command/add_custom_target.  Generator expressions will work only in COMMAND, so unfortunately we can't implement the most robust approach - i.e. specify the actual file outputs as the OUTPUT and DEPENDS arguments.  Instead, we use a stamp file specific to the command that generates a per-configuration stamp file using the CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR variable to detect if the build target has run for the current configuration.  This has the drawback that the build target will fail to detect the removal of the per-config output and re-run, but it will re-run if the stamp file is removed or (more importantly) if the source file is edited.
