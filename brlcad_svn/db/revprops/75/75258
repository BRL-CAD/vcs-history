Merge tcltk86 branch back into trunk, using Tcl/Tk 8.6.10. Itcl/Itk 3.4 enabled by default for Archer.  Untested on Mac OSX (especially with Aqua) - there's almost certainly build work needed on that platform.  Doing this now to modernize our Tcl/Tk foundation - even if we have to keep Itcl/Itk 3 for a while 8.6 is the mainstream version.
