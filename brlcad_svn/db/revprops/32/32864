fix at least one problem with the revolve normals where nan's were making their way into the norm() calc causing badness.  this protects the division by zeros applying some naive fallback logic that probably needs reviewing/improving but does fix the problem for at least a few orientations.  there are still problems with looking straight up/down the rotation axis.
