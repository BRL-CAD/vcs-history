greatly improved the usability of the benchmark suite by providing additional processing commands including not doing anything by default any more unless the 'run' command is requested.  added detailed usage and instruction commands along with updated manual page to match.  the options that control how the benchmark behaves can now also be specified on the left or right side of the 'benchmark' command as well on the command-line.
