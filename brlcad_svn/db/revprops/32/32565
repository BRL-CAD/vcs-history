Removed ged_result_flags from struct ged and added another return type (i.e. BRLCAD_HELP). This should make libged easier to use. Before, you would have checked the return value and the result_flags to determine if the function was returning a help message or results of the function call. Now you check only the return value. BTW, the reason an application may need to distinguish the difference between BRLCAD_OK and BRLCAD_HELP may be to refresh a display if the return value is BRLCAD_OK. If it's BRLCAD_HELP, the application would simply show the user the help message.
