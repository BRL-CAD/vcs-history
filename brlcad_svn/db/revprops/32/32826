john fixed a bug in the bspline/nurbs surface where plot would fail.  the problem as he tracked it down was that the Oslo calculation was failing because the refinement knot vector was smaller than the original knot vector.  this was a condition not being tested for, causing a crash.  now it correctly halts refinement.
