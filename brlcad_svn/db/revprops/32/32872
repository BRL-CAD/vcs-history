now there's progress on bombardier worth making some noise about.  it's now fully functioning for displaying files, tested under both x11 and aquatk, and working great.  a lot of love, care, and tenderness went into making the tk layout behave properly so that the sucker actually resizes with a proper mins and desired expansion proportions.  also included are some default key bindings for copy/pasting (though more love is needed to make select all happen).  the next step is to get it sending in the reports somewhere and then hooking it in to run.
