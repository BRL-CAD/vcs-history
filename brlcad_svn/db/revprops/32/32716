Initial framework for docbook based building and installation of man pages.  Currently builds both html and man page; for the moment it installs the html version in the data directory, subdirectory html/man1  Only two test files are present at the moment, and their original man page ancestors are not yet removed - this will come once testing of new arrangement is complete.
