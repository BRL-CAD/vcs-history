Beginnings of work on the new find command - intention is to have (insofar as it makes sense) the full power of the standard Unix style find command available in BRL-CAD.  Eventually this will replace the existing find.c file, but as it is nowhere near ready for primetime keep it elsewhere for now.  DO NOT ADD to makefiles.  At this stage the effort is to get very basic functionality working, then build from there.  If substituted in correctly this version can see objects in the database but is not intelligent about printing paths that identify different instances of the objects - much better print logic will be needed and it may require some BRL-CAD specific additions to the PLAN structure to allow carrying path strings down the db_functree call.  The '*' wildcard must be escaped with '\' or it will cause a crash - this should be fixed with better sanity checking.  The TCL shell is probably expanding the wildcard before processing - can this be avoided for this command?  The upshot is no significant functionality yet, but indications are promising.
