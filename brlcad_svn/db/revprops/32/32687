bob finished implementing a preliminary bot-stl exporter that dumps out bots as stl data but without evaluating the csg booleans, solidity, normals, etc.  this is to help make export go much faster when the modeler doesn't care about the geometric representation.  this is *really* exceptionally bad for analysis purposes unless you know exactly what you're doing and the implications; it's fine for rendering/visualization purposes though.  this addresses sf bug 2106032 from lee butler (g-stl takes too long)
