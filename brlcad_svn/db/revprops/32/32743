with bob's help, we fixed several issues with mged's hacked gets wrapper.  this is in response to lee's sf bug 2123488 ( Tcl I/O broken on Windows and Leopard ) where running mged in tcl gui mode resulted in gets always returning the string length instead of the input string read (with stdin input).  there were then also a couple related bugs for when the channel == stdin that required similar fixage.
