[playing taps] yes, the time has finally come.. to deprecate jove.  it's become a maintenance burden with a bug that actually corrupts (large) input files so it's time to encourage/require users to finally use a different editor, or at least let them know that we're not maintaining it any more.  i've included a jove.emacs sample '.emacs' file that (supposedly, untested) provides jove bindings within emacs that should help folks migrate.  old habits die hard, but that's a habit that should have died more than a decade ago now.  its removal should be expected sometime in late CY 2008 or early CY 2009.
