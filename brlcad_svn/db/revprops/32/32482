make GED_USE_RUN_RT go away.  bio.h is a private header and is not installed so it can't be used in ged.h (which is a public header that is installed).  the ged.h header simply needs to declare and include the headers it uses like any other interface which includes the ged_run_rt struct if it's a public struct (and does seem out of place).  remove all the associated conditionals that relate to GED_USE_RUN_RT while we're at it.
