Removing \todo which is not applicable anymore.  Rotations were not accumulated, instead they depended on the initial point of the screen where the mouse was at the moment of starting, so it caused an strange jump just when starting to drag the mouse around.  There might be other glitches, of course, but the behaviour described here is not present anymore so I remove this \todo.
