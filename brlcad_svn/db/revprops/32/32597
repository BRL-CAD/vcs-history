mged no longer requires that the PATH be set in order to run various commands that get externally invoked under the hood (e.g. fbclear).  this has come up before, but was reminded by a forum post from Murray Blakeman (mblakeman).  The fix is to simply call bu_brlcad_root with the bin/command so that it does the proper lookup.
