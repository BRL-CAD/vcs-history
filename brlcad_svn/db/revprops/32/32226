starseeker pinned down an insideous little crash where bu_vls_strcmp() was crashing if the bu_vls was empty.  this was due to a bug in the bu call where it wasn't accounting for how bu_vls represents emptry strings (they're null strings with no allocation at first).  this makes sure they are at least a valid (empty) string when someone asks for a comparison.  also clean up and document the magic constants.
