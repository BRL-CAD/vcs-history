Making sure ged_log and ged_result_string will initially contain an empty string instead of a null pointer (I wrongly assumed that bu_vls_init did this :-( ). This way, any callers of libged functions can harvest ged_log or ged_result_str without the need to check whether or not it contains a null pointer (i.e. it should always contain atleast an empty string assuming the application doesn't free the vls).
