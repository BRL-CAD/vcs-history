reword -- made all platform installers use consistent naming conventions, outlined in the HACKING file.  In particular, the Windows installer is now more version-aware, installing into a versioned subdir by default (similar to how we distribute for other platforms) and allowing per-version uninstalls. bob also fixed my windows hackage, so props to the man.
