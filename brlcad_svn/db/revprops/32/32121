Grab the renaming of bu_structparse_get_terse_form, etc. in bu.h from r31595 - have this in libbu via one of the updates.  If it doesn't harm anything else it's a logical renaming based on the use of Tcl_Interp in the functions, otherwise need to revert both this and the corresponding libbu changes.
