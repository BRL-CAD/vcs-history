Fix icon and redirected invocation after much pain and suffering.
This 'should' properly refix sf bug 2019280 (mged incorrectly deduces
interactivity).

Wasn't able to find out exactly why select() is returning exceptfds
set.  There is no MSG_OOB pending afaikt and recv() reports it as not
a valid socket making it difficult to distinguish between a here doc
and iconic invocation.  Instead, utilize poll() which does at least
distinguish between those two since icon invocation reports input as
invalid (POLLNVAL) with poll().

This should fix the regression suite, add debugging hooks for future
testing, and make the various interaction/invocation methods work.
This also pushes out the 'interactive' global from pr_prompt.
