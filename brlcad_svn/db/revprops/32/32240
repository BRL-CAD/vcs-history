Crowd wave time!  Bring the new INTAVAL converter (tgf-g) into the default fold for compilation/installation since the legalities and copyright issues have been sorted out.  need to update our docs to reflect the granted  rights (i.e. that they are in no way giving up any rights on their ability to hold copyright or make changes to the code on their end) but since it conforms, we can add it to the default compile now.  excellentness.
