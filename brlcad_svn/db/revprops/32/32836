enable compilation of the former 'hideline' functionality and f_hideline callback for an 'H' command.  it's not clear to me just quite yet what exactly this even does as it's untested, but it is at least no longer 'dead' code.  cursory review seems to be that it's shooting rays for all vlist segments producing some sort of plot file as a result.
