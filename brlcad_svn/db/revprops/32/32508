add support to get_regions to ignore duplicate regions in the hierarchy so that get_regions only lists all regions once.  this makes it so that reid will similarly only set the regionID on a region once instead of incrementing it multiple times (if it was, say, subtracted at an assembly level as well as used elsewhere as a positive region).  this fixes an unexpected behavior reported by dwayne et al.  also made get_regions work on single regions where the only object specified to reid is a region.
