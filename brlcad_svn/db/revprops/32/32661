bob improved the Pro/E exporter so that it now iterates over different tolerance settings, adaptively refining the tessellation tolerance to a more refined mesh if a coarser tolerance fails.  allows controlling the chord length and angle.  he also added more control over logging allowing only outputting success, failures, success+failures, or all debug output.
