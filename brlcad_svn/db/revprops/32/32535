Addressed bug 1918098 reported by David Loman identifying conflicting reports about object type when the region attribute was set with the attr command - code in BRL-CAD using the dp->d_flags mechanism to identify type without being aware of the region attribute would report the object as a combination.  attr now sets the proper flags when the region attribute is either added or removed.
