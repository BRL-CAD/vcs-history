add an icon to bombardier in old-school bitmap format (since that's what tcl wants).  it's nice when all the old tools still work.  bitmap was custom hand-edited based off a picture of real Bombardier wings, dithered to bitmap, exported as png, converted to bw, rotated/inverted to 4th quadrant with bwrot, converted to ascii via bw-a, and then to X11 bitmap format using atobmp.  so nice when everything works.
