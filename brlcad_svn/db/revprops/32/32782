debian build failures still seem to rear their head in src/adrt due to linkage failures on libbu.  add BU as a LIBADD dependency.  more than likely, this is related to link_all_deplibs in libtool but unable to test the configuration from sf bug report 2131397 (Latest svn revision failed to build on Debian sid)
