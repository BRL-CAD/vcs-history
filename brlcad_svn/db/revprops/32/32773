these files are missing the standard copyright header for all contributions.  per the original brl-cad license agreement, all rights of use were granted to the gov't when the code was provided so the sources are covered like everything else in the package.  (copyright was claimed and subsequently granted/assigned to the gov't after a massive change to the collective work).  this inconsistency tweak is in response to the sf.net bug posting 2128053 (Copyright issue) by Giuseppe Iuculano - derevko who is working on Debian integration.
