Adding new search command based off of OpenBSD's find - uses combination of !, -o and () to form complex logical search structures.  Currently implemented options include -name, -attr, -stdattr, and -type.  -attr has the ability to search for either attributes or attribute,value pairs - e.g. -attr region_id vs. -attr region_id=100.  stdattr will return a match if an object uses only standard attributes and uses more than one such attribute. name is the objects base name (not its full path) and like all of the options allows shell style pattern matching:  -name object\*.s.  -type matches according to primitive type for primitives and combination/region matching for non-primitives.
