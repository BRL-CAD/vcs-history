simplify the compilation/configuration options for generating the documentation.  provide just one configure option that turns the docs all on or all off for now, support 'auto' by default so it's on if it finds what it needs, and simplify the makefile logic as well.  push the logic up into the docbook dir so we don't even traverse if it's off.  this lets you manually traverse into the dir to create the docs even if they were configured off.  this is all fairly untested but should be close.  this should fix the latest follow-up issue reported in sf bug report 2131397 (Latest svn revision failed to build on Debian sid)
