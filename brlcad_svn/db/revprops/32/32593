absorb the old mged 'edcolor' command into the 'color' command as a -e option.  this reduces the entropy by removing a lot of duplication shared between the two commands.  they still could use some refactoring to make _ged_edcolor go away, but it's a start.  this ALSO makes it so there is no mged command that doesn't have non-blocking behavior when run without arguments (edcolor blocks until editor terminates).  there are still some edcolor hooks that need to be removed as libged is completed and mged is updated.
