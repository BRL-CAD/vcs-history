john awesomely added tessellation support to the DSP primitive.  the fact that dsp's lacked tess support was brought to attention on the brlcad-devel mailing list by Bengt Wennehorst who discovered g-stl failing on a dsp.  naturally, adding tess support to the dsp primitive makes it possible to export them through any of the polygonal exporters.
