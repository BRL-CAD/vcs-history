deprecate the use of %S as a struct bu_vls format specifier, now using %V instead.  update all instances from the old to the new and document the functions that parsed them (structparse and logging).  run-time and regression tested successfully, but there are nasty verbose warnings that should get printed if any were missed.  the reason this change was made was because libc now uses %S for wchar_t strings as an alias for %ls.
