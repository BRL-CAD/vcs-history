significant change to mged's initialization.  instead of using the (flawed) approach of using isatty() to determine if we're interactive, make interactive the default mode and find a reason to not be interactive.  this is done by checking for command-mode args or redirected standard input.  the latter one in particular was tricky given some means to invoke the application might leave the stdin read fd set even though there may be no data.  this was specifically observed on Mac OS X where using the X11 application menu resulted in a MSG_OOB pending exception fd getting set (..seemingly to indicate that stdin should be closed?).

either way, this change should make it possible to have mged invoked without needing a controlling terminal (e.g. as an icon).  this specifically supports sf bug report 2019280 (mged incorrectly deduces interactivity) from lode_leroy where he tried to create a linux mged.desktop icon.
