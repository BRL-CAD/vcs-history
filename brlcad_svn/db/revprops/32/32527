simon clubly on the brlcad-users mailing list reported and isolated a rather nasty bug that was causing an 'Illegal instruction' from rt during ray-tracing.  the cause was pin-pointed down to sse instructions getting executed on non-sse hardware, with gcc generating the code due to the -msse and -msse2 flags regardless of the local system's capacity to run that code (e.g. for cross-compiling).  commenting out those flags for now (as it's not required) and crediting clubly for the fix with special thanks.
