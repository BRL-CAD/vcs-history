stub in initial functionality for supporting points that optionally have per-point color, scale, and normal data while remaining a memory-compact representation using exactly no more than necessary (allowing datasets only limited by the size of available memory).  don't yet implement support for reading in or using the extra data just yet, but the container is there now.  later might also want to add support for allowing binunif as the data source.
