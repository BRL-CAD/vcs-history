Fixed so no current regression tests fail (but no guarantees).
Found some missing flags, precision wasn't handled properly 
  for strings (absolutely constrains string length [but not field 
  width]).
Added new bit flags for special format cases, added FIXMEs where
  more looks are needed (more tests need to be added).
Added bit flag categories of modifiers and category bit-clearing
  flags
Added comments to help trace the control flow.
Added curly braces to help decode and clarify if/else paths.
Added provision for "expected fail" cases (none at the moment).
Tests need to be added to handle more cases.
Review and critique solicited.
