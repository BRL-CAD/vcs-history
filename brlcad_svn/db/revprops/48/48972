Make each type of DocBook output depend on the XSL stylesheet used to generate that type of output, so it gets automatically regenerated if the stylesheets are changed.  Note that we don't depend on the .xsl.in file but the generated .xsl file in the build directory - this is OK because the .xsl.in files are tracked by CMake, and CMake will be re-run if they change.  If the xsl.in file is different, it will change the generated .xsl file and trigger the build rule.
