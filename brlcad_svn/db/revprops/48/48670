looks like there are a few more SIGN_EXTENSION defects being reported by coverity.  same problem, where we were loosing range on buffer values greater than 0x7FFFFFFF (which probably would have led to instability on crazy-large structures (approaching 32-bit limit).  unlikely an issue, but real bug nonetheless.
