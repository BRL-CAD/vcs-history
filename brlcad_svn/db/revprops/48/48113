magic number checking overhaul.  remove most of the interior loop and interior logic magic number checking.  it's important to perform magic number checks as part of input validation (akin to assert()) but need not be part of ongoing calculations.  checking inputs insures that we'll at least narrow in on memory corruption to a function scope, which is usually good enough.  technically, this may introduce a logic change if there is some nasty code relying on a bu_bomb() hook getting called, but that would be bad anyways.
