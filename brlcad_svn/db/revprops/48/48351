fix a TOCTOU time-of-check, time-of-use race condition reported by coverity now that we can capture a fild descriptor from bu_file_exists().  with that, now all of the stat calls will act on the same file.  might still call remove() on a different path, but there's no way to unlink a file descriptor.
