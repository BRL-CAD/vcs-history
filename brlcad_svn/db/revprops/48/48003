conversion from bu_vls_init() to BU_VLS_INIT_ZERO initialization.  this performance tune avoids a function call and memory allocation if the string is never used but, more importantly, simplifies the code and makes it less error-prone in the situations where we only conditionally initialized or initialized much later in the logic.  this commit covers approximately 45% of the bu_vls_init() calls.  woot: +366 -718.
