Reported a bug to AStyle dev with k&r formatting of functions using return types with spaces (i.e. a function returning 'void' will format correctly, but one returning 'struct bn_table *' won't) but otherwise results are looking fairly good - still only tested a few files though, may be more bugs lurking.
