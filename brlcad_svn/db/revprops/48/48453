refactor bu_list_path() and bu_count_path() into a new bu_dir_list() function that performs both.  returns the count now and optionally takes a pattern (instead of a suffix) and conditionally handles all of the memory allocation for the caller automatically.  fixed a memory leak and off-by-one bug.  documented the new function and one caller in nirt accordingly.  initiated in response to RESOURCE_LEAK reported by coverity (cov cid 478).
