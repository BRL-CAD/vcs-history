Rework handling of 3rd party resources in doc/docbook - teach CMake to de-compress archives of the files in question, instead of checking in the full (verbose) xsl files and uncompressed fonts.  On-disk size of doc/docbook/resources shrinks from 43 Megs to 17 - i.e. 26 Megs less to download per BRL-CAD svn checkout.  File count in doc/docbook/resources goes from 1604 to 47.
