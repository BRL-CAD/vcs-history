And now, the final piece of the configuration options documentation.  Automatically update the INSTALL file (currently pulling INSTALL.cmake, but that will change later) with changes in BRL-CAD options and aliases.  In keeping with the principle of not touching the source directory the original INSTALL file is not altered - instead, a new file is generated (INSTALL.new) and a warning is printed at the end of the configure process notifying the developer of the changed file.  It is then up to the develper to review the new INSTALL.new and copy it manually into the source tree.  The major benefit of this method is the autogeneration of the alias lists - the same lists used by the logic actually defining the aliases in CMake are also used to generate the docs.
