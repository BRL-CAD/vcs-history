Do a little rework on the lemon target macro - saw an error: Error renaming from 'expparse.c' to 'expparse.c': No such file or directory - this might happen if lemon does something wrong, but it could also mean lemon isn't done and the copy command tries to proceed anyway, so split out the steps to make intermediate file dependencies explicit - may help.
