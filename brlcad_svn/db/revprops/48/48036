Swap in the new Tcl macro system.  Needs debugging, but this will hopefully be a more organized framework within which to find the bugs.  Also added one additional feature to the summary - if a component is disabled that is to be reported in the summary, and a system version was NOT found, put an exclamation point after the OFF to indicate potential trouble.
