Tweak the astyle opt file - for the moment, remove align-pointer since it's changing some stuff in if conditionals (for example, avs.c line 45) that look like maybe they shouldn't be changed.  Sean fixed astyle, so turn on kr styling.  The pad-oper setting appears to work as advertised, the question is whether we want to apply it globally...
