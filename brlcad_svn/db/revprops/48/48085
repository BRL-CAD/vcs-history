add a new bu_str_unescape() function for removing backslash characters from strings.  simpler to implement since the output is always less than or equal in size to the input.  otherwise,similar to bu_str_escape() in that it supports static and dynamic memory models as well as overlapping or same input/output buffers and should be threadsafe and re-entrant as long as the inputs are.  make sure we null-terminate.
