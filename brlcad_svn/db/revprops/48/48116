Add a (commented out, for now) additional test for rtweight that feeds it a more... quirky density file.  As rtweight's parsing of density files is currently set up, this will infinite loop (and fill up your hard drive) but after rtweight is improved enable this test (will need to replace the current 'results text' for weight2 with the correct output.
