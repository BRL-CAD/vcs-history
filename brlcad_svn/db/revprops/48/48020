Extend the NOSYS mechanism to tools as well.  Perplex is our own tool, so even a SYSTEM install isn't going to have it available (it's our own code, just being treated as a separate project) and trying to use a system version of lemon is... problematic, to say the very least.  lempar.c isn't likely to be present, and even when our copy is placed in /usr/bin problems occurred.  lemon isn't packaged by itself, so it's hard to know what to do about that... suggest upgrading sqlite?  probably better to use our local copy for now...
