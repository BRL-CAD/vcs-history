we're setting the 32-bit or'd buffer value into a size_t so have to be careful about implicit sign extension going from unsigned char to int for the shift to size_t (unsigned).  cast to size_t before the shift to keep it unsigned.  detected by coverity SIGN_EXTENSION check (cid 1259,1260,1261,1262).
