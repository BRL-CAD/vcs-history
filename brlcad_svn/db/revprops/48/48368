This one's a bit more interesting.  Coverity doesn't think the tol->dist comparison with the -1 settings of dist1 and dist2 is enough to guanantee a continue in the bad case, and if that's so then next_fus->vp being check for NULL earlier and then being used may imply a problem.  I doubt we're getting negative tolerances, but since the tol type is double it's not forbidden.  Rather than depend on the -1 comparison, set a control variable that will trigger a continue and then set that to 1 instead of setting dist1/2 to -1 - then it won't matter what the tol value is.
