Do more work to make BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS=System do what it claims to do.  Also make Tcl packages respect it, unless BRLCAD_TCL is overridden locally - then respect the local Tcl setting rather than BUNDLED_LIBS.  Still needs some testing - not a terribly useful setting for us, but the Linux distributions will probably want it so we should shake it out and make it behave.
