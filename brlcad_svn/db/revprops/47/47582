it was an interesting idea, but not a great one.  did a quick test to see how much time might be gained if we skipped the initial vls allocation.  looked to be about 25% for bu_vls_printf() which is marginally interesting at best.  probably not worth the complexity and long-term maintenance (error-prone), at least for now.
