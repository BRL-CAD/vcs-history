Normals already encountered, were not being added to the list of normals, fixed that. There are situations where summing the normals in the overlapping surface alone will not give the exact direction from which a body is hitting another body. But simply using the velocity also does not work for all cases to find this direction. Somewhere these 2 ways need to be merged or chosen from , based upon criteria.
