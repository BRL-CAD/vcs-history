add support for carriage returns in addition to newlines since nirt is doing it's own parsing thing.  untested, but should just make windows-style text files act like they have double newlines (and should make ancient mac-style text files not look like a long single line).  prompted by sf support request #3426854 from Fred W (NIRT scriptfile) where he assumedly ran into this issue.
