make a minimally impacting change to bu_cmd()'s signature swapping the arguments so they are inputs followed by outputs convention.  add a new result parameter so we can distinguish between commands that don't exist and commands that fail.  the return value now indicates existence only while the result parameter will contain the command's return value.  this allows us to fix a few caller instances that needed to distinguish the two.
