avoid the assumption that tol is a bn_tol.  since they all just call the distance tolerance, leave it up to the caller to provide the value so as an API call, it only needs to be a tolerance value instead of a struct.  propagate accordingly throughout nmg.  also leave FIXME notes for three macros that are apparently using >= and <= comparisons with floating point values where the '=' case is not guaranteed to give stable behavior.  the testing interval must be an open interval.
