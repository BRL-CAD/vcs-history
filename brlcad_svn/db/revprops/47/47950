Update to file 'nmg_bool.c' function 'nmg_bool'. Moved the execution of function 'nmg_manifolds' (which creates the manifolds list) from a lower level to 'nmg_bool' so it is only executed once per boolean operation. Previously is was executed for every ray that was shot during the classification of the nmg objects.
