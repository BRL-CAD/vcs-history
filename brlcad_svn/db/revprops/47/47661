Start trying to figure out how to properly shuffle a file back and forth between client and server.  Ideally, want to have the server send the file to the client, have the client reconstitute the file, and then fire the file back at the server, which reconstitutes it in turn and maybe compares it to the original buffer.  Not immediately clear how to achieve this yet.
