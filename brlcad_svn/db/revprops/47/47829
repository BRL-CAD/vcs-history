Coming very close to building xsltproc cross-platform for guaranteed docbook->html documentation generation.  Only known problem is on Windows, and that seems to be primarily related to the new catalog usage with the advanced Docbook formatting (to the best of my knowledge, the new Docbook formatting logic has never been tested on Windows before.)  Setting environment variables in the CMake COMMAND lines didn't go over well on Windows, so have shifted to a new approach - for each docbook target, write a small CMake script that contains all the proper environment variable foo and commands for that target.  Then the custom command, rather than defining and running the command, calls  -P to execute the script file.  That approach *does* seem to do the right thing on Windows, besides having the nifty side effect of making Docbook build debugging simpler by having a fully expanded build command immediately available.  Last step is to figure out what the right voodo is for Windows - the path rewrite logic isn't doing something right with the windows paths, may need to dig into how that's being done and whether there are build flags for Windows path handling in the xml code...
