big restructuring in support of better reporting for whether bundled or sys libs are being used (and why).  few cases weren't being handled and the string STREQUAL testing was causing cmake to report warnings.  simplify string comparisons to substrings where applicable, reduce/reorder logic for clarity, and reword messages for consistency.
