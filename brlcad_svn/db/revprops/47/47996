structparse refactoring to fix a couple long outstanding issues.  structparse tables chained together via %p no longer stash the address in sp_count, instead using sp_offset just like everything else.  update all callers accordingly.  also, update the %V bu_vls handlers to not do their own thing merely because callers weren't initializing their vls before calling a structparse function.  require init and make all callers initialize beforehand (e.g., via BU_VLS_INIT_ZERO)
END
