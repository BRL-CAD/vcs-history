add a new header for wrapping the logic and functionality necessary for protecting against a bug in gcc 4.6.2 where the FD_*() macros aren't marked as extensions causing gcc to emit a warning during -O3 compilation about ISO C forbidding braced-groups within expressions.  this may need some more precautions to ensure we only perform this workaround when absolutely necessary, but it seems to work well for the platform (linux) exhibiting the error.
