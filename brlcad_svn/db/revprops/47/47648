Get the build working again.  Interestingly, the new approach to defines appears to actually have beneficial DRY consequences even beyond MSVC - the display manager definitions needed for libdm had been required in libtclcad and mged as well, but now they automatically inherit libdm's settings.  Which means we can't cheat by defining something for a library and then defining that same flag differently when compiling an app that uses that library, but on the whole an interesting result.
