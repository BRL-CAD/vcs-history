add the tar-ustar option to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE so that we're not limited to paths 99 chars or less.  ustar increases the limit to 256 chars (tar-pax would increase it to unlimited, but requires 1.9).  this effectively drops out-of-the-box build support on Mac OS X 10.4 but it's an old system and autotools is almost out the door so allow the bump in order to get a valid release tarball.
