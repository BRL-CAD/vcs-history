developers already have the prestige badge and will invariably/usually have all contributed to docs in some fashion by the time they get that designation (100+ features), so avoid double-listing any dev.  also, expand docs to include the website so we can credit robert leverginton for his work redesigning the main site back in 2007.  responded to my sf posting in june 2007, unveiled new unified theme drupal+mediawiki+gallery2 site in march 2008.
