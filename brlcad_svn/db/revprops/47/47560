rename BRLCAD-CPU_TYPE and CMAKE_CPU_TYPE to BRLCAD-WORD_SIZE and CMAKE_WORD_SIZE respectively so as not to imply chip type or architecture.  CPU may be multimode as could the compiler, so it's not a good moniker.  also consistently use either ##BIT or ##-bit styles when referring to the size in text.
