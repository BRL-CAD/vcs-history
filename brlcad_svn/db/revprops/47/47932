Don't use the rng schema with xmllint, per advice from the libxml list - fortunately, we can also use a more standard schema.  Also, rather than defining the flags somewhere other than the 'command' file, make it self contained - in prinicple, that should make swapping in a different validator as simple as defining a .cmake.in file for that command and setting a toplevel setting.  Need to experiment a little.
