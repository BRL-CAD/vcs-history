Until the more powerful help browser has been worked out, let's go with a solution that at least avoids printing the error messages - there doesn't seem to be any actual regression in functionality due to *not* reading the css (not too surprising since it wasn't originally there at all) so turn off the full hv3 and quell the warning message in our local hv3 subset.  Should let things proceed until the full-powered system gets sorted out.
