richard made a slew of changes to improve NMG processing which have been enabled, but not yet independently validated so schedule their announcement in the next minor bump.  one specific example is r45358 where he improved the success of boolean ops when there coplanar faces.  this affects mged tessellation commands (facetize, E, ev) as well as most of our exporters.
