Have the THIRD_PARTY_TCL_PACKAGE macro handle the question of what to do when Tk is required and disabled - we're going to want the option defined regardless so we get the documentation, once we turn those features on.  Still need to rework the itcl/itk logic so it doesn't have to double-call the macro.
