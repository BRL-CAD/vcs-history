formally mark all of the muves-specific commands as DEPRECATED, making them report a deprecation warning if they're used.  this includes em, e_muves, l_muves, lm, read_muves, and t_muves.  rationale is that those are domain-specific extensions that don't really belong in brl-cad (they belong with muves).  they would make for a potentially suitable set of plugins to a plugin-oriented libged, but not something we maintain and bundle.
