Slightly alter the pdf options logic, to avoid unexpected behavior.  By default, when enabling PDF building, ALL pdfs are now built.  The PDF_MAN option still appears after PDF is enabled, but it defaults to on rather than off to avoid surprises - avoids the 'why didn't the man page pdfs get built even though I enabled pdf?' question.
