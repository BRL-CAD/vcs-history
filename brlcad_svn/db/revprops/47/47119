enhanced bu_basename(), now with more slashy flavor.  always interprets '/' as a path separator in addition to whatever the native separator is so that we can use libbu for geometry paths as well as filesystem paths.  also added a quick check to make sure drive paths are removed if this is windows so we don't get the drive letter returned as a path.  also started to add code to recognize escaped paths but it turns out that the system basename() (bsd/mac) doesn't support that feature so it was pulled.
