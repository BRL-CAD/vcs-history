similar to bu_basename(), make bu_dirname() also always treat unix-style '/' forward slashes as path separators even on platforms that use a different directory separator (windows).  that will make the function continue to be useful for geometry paths, which are always url/unix-style.  fixed a bug detected during unit testing while at it, collapsing sequences of trailing path separators to just one.
