Add documentation and aliases for Tcl/Tk packages.  Most of the way there (although the documentation blurbs undoubtedly need work) - remaining issues are options that can be completely conditionalized away (termlib, scl) - need to make sure the options are called to generate the doc strings, may need to extend the 'required vars' mechanism in used for Tcl/Tk packages to THIRD_PARTY itself.
