implement more generalized BU_GET() and BU_PUT() macros intended to replace BU_GETSTRUCT(), BU_GETUNION(), and BU_GETTYPE().  these versions should provided added application security by guaranteeing zero-init and sanity cleanup when released/put.  used appropriately, they become convenient places to hook in a pool allocator given the allocations are intrinsically small and defined as dynamic.
