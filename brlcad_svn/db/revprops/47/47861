Rework the docbook logic again, to not use the catalog file - as near as I can tell, it's just using the catalog file to all 'abbreviated' paths in a couple other style files.  Rather than do that, we can just make them .in files and have CMake fill in the paths directly.  Hopefully will put less strain on xsltproc...
