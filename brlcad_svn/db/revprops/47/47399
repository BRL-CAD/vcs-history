Some bug fixes to ray shots, now the normals for rigid body B are summed correctly when there are overlapping objects : rigid body A and rigid body B. Next is shooting a bunch of rays in the direction opposite to this normal, to measure the depth of penetration of B into A and finally calculate the bunch of contact points on the surface of B which lies inside A(due to the penetration). Then we have all the required info to inject into Bullet
