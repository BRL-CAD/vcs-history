Checkpoint some work studying boost::asio + Google's protobuf - probably not a direction we want to go right now, but saving what has been done in case it should prove useful at some point in the future.  Decided not to add the entire CMake-ified boost, just include the one tweak needed.  Same deal for protobuf - see README for the locations to get them from.
