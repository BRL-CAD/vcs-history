assuming the X11 include and lib search paths are in some sort of reverse priority order, sort them to help ensure system dirs take precedence over legacy package system dirs (except for /usr/local).  make sure /usr/X11 comes 'before' (i.e., after due to reverse priority order?) the previous /usr/X11R6 convention.  eliminate trailing ws waste too.
