richard also added new options to the g-vrml exporter.  to quote: Significate updates to the 'g-vrml' converter. Some logic bugs were fixed. Triangulation was changed to use 'nmg_triangulate_model' instead of its own function which was very limited. Added two new options. A '-b' option to perform a bot dump (all csg geometry is ignored) and '-e' to perform an evaluation or all opjects including bots. By default bots are dumped and csg evaluation is perform ignoring the bots. Some code refactoring was also done. More testing is needed but appears to be working well.
