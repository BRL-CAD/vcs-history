Try a cute trick - override the message command to enhance logging. CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log should now have almost all messages from the cmake configure process - possible exceptions are those written out without using the MESSAGE command.  Also make a stab at accepting ON and OFF for the AUTO/BUNDLED/SYSTEM vars
