Well, the downloadable Windows xsltproc isn't succeeding either, and at least some of the failure signature looks similar.  Time to figure out why.  Also, need some fixes to executable calls - quite in docbook logic to allow for spaces in pathnames (there'll probably be a lot more of this needed later on...) Still need to rework the third party exec macro somewhat to allow for manual specification of the executable path.
