basing the number of segments off of a chord length that's 5% of the view width will still create chunkly segments (50px long for a 1024 display) for large circles and sub-pixel chords for small circles (less than 20px).  instead, try basing the size off of the circle's circumference in terms of pixels.  this uses a chord length of 4px so the circles are always relatively smooth regardless of size.  assumes from glancing through the logic that 'r' is actually the diameter (hopefully).
