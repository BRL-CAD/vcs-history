Add toggle to draw only first unioned solid.

Add checkbutton (set the same as -F option on startup) to toggle drawing only
the first union in overlap paths.

Going with a checkbutton in a labelframe for the moment as a compromise between
many considerations and future planned work. A toggle for showing overlap
volume plots can be added as another checkbutton inside the labelframe.
