Remove NUGRID.  Never completed, the "new" gridded spatial
partitioning method remained a hopeful performance boost.  Without a
proponent, it has only remained a source of code complexity and
maintenance cost.  Testing indeed showed NUGRID outperforming the BSP
implementation (NUBSPT), speeding up overall ray tracing 10-35%, but
not consistently and sometimes crashing.
