Add initial check command test script.

Currently runs the check Tcl-command in mged (mged -a nu -c) to check
basic invocation behavior, and also subtraction behavior on two simple
overlap cases.

No args, but finds check.tcl by CHECKER_DIR environment variable.
Doesn't run check.sh. Test databases and overlap directories are written
out by the test script itself.

END
