Restructure/generalize BRLCAD_FUNCTION_EXISTS in preparation for a push to finish the c89 compliance work (so we can bump the standard up in subsequent releases.)  We need to declare some things that are present-but-hidden to be able to use them regardless of c89 vs gnu89 flagging.  This rewrite should position us to be able to do those tests more cleanly and easily.  Need close study to make sure the testing is being done 'right' but we've needed that anyway for quite a while.
