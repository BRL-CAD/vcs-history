overhaul the change policy write-up to be more clear and consistent.  now characterizes all changes as either minimally impacting or not, grouping new and broken interface changes as minimally impacting.  no change to the rules other than the inclusion of broken (which was implicit via bug fix practice).  removed a lot of duplicate language and emphasized the main sections better.
