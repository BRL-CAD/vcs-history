Added code to clear a few bindings in forward_key_bindings. These weren't getting forwarded to the command window in key-forwarding-mode. Added catch statements around the bindings for sed_apply and sed_reset. This eliminates the unnecessary barking when accidentally typing P or S in the geometry window when not in an edit mode.
