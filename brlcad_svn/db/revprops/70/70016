Switch from using LOCATION property to $<TARGET_ style expressions.  This probably means we now require CMake 3+, but the newest CMake versions are starting to complain about use of LOCATION and even Debian old-stable has moved to 3.0.2.  Rather than complicate the logic by trying to support both styles, just go with the "new" approach.  So far tested only in isolated libpng builds, so it needs testing with the integrated BRL-CAD build.
