add some logic to detect whether sse/avx/simd support is available.  credit pytorch folks where found, though unconfirmed that they are the original authors.  modified to not perform tests simply by finding the package.  currently used by gdal build logic, should be extended to cad. improvement over existing sse cmake detection logic.
