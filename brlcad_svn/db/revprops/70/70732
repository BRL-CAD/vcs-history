fix a couple issues in the std_hdr_defs function.  if a HAVE_ test failed (i.e., was unset), it was still defining it (and setting to an empty string).  empty -DHAVE_..="" strings then didn't play well with the #if tests which should have been #ifdef tests.  lastly, made a change to only calculate the cppflags once since it doesn't need to recheck the template again afterevery symbol.
