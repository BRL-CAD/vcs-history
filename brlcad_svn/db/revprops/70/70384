prevent an infinite loop in rt_find_backing_dist() when fed a ray with a zero direction vector.  this bug only affected piece entities (i.e., bots) and rays fired from within them, but was encountered in the wild from an external calling code.  fix here uses a fairly minimal test to determine we're looping unproductively.  intentionally do not calculate the vector's magnitude as doing so would be considerably more costly.  better would be to catch this in rt_shootray() which already does have a test for this, but the test was disabled for performance.
