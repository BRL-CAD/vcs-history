Attempts to fast-import stream svn commits on top of the cvs->git conversion using svn2git or git-svn-fast-import haven't worked very well so far... probably still possible in theory but not sure how far I'd end up having to dig.  For now start doing some experiments on the 'manual replay' scenario to see if that would be simpler to figure out - slow and working is fine for this, as long as it works...
