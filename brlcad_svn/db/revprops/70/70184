Checkpoint initial work on getting a subset of gdal building with CMake.  Stripped out any format requiring a non-bundled library to build (and a few where it looks like someone didn't notice an external lib was needed) other than zlib and libpng (which we guarantee anyway).  This is nowhere near correct yet - still in the process of figuring out how all this is supposed to go together, and which tests we still need for the 'minimal' subset of GDAL, but it does at least build on Linux so a useful time to checkpoint.  MSVC isn't even on the horizon yet, but have observed at least a few things that are likely to be issues.  Hopefully we can consult with the makefile.vc files for how to handle them...
