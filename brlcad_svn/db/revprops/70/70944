Fix rint definition for Visual Studio 11 2012.

An error in the common.h test was causing rint to get redefined there.
Fix the common.h test and, on Windows, have it define rint/lrint
macros for C++ sources as well as C sources so we don't need a
separate rint definition in config_win.h in the first place.

Also remove redundant extern declarations for rint from several
sources.
