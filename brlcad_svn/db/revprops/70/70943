there's limited benefit to enqueuing more than one task at a time.  it makes for an inefficient render tail as the image comes to completion with some nodes done and others still with 3 assignments being worked (and the server isn't smart enough to send those out to idle nodes).  doing one at a time will ensure the work remains spread out until the very end.
