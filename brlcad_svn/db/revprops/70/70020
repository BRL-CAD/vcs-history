Bump to 3.0.2 across the board, remove older policy logic.  Looks like the only remaining dependency on any OLD policy setting is a test in Tcl that needs 0053 set to old (quoting rules).  This sets the stage for doing some experiments with the new TARGET build-time evaluation expressions, which may (not sure yet) have the potential to simplify some of the build logic.
