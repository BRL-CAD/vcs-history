First output of shot data from a hit with inirt.  Very likely problems with bits of the reporting (especially overlaps) to resolve, but progress.  Also, stdout and stderr now call their hooks immediately, rather than at the end of an exec cycle, so ordering takes care of itself if everything is being dumped to the terminal immediately by the calling application (e.g. individual errors will be interleaved with output, rather than being grouped at the end.  Probably don't need to do this for other output types, but for stdout and stderr it may matter.
