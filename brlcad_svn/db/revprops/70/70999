The use of the ON_Brep type in mk_brep is breaking lto building.  It looks like both the C and C++ versions of the definition (we have a C stub in brep/defines.h) are getting called where lto can see it simultaneously, and lto can't sort out the situation since those two versions of the function signature are in fact different when ON_Brep is different.  Try a void casting to hide the C++ type from explicit exposure - this may be technically minimally impacting if we can come up with a sufficiently smart regex...
