install scripts with execute permission.  configure_file can't do it by itself, so stage through to a file(COPY) where we can set permissions (using 755). there's some undiagnosed way for the script to get copied without source permissions, thus screwing with things needing them to have execute (e.g., benchmark calling elapsed.sh).
