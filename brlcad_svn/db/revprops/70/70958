bail immediately if we have a .rej file, so we can see what went wrong.  Unfortunately, it looks like svn diff may be changing line endings to suit the platform, which is apparently not what cvs was doing - one of the failures is on the misc/nsis/copying.txt example copyright line, which is apparently using dos line endings in the cvs to git conversion.  Does this mean we need to do some sort of more fundamental API communication with libsvn and friends after all?
