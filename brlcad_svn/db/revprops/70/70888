Technically, this may be user visible.  Previous NIRT behavior when reading in double floating point numbers used an internal routine that sometimes resulted in an accumulated error (observed in some quick testing to be on the order of 1e-10).  While this was insignificant in 'most' use cases, when trying to reproduce an exact ray it could be an issue.  Switched to using the standard C library function strtod for string to double conversion, which does a better job.
