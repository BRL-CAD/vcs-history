pthread headers on some bsd still haven't been scrubbed for c90/posix.1 compliance.  we hack around the header type by giving it another similar c90 type which should be good enough.  also forcibly adding the -pthread flag to help find_package(Threads) actually do a better job (even though that's supposedly something it tests for, it was failing because of unspecified linkage)
