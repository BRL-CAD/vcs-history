hardcoded path assumptions finally came back around to bite.  let this be managed externally to cmake via MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.  if it needs to be set inside cmake, there's CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET that can be set too.  now we just warn if we're making a release build without specifying anything.
