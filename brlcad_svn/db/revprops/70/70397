Make mged screengrab command work on Windows. Just a matter of copying the ogl implementation of the dm_getDisplayImage callback to wgl and setting the corresponding dm_wgl function pointer. The ogl implementation seems to have been written to work for both ogl and wgl from day one. What possibly happened was that since all the dm specific callbacks are private functions, there was no way to register the ogl function in the wgl callback table, so the wgl callback was just left null pending some refactoring that never ended up happening.
