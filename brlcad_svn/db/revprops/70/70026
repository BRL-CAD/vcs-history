Start preparing the ground work for a distcheck introspection that is based entirely on files - no specification of directories.  This will be both to simplify the logic and to increase robustness for the non-svn distcheck case - if we have all files listed explicitly, svn is not strictly needed to do a full source repo verification.  For the moment this will break distcheck, but need to checkpoint before the next stage.
