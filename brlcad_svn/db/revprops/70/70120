slew of changes in support of link-time optimization.  uninitialized data access, dead code, aliasing due to incorrect types, and a big reworking of the rtuif applications.  they should now be back to defining the right modes (RTSRV and RT_MULTISPECTRAL) and linking the right objects in rttherm, remrt/rtsrv, and all the other rt apps.
