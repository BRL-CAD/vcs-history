vasco noticed that TrueRg aka trueregp is not actually used for anything.  looking through the history, it looks like this goes WAY back circa 1989 rt v2 era probably intended to provide the caller with additional region info for xor and overlapping cases, but never actually used or completed.  this eliminates six branch conditions from the boolean evaluation path.  no impact on benchmark.
