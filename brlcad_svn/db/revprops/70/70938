blindly dishing out work in npsw sizes isn't always effective, especially when number of pixels is near npsw.  especially when pixels are extremely expensive, we can end up with very few (1-3) threads working on their last chunk and all other threads idle.  here we dish out work based on the size of the job and the number of available resources so that most cores should remain active through to the end.  we also let the chunking go far greater than before which should help a smidgen with performance.
