wow, a lot more insideous debugging required to find a workaround for compiling c99 on Mac.  turns out their system header logic drops the inline keyword (while still defining all the ctype functions) resulting in tons of duplicate symbols at link time.  fix is to either not support c99 or this hack: define inline inline.  the logic leaves it alone and we get proper inlining.
