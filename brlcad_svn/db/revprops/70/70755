Start working on a man page specific to NIRT's formatting functionality.  This is borderline between a file format and command documentation... we are essentially using it as a file format by defining pre-packaged NIRT formatting files.  Also, the topic is sufficiently complex/verbose that it warrants its own discussion and examples rather than hiding it in a bigger NIRT man page.
