Implement Sean's idea to use declarations when functions are present but undefined to allow us to turn off the GNU C compiler extension for C89 but still use system features that are actually present.  This represents a sort of 'hybrid' C89 compliance, as a compromise between true C89 compliance (re-implementing or not using any functionality not in C89) and minimizing reliance on the more permissing GNU extensions.  Tested with 2 GCC versions on Linux currently, so needs more testing on other platforms.  Once we're done shaking it down, this should set the stage for planting the flag on the next release as the last C89 version of the code and allow us to increase our use of more modern standards going forward.
