fix a couple bugs in the loadview command.  first, the filename check was always failing because of quotes around the db name that were added to support spaces.  they now get stripped.  also fixed a memory error where the bu_argv_from_string functino was writing past the end of the array we passed it by one pointer.  crash fixed.
