Set useair for rtip_air, tweak units printing.  Remaining differences with original regression test NIRT output seem to be correct gap reporting (apparently that was broken when the nirt 'regression' test file was assembled?? - urk\!) and differences in the text related to reporting of attributes, having to do with standardization and prep ordering.
