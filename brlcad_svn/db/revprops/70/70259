Add a generic uniqueness test callback to bu_vls_incr.  The db_lookup specific version of the get_name function doesn't look worthwhile on closer examination, since it appears to be common to build a mapping of names before beginning the process of writing out copies of objects (in particular, combs need to know what new name to refer to).
