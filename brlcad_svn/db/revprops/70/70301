expand out more comprehensive support for toggling profile guided optimization on/off.  repurposed and renamed the old -pg profiling option which isn't at useful anymore, now using BRLCAD_PGO_PATH.  if you set it and the path doesn't exist, profiling is generated.  if you set it at the path does exist, profiling is used during optimization.
