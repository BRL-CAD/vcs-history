gcv tries to support an Imagemagick '{format}:' prefix syntax for specifying file type, but Windows makes this problematic with its {drive letter}: style of path.  Because of this path style being a valid path specifier, we can't support single letter format prefixes without introducing ambiguity.  Ironically, the only CAD mime type with a single letter mapping we have defined currently (i.e. the only specification this might actually break) is the .g file.  So, as an alternative, we add an a 'brlcad' specifier to the mime_cad.types file to provide a workable option for explicit .g format prefix specification.
