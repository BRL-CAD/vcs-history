FindPROJ4 already sets PROJ4_INCLUDE_DIR so just use it -- needed when system PROJ4 is found (and it's an included framework on Mac OS X).  more problematic is tiffio.h which is found in the PNG framework on Mac OS X, and it a different version from what INTERNAL_LIBTIFF assumes.  either need to not set that or (solution being used now) make it a local include.
