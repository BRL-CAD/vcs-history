look into using hsregex as an update to libregex - our copy of Spencer's libregex appears to be one of the older ones.  I'm wondering too if we should be including Spencer's COPYRIGHT file the way FreeBSD and some of the Linux distros appear to... updating to the newer one would avoid that concern.
