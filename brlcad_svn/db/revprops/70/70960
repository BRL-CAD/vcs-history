expand more thoughts on color API.  instead of duplicating seed and randomness concepts in libbu, which are libbn domain, separate low-level parsing (which may hook into platform-specific facilitieslike x11) from sampling (which should be platform agnostic).  this would let us create standard color sets or randomly draw 'good' colors based on easily specified criteria.
