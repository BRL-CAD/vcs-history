Turn off the use of CPU_ZERO and MD_CONF_ENABLE_PROGRESS bits that needed mtSignalWaitTimeout.  Strip down tinycthread bits to those actually used and build them as part of librt.  Do the same for adrt, and remove tinycthread as a separately managed library.  This is a bit ugly, but is intended as a stopgap measure until after the next release.  At that time, look at moving adrt to C++11 threads and updating the gct_decimation code to newer version, using mmthreads.h.  Untested with MSVC.
