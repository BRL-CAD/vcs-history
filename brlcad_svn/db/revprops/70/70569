Make a stab at using the CMake state push/pop to fully replace any temp variable stash and restore were weredoing manually.  While we're at it, try to eliminate any need to clear CMAKE_C_FLAGS (except the case in BRLCAD_FUNCTION_EXISTS, which is needed for the most inclusive possible test to set up the DECL mechanism of using present-but-undeclared functions).
