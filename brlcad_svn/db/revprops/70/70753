to specify c90/posix era API and get the right set of function
declarations and other other symbols from headers, we must define both
_POSIX_C_SOURCE and _XOPEN_SOURCE. they configure different standards.

the intent is after confirming 1990 standard's support, we'll jump
forward to at least 2013 where we will be safe to assume c11/c++11.

added a comment for the nominal timeframe targets that would make
sense to target and what corresponding *_SOURCE values were current at
that time.  update cmake logic accordingly to use a set of them
(currently using the 1990 and 2000 timeframe sets for debug and
release respectively).  the one stray _XOPEN_SOURCE=500 test for
sys/ipc.h, now removed/incorporated, was a critical culprit causing
inconsistency between cmake function testing and flags used during
compilation.

pulled the sys/sysctl.h header test out as it's a "broken" header on
bsd when compiling in posix mode -- have to define u_int, u_short,
u_long, u_char types.  also added tests for fseeko (implying ftello),
gettimeofday, and time functions.
