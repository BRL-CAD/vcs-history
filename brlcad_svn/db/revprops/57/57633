Add the ability to search to do a 'flat' search where every object in the .g file is a toplevel starting point for search.  As long as we are at it, add the same ability to specific paths as well.  Right now, the | symbol is added to the beginning of the search path to identify it as a flat search.  For non-full-path searches the results will be the same (for more processing overhead) but it does make a difference for the results if full path output is of interest.
