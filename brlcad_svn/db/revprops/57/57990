applying refactoring rule-of-three (Ro3) instead of DRY for the attribute qsort() callback.  it's only called twice and requires private API to make it span attr.c for little value and hinders encapsulation.  this caller should probably be calling ged_attr() anyways but the format is slightly different, warrants testing.
