reverting r57867 for a variety of reasons: this module should not rely on BRLCAD_* logic (it's implemented as a proper CMake extension), should be testing 'inline' first or we can end up with different inline behavior on c99 compilers, and this change didn't update the documentation that was specific on the ordering and reasoning.  the problem is that this needs to be tested *after* any std flags are set to ensure 'inline' will correctly fail the test.
