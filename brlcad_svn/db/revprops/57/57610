Needing a unique list of directory pointers back from a search is probably going to be common - at least, comb already uses that style in several calls - so duplicating that logic multiple times is a no-go.  Wrap up the logic into another simple function, since most of the 'search types' under contemplation earlier actually end up being toplevel path list generator options and the return table type for this scenario is a table of pointers instead of a table of full paths (latter has a non-standard freeing obligation).
