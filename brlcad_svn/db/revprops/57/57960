/* */ comment within a /* */ comment results in a syntax error, but I'm not convinced we should be introducing these as BU API.  They don't fit the design and are not functions we can portably implement.  while fileno() is also unlikely to NOT exist (similar to inline), there may be other options (like converting callers to FILE*'s or forcing it on as a low-level platform intrinsic)
