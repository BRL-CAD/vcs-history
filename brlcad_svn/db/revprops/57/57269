Changed logic in the 'pipe' solid raytracing code in function rt_pipe_elim_dups(). This code removed single hit from hit list when next hit dist < 0.00001 and next hit from same surface. This caused an error in grazing cases where you have legitimate in/out hits on same surface but less than 0.00001 dist. For the pipe we don't expect to hit the same surface within such a small distance unless it is a grazing case in which we really want to remove both hits. Also changed the hardcoded '0.00001' constant to the internal distance tolerence. Also removed related conditional that reported the original error and bailed.
