Changes to 'libbrep' function 'pullback_samples_from_closed_surface' to correct valgrind warnings that uninitialized memory was being accessed and also fix intermittent seg-faults. The problem was sometimes when 'prev_pt' was used it was undefined. Additional code was added to help debugging. These problems were encountered using the 'step-g' converter. More testing is needed.
