More search API work.  The comb example makes the case for making it trivially easy to handle either lists or individual paths, so structure the API that way - db_search_path, db_search_paths, etc.  comb.c builds but is currently untested - need to test.  Should be just about ready to start marking functions deprecated for the old search API.
