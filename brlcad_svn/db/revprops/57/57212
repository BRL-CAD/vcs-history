rename the now-bu_-prefixed ntohd/ntohf/htond/htonf functions as belonging to the 'cv' data conversion package since their arguments are more similar (they convert arrays of values).  proper would have been to match the style of the [nh]to[gn][ls]-style functions taking just one value and returning it as a uint32_t/uint64_t accordingly, like the new windows functions now do (which we probably can/should leverage in our implementation).
