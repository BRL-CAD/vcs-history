address the additional test cases that were not being handled where the %s format specifier had precision and/or field lengths specified for left/right padded alignment.  the code was written to account for the padding, but it wasn't actually being called because the lengths weren't captured.  we don't want to capture them in the earlier loop because it screws up assumptions for some of the other specifier cases.  this fixes sf bug #347 reported by lee butler (bu_log does not honor string field widths).
