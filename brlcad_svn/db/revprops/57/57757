clarify and reorganize change policy comments so that it's clear that we characterize interface changes into one of three categories.  this affords a place to mention our policy on allowing NEW api to change as needed while it's being actively developed, as well as clarifying minimally impacting changes to any release, and being then more strict about our deprecation policy requirement.
