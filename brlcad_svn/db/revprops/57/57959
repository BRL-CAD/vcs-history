should not be using WIN32, use the corresponding feature we care about, i.e., HAVE_WINSOCK_H, to initialize the networking library on windows.  also should NOT be testing __STD_VERSION__ (and it was wrongly testing __STD_VERSION value).  toggle instead on HAVE_GETHOSTNAME.  this sig should probably change as this is not libbu's memory management style.
