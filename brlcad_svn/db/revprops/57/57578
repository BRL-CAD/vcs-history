Switch the core search logic from using struct db_full_path_list to struct bu_ptbl, which is what should have been done originally since it would have avoided introducing a specialized type just for search.  This will allow the new API to be defined without using db_full_path_list, and allow both the struct and the functions using it to be gradually replaced and deprecated.
