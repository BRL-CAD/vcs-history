Carry the 'flat' search concept to its logical limit.  If the flat modifier is passed without either a local top level search path, a full path toplevel search path, or a specific object it runs a search that iterates over the database objects without walking any trees.  This search has the potential to be a great deal faster when doing type or name filtering searches for objects where full paths aren't needed, but will result in depth aware options not functioning.
