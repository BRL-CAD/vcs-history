for some reason, 'create interp' goes through a different initialization process which causes a failure to find init.tcl if we try to run uninstalled.  it checks [tcl::pkgconfig get scriptdir,runtime] but does not respect $tcl_library.  it DOES, however, respect env(TCL_LIBRARY) so make sure we set that too when we're initializing unless the user already has it set to something.
