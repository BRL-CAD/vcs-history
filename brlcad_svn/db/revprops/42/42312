Have tclcadAutoPath look for share/brlcad/ - should have the same impact as using bu_brlcad_root in the tcl scripts.  This has the drawback of only allowing the build dir executables to run when run from the build toplevel, so perhaps the share/brlcad path should be augmented by knowledge based on the executable path and the current working dir...
