not entirely clear what the compiler is complaining about here with the two (const point_t *) parameters to rt_metaball_find_intersection().  the problem has something to do with point_t being an array typedef.  instead of getting the address during the call, get the point_t address beforehand with an explicit cast to keep things quiet. (gcc 4.2.1)
