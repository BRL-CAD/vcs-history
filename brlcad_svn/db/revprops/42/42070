revert the conversion of the bot face/vertex/normal arrays from being size_t back to int.  additionally, convert the remainder of bot struct size types over to size_t completely.  this propagates hundreds of ancillary changes (more than 400) but provides the added benefits of more extensive value range on some platforms, better warning/bug detection, and more consistently making size types be unsigned so no negative values is inherent.
