This gets past the initial bu_malloc error, but we've got some kind of weirdness going on here.  The RT_CK_SEGS test in recordHit fails with what looks like a bad magic error - printing out the seg list in debug shows a lot of strange looking numbers, and commenting out the check shows a lot of one hit reports and a visible rtgl raytrace (e.g. aside from the errors it largely succeeds.)  rtgl code hasn't changed in quite a while, so something must have changed out from under it...
