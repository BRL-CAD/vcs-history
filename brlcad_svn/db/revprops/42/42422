Interesting... when launching bwish from the root install dir (e.g. ./bin/bwish) the return of bu_brlcad_data was not a full path (or even strictly speaking a relative path unless you add an implicit '.') and archer didn't start.  This is a bit of a corner case, but still should work - try to make it more robust.
