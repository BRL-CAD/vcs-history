this huge update represents the remainder compilation quieting of all the converters.  missing params, exact floating point comparisons, shadowed variables, unused params, long string literals, signedness mismatching, size_t updates and more so that STRICT_BUILD works clean (on Mac gcc 4.0.1).  several days to complete, more than 1300 (minor) changes.
