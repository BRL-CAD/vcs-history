eat our own dogfood.  all of the DIR_* macros were deprecated a couple years ago in r32755 and renamed to include an RT_ prefix.  even though this is a minimally impacting change according to our present-day deprecation rules, continue with the deprecation since this will likely affect third-party code.  update all of our uses to use RT_DIR_*.
