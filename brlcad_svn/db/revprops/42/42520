fix a bug tom found where a '-' left-justify specifier was getting ignored if the value was positive.  the code already supported negative lengths for left-justified printing, so the fix is really trivial to just record the flag and justify accordingly.  interestingly enough, at least with the bsd libc on mac os x 10.6, -* with a negative length (i.e., a double-negative) also left-justifies, so we match that behavior here as well.  technically not user visible since we don't have any printing code using a literal 'i' as far as I know.
