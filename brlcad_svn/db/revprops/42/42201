remove brlcadDataPath since you really don't want to look for '.' unless you absolutely have to, otherwise you risk getting a non-usable /usr/brlcad default.  looking for the subdirectories individually makes them try the run-time relative path first, which means we don't even need to try a separate 'src' search unless it's for items that are in a different place hierarchically in the source tree than they are after install.
