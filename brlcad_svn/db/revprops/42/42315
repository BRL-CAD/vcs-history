really can't think of a better way to do this.  suggestions?  still need to verify, but different versions of Mac OS X use different debug symbols types and are not in sync with gdb (i.e., -ggdb3 doesn't work across library boundaries on 10.4).  cheat and call the sw_vers command to get the system version, used that to test for a debug debug flag type.
