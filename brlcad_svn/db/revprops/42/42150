follow suit and provide another BU_STR_EQUAL() macro for comparing two strings for equality.  this is similar to the STREQ recommendation by the ibm developerworks best practices article (http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-hook_duttaC.html) so that developers can use equality as a truthfulness return value consistently.  there are approximately 1400 present uses of strcmp() in BRL-CAD that can use this macro.
