massive restructure in order to fix a bug assuming that variables are accessible after a longjmp.  quite a chore to quell the warning due to a bug in pre 4.3 gcc, but seems to be possible to quiet the warning if we start a new frame (and don't access the var/arg after that call).  some testing, seems to work.
