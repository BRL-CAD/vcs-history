apply a fix for sf bug 3159020 reported by jra regarding asc2g's failure to recognize the 'color' command.  this was due to libged refactoring where 'db color' was no longer valid.  this fix restores the migrated commands as subcommands of db, iterating over the list and running the command against the current wdbp nad stashing the result.  should once again be able to successfully run: g2asc ktank.g new.asc && asc2g new.asc newtank.g
