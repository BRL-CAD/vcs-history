seems over-complicated, simplify.  just compare the first to the second, and the second to the first since all we do is print both if there's a difference.  fix two bugs in the process, one that caught colortable changes with g2asc + asc2g of ktank when there were none due to resetting the wrong found1 var to zero in the found2's loop.  the second was printing color commands if we're v4.
