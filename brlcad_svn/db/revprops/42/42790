A variety of fixes and cleanups - had broken Tcl/Tk search, got it working - more advanced options cleanup, got things pretty much where they should be now.  Move termlib logic into FindTERMLIB.cmake so it can work in the third party logic.  Added new ability to the ThirdParty.cmake code - can now FORCE enabling and disabling of any given library, over and above the ENABLE_ALL style logic.  Hopefully that will allow mimicking the autotools ./configure --enable-all --disable-*** style option setting.
