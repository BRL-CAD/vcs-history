this is likely the cause of the build failure that tom browder expressed on the mailing list where compilation in src/conv failed due to some c++ warning.  while the majority of c++ code (step, intaval) compiles without -Werror, the 3dm-g converter sources were being compiled with the same AM_CPPFLAGS which now includes -Werror.  to make 3dm-g not compile without the strict flags, they have to be distributed to all the other binaries accordingly.
