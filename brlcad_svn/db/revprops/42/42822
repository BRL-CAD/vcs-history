Eeek.  This appears to be a working per-directory noprod solution.  Done the best I can for convenience vs. policy - CMP0002 forbids non-unique target names, and hence excludes a 'make noprod' rule for each directory.  Even forcing that to OLD, get some odd behavior with the toplevel 'make noprod' rule (not surprisingly, the policy is there for a reason).  Hence, there is a toplevel make noprod command and in subdirectories 'make noprod' becomes 'cmake -P ./cmake_noprod.cmake'
