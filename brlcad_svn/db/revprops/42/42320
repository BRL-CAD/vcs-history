Have bu_brlcad_root take advantage of realpath - bu_getprogname returns no path information now, and so is almost completely useless for this purpose.  This needs more testing and may not be the final 'approved' way to get this working, so it's only going into CMake branch for now, but it works in every case tried so far for both installed and build dir.
