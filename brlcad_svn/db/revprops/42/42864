Let's try this again - see if we can do without tclcad_tcl_library.  Using private Tcl functions is Not Good, particularly when it's for debug printing.  also removing the found_init_tcl call to TclSetLibraryPath - same basic problem and the comment says it doesn't do what we might expect it to anyway.
