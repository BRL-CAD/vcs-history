implement initial support for reading in binary-incompatible v4 geometry database files without the need for performing a dbupgrade on matching hardware.  user specifies a flip via a flag to opendb within mged that flips the version number (i.e., dbi_version changes from 4 to -4), marks the database read-only (mixed encodings would be disaster), and proceeds to flip the floating point falues during import.  possibly only works for arbs, halfspaces, tgc, grips, torii, and ellipsoids.
