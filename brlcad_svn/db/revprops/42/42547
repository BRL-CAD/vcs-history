add four new macros: VINITALL(), VINIT_ZERO, MAT_INIT_IDN, and MAT_INIT_ZERO.  they create initialization statements suitable for declaration initialization so you don't have to declare variables and then initialize them on separate lines with corresponding VSETALL(), VSETALL(0.0), MAT_IDN(), and MAT_ZERO() calls.  this idea was prompted by former Joe Doliner (via an otherwise unusable patch 2805742) for common vector/matrix initialization.
