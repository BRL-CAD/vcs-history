behold the annoyance of -pedantic.  believe it or not, even for ISO C++, variable sized arrays are but a mere gcc extension.  if you want variable-sized, you either have to new/delete/malloc/free (bleh) or leverage std::vector templatization.  the latter is fortunately a trivial declaration tweak and the rest should behave accordingly.
