bu_brlcad_root should ideally only be called with one subdirectory for portability, then use tcl's [file join] on the rest of the path.  this is likely the problem that necessitated adding '.exe' extensions to the binaries for windows because the lower-level C code was trying to stat the file.  this should simplify things nicely.
