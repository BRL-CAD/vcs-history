Start prototyping a system to use the GLOB feature of CMake to test whether our lists of files are complete - may be able to work out an EXTRA_DIST like feature, although this should probably only be run when a specific target is called and needs to handle all the various directories... may or may not be worth it, we could just do a clean svn checkout prior to packaging up for distribution.
