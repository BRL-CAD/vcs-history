May be a few stray files remaining (need a systematic diff) but this is the last major piece to create a duplicate of the installed share directory in the build dir.  tclcadAutoPath simpilfies down to a question of where the root and data dirs are, if I'm understanding their usage correctly - I don't think I've got it right yet but clearly this should simplify things dramatically.
