copy-paste code hell.  remove the proliferation of rtprivate.h inclusion from a slew of places where it actually isn't used; they just needed the optical.h header.  for the rest that did use it, remove the half-assing k&r-style declarations in rtoptical.  this cascades a slew of updates to rtuif code that didn't match the signature, and didn't match the caller.
END
