ouch, tricky one.  ISO C doesn't actually permit dlsym() to work the way it works with the need to convert a void* to a function pointer so the compiler has to be cajouled.  we trick it with a cast through an intptr_t, which is a type big enough to hold a pointer address, albeit not necessarily a function pointer.  the rest of the changes are just consistency with the callback mechanism type returning an int and constness.
