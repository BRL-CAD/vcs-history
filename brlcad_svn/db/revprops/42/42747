refactor principle of DRY -- Don't Repeat Yourself.  user usage statements don't belong in the public header regardless, but they're also already listed in the manual pages and src/tclscripts/mged/help.tcl and the bastard replications for archer and rtwizard (Db.tcl and Ged.tcl).  approx 700 line reduction.  ultimately, usage should be defined in the source C file directly in src/libged
