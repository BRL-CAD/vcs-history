enable automatic flipping of a binary-incompatible v4 geometry database if rt_db_flip_endian() returns true.  this should only occur if flipping the database was observed to fix ALL matrix member failures during a quick db_open() scan of the file.  the user should be able to force flipped values in mged with 'opendb -f'.
