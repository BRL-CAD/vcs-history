tom added sorting to the mged attr show command so that attributes are now displayed in alphabetical order instead of unsorted creation order.  should improve readability.  rewording NEWS line to fit on one line (two line comments are the exception when there are multiple authors) and moving to top of stack so it's in proper chronological order.
