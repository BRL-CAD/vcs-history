Get a little more sophisticated.  Still do the FILE(COPY up front, which is much quicker and doesn't slow the build down, but allow the user to optionally enable the data target generation, which will add the data and documentation files to the make logic at the expense of a large increase in make targets (and corresponding build slowdown).  The initial build will still copy all the files even with the FILE(COPY if the targets are on, since the timestamps will be older on the copied files.  Use the new macros for most of the data - need to cook up something similar for src/other builds eventually and come to a decision about handling the headers.
