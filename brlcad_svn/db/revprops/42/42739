mged's opendb command now has a -f flip option for reading in a binary-incompatible v4 geometry database with a flipped endianness translation.  the files are made read-only but may then be run through keep or dbupgrade to clean them up.  this closes out a long-standing request from users and a class of modeling/rendering failures due to the platform-specific nature of v4 files, albeit only minimally tested with a few sample files.
