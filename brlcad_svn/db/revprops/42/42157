more -D elimination - a lot of these defines probably aren't even needed in CMake builds, as they don't seem to be used by the C code and CMake is handling the generation of whatever config files are needed itself... for the ones that are, the only code change is to include the generated header.  Definitely more cleanup to do on these to reduce the build logic to the functioning minimum.
