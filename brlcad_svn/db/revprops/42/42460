wow, now that I can finally reproduce and investigate ... FIX the several-year-old bug where compilation would fail on some Mac OS X systems (10.6+?) with a 'dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/brlcad/dev-7.18.1//lib/libwdb.19.dylib' message (and subsequent crash report).  the problem is actually due to a bug in libtool where their temp_rpath variable was getting appended to another path variable but without a : between the two path sets.  we patch libtool due to a separate -all_load bug where temp_rpath was getting set to 'TCL_PATH:' causing a bad DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in the resulting libtool wrapper script for asc2g.  the fix could have been as simple as add a trailing colon manually, but instead I'm just going to remove the line since 1) TCL/TK path logic shouldn't be in this file and 2) the commit history nor file indicate why that line is patched, and most importantly 3) it works on 10.6 and libtool 2.2.4 without it.  long overdue.
