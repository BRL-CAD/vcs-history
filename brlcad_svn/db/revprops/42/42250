myself, daniel, and cliff arrived at a(n unverified) fix for the mged crash reported by tom browder on the devel mailing list where it'd crash if you didn't have one of the default editors installed due to unreliable strcmp() behavior when provided NULL arguments.  fix was propagated throughout brl-cad code with new bu_strcmp() interface from daniel.
