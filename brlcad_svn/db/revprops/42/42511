It's the quantum bug, when you look at it it changes.  A recompile now produces a whole new problem - Splash is not recognized as a command despite (apparently) it being in the path, and despite running successfully with the old compile.  Commenting out the splash screen results in a series of Archer errors.  Auuuugh.
