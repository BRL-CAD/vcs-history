slew of the remainder verbose compilation warnings for src/conv.  ridiculous repetition on the converters, yet frustratingly slightly inconsistent enough to require careful manual review and tweaking.  added process_boolean() and sometimes process_triangulation() functions to all of the converters that perform libbu exception handling so that we can quell warnings about data be clobbered if an exception occurred.  all of the process_boolean() functions are essentially identical.  the process_triangulation() functions, however, call the specific convertion function they need for the given output format.  should take that as a func param, but for another day.
