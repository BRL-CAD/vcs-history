Take the plunge... Docbook 4.5 is getting old and development efforts in the Docbook community have shifted to 5.0, which came out in Feb 2008.  Updated docbook-xsl to docbook-xsl-ns (same version, 1.76.1) and convert xml files to Docbook 5.  The local copy of the dtd does not appear to be needed any longer.  Note that the conversion to Docbook 5 was done automatically using the upgrade tool, so review will be needed - the 'Converted by db4-upgrade' comment has been deliberately left in the files and should only be removed after review to ensure the files are properly set up using Docbook 5.0
