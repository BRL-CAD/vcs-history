fixed asc2g color command lines.  this is a fix for sf bug 3159020 reported by jra where he showed g2asc + asc2g on ktank resulted in an error message.  bug was due to libged refactoring where 'db color' was no longer valid.  the fix restored several migrated commands as subcommands of db, iterating over the list and running the command against the current wdbp nad stashing the result.
