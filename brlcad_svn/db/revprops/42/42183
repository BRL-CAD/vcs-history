one of the more complicated ways to handle BU_SETJUMPing so that variables set before the jump and accessed afterwards do not have their values clobbered when a jump occurs.  solution is to pull just exactly the try/catch code out into their own functions so there are no variables in that frame that might be clobbered in the first place.  this is done twice here.
