This results in a bit of a proliferation of build targets, but make all of the tclscripts and data part of the actual build logic.  The effect of this should be to allow the developer to edit the tcl script in the source dir, type 'make' in the build dir, and have the build dir copy use the updated tclscript without any manual copying or running of CMake.  In principle, this should be done for all data in the build dir - it's less likely to be seen on less frequently changed files, but will be all the more vexing in those cases...
