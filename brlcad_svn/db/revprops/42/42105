this is a really tricky one.  quell warnings about variables getting clobbered after a longjmp or vfork by making them all static.  we can do this here because they're all just main() variables fortunately.  bu's jump mechanism uses setjump, so an implementation could clobber local non-static non-volatile variables.  this tricking making them static works or it would have also worked to wrap the BU_SETJUMP/BU_UNSETJUMP calls into functions that are passed parameters (i.e., no variables in that frame).
