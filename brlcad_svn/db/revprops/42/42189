Alright, I'm tired of fighting with trying to get the custom tclscripts to run cleanly in parallel when they're doing copy commands after the btclsh script runs.  Put copies of the tcl files in the build dir and run the scripts there.  Simplifies the logic and avoids the hackery of copying things around as part of the custom command.
