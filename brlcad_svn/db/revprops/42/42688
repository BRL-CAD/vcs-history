add an initial working implementation of a routine to help detect when a v4 geometry file seems corrupt due to endianness.  this walks over all matrices of combinatino members and tests whether they preserve axis perpendicularity and that scaling/rotation elements are unitized.  if a matrix fails, it flips it and tries again to see if flipping fixes the problem.  if ALL failures were successfully fixed by flipping, then true is returned.
