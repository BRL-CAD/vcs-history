fix a bug with the ls command where it was printing NULL or garbage for the object type if you requested an ls -la long listing.  this only occurred for v4 geometry databases but was due to an assumption in the code that d_minor_type is a suitable index into the rt_functab[] (which it's not).  other commands need fixing too.
