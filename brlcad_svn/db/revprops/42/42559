quell verbose compilation warnings by checking the return status for libc i/o functions like fread/fwrite/system.  avoid clobbering variables due to bu exception handling by marking variables static and moving the critical section into its own function frame.  make sure variables are initialized before use (even when the compiler is wrong).
