sigh, no response from the libtool mailing list on this issue so restore the hack that makes libtool binary wrapper scripts work on Mac OS X.  we sneak in paths to the Tcl/Tk compile-time lib directories so that they'll get automatically added to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.  due to suck in the way temp_rpath is handled, the trailing ':' is required otherwise the path will get munged with the next pathlist incorrectly.  document why this oddity is even in here, why it's needed in order for make test and apps like mged to work prior to make install.
