dbupgrade (along with ALL other BRL-CAD commands) now supports reading in binary-incompatible v4 files.  the low-level librt db_open() inteface for reading in files will now auto-convert a v4 file to an alternate endian format if it finds that flipping all combination member matrices makes them valid.  for safety, that means if an old v4 has even one actual bad matrix (so that it's invalid regardless of being flipped), then the dbupgrade cannot be performed as-is.  in that instance, the database should be opened with mged -f and corrected, deleted, and/or kept accordingly.  the detection and flip behavior is presently fully automatic without any user-override control.
