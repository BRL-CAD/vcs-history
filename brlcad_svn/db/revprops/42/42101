the ON_OBJECT_IMPLEMENT() and ON_VIRTUAL_OBJECT_IMPLEMENT() macros are followed in code with semicolons so the macro itself needs to end with a statement that requires a semicolon.  a simple reordering of the first line suffices.  remainder of fixes are stray semicolons mysteriously following functions.
