the user needs SOME mechansim to override automatic behavior in case there is some pressing need, so provide for a LIBRT_V4FLIP boolean environment variable.  if set, the value will be interpreted as an override to enable or disable flipping so you can flip a file irrespective of the automatic detection.  setting the flag to false will revert to old behavior.  setting to true will flip even if the application provided no override and automatic detection would have failed
