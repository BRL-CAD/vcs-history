Indirect table entry moved back to sp_offset (from sp_hook)
because the XMP didn't like having a data space address stuffed
into a function pointer (instruction space address).
sp_offset is now always &element;  when this is NOT a byte offset
(such as on the Cray), compensation is applied here in parse.c
