Added a trip_count fag to prevent the distance correction to be
recomputed for every ray.  Also, added a pl_color() prior to
pdv_3line() so that the first line will be colored, and changed the
pdv_3move() to pdv_cont() since the air_thickness was not supposed
to be skipped, but should be drawn in color.  Rtg3 compiles and 
"try" produces the expected results.  The color and plotting 
routines could not be tested due to lack of proper equipment at
my end.
