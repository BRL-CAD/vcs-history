conditionalize the compilation of libpc depending on whether the limits and istream STL headers are available.  this keeps things going on older compilers (e.g., gcc 2.95) where compilation will otherwise fail and cannot be easily worked around due to the use of boost (which extensively uses up-to-date/compliant stl).
