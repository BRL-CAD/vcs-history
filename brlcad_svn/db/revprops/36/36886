add two more 'would be nice' features (that we won't likely get to for a while, but within scope regardless) of being able to extract a polygonal or even point-cloud representation for geometry.  polygonal is straight-forward, similar to wireframe, but point-cloud adds in that interesting concept of non-blocking streaming event results (getting the points flowing across the wire as they are calculated).  Most of the rest of the GS calls are blocking calls that get their data immediately.
