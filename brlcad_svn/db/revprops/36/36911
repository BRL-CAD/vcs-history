refactor the Tk compilation testing to allow Tk to auto-disable if there isn't a suitable X11/AquaTk or other subsystem available to build tk ourselves and there isn't a suitable system library that seems to work right.  this should let Tk be optional at least during configure time (compile may still have some assumptions) and will make it blather a strong message with delay if MGED's Tk GUI is getting turned off.
