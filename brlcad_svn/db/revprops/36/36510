oops, meant to apply this to trunk..  workaround patch for a gcc 4.0.1 optimization bug where it ends up outputting bad assembly causing a relocation linker failure. (local recloation for address 0x00... in section __text does not target section __const) this avoids getting a const wchar_t* directly from a wide string literal, instead going through the ON_wString class.
