John Pritchard aka comoc reported build progress/failures to our forum ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/forums/forum/362511/topic/3446934?message=7745246 ) where HAVE_IEEEFP_H is being used by openNURBS but our test was removed.  readd the test with a comment so it's clear that the test pertains to a src/other target.
