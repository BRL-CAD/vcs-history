Swap in tkpng for the small subset of tkimg we were previously using - also try to set up tkpng to support 'proper' package require use.  Archer appears to be the only app using it at the moment, so remove tkimg loading code and package require tkpng instead.  As of this checking tkpng won't build out of box in all cases - the current src/other/tkpng is a pristine 0.9 tarball.  Next checking will add specific changes to build logic for BRL-CAD.
