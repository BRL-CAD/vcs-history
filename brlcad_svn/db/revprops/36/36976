there probably be little dragons here.  replace the strip_crlf() win32-specific hack with a more generalized solution that just trims space on the line parsed in.  it's not clear why they even matter with bu_fgets() reading in lines portably other than it printing \n\r's into the result string (which then also just begs for space trimming).  untested.
