Take a few baby steps towards dm-tk + aquatk.  Try to turn on ITK when aquatk is on, itcl is being built and x11 is off, avoid a few X11/Xutil.h includes in the DM_TK sections, disable the tk framebuffer stuff until the tk display manager gets sorted out.  Trying this with aquatk as it is a good way to ensure no X11 requirements in the tk display manager - hopefully this doesn't break anything...
