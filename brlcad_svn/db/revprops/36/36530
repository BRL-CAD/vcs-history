Cleaned up ellipse code to directly build ellipse from bezier(similar to the 
hyperbola) versus using openNURBS ellipse routine allowing for better control
of the curve parameterization. Also removed unit conversion of curve endpoints
for trimmed curves now done in one place the trimmed_curve parent.
