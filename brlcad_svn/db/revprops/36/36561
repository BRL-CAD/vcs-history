choosing the weakest tolerance, VUNITIZE_TOL, returns our conversion regression to a working state.  there are v4 stored matrices that are within default computation tolerance (0.0005 -- actually around 1.0e16), but not nearly tight enough for SMALL_FASTF's 1.0e-77.  still failing star regression though.
