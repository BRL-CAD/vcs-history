add an initial high-level integration test harness for chatting with the geometry service.  this stubs out some basic connections, probing and reporting on the status of functionality.  the client and server classes next need to get filled out with an interaction with the actual GS protocol (either low-level or via classes) but the intent is a dependency-free test of the protocol.
