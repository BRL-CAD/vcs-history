Long overdue rewiring of the Docbook make system.  This should support both parallel making of articles and out-of-dir building.  The handling of the directories in the builddir is a bit crude, but seems to be effective for the moment.  Tested only with html/man building on OSX - need pdf testing and other platforms.
