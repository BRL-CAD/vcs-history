quell warning about fprintf without a string literal.  that was intentionally done to avoid fprintf needing to utilize an expansion buffer (whether on stack or heap) in case we're crashing hard.  instead, change up the fprintf with an fwrite since that's the intent anyways, to just write out some bytes.  make the file stream unbuffered while we're at it.
