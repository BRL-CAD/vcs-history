reword to make mged case consistent (always lower in summary lines, upper in writeup prose).  cliff got menus working conditionally in mged (via expansion of the dm devel command) including preserving az/el orientation in the working view - probably need to do more state preservation stuff later (e.g., viewsize, zoom).
