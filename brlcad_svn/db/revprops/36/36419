Added tolerance argument to getSurfacePoint(), added quick return if
point found within BREP_SAME_POINT_TOLERANCE, else now iterates
through looking for closest point within tolerance argument. Also
added BREP_EDGE_MISS_TOLERANCE buffer around 3D bounding box to make
sure 3D edges fall within bounding boxes (needed when generating 
pullbacks on loose edges).Also moved BREP_EDGE_MISS_TOLERANCE and 
BREP_SAME_POINT_TOLERANCE definitions to opennurbs_ext.h

END
