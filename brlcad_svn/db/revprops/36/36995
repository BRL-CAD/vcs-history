include the more legally explicit language shown on http://opennurbs.org/docs.htm where rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell are clearly granted.  the language in the readme.txt has the same intention, but not nearly as well-stated with loose language, so include the website text here verbatim alongside the sources to avoid confusion and doubt.
