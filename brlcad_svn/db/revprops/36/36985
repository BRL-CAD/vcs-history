quell the warnings from make about overriding commands for target, ignoring commands for target, duplicate scripts for target, etc.  seems to be an automake bug where multiple rules were getting output for each object file type, but may have been something in our template.  avoid the issue by building a noinst convenience library first and linking step-g against it.
