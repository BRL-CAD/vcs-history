oof. this can have some widespread repercussions.. VEQUAL was using exactness testing, relying on stable representation comparisons (leaving a false sense of behavior by callers).  SMALL_FASTF is what we define as the minimum representation capacity delta of the hardware, so we use that now instead.  this will change behavior and require additional testing, but is what the vmath routine needs to be.  the callers (which at a glance are patch-g, shading/lighting, and tessellation/facetization) may need to be adjusted to accommodate but a cursory review of their calls looked okay with the added fuzz.  actually hoping this will help stabilize some of the more obscure unreliable tessellation failures.
