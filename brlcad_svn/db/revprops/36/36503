At long last, what appears to be a solution to the png image in pdf file problem when using fop.  Generate a config file that sets the base path and add it to the fop call.  Requires ALL xml files to use the ../../pathname convention, but since xinclude required that anyway what the heck.  Start with key files, will follow with massive image moving.
