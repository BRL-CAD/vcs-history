well, screw me.  no savings on eliminating four sqrt() calls due to an egregious number of malloc calls (two per bot face) to allocate a tri_specific and space for normals.  holy flying bat crap.  tri_specific's interface needs to be improved.  made prep use the caller's tolerance instead of magic numbers.
