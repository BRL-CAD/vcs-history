add compiler tests for strict compilation flags (-pedantic -W -Wall -Werror) along with -Wno-lang-lang which is needed due to tcl.h's use of the c99 long long construct.  this set of strict compilation flags can be enabled on a per directory basis using the STRICT_FLAGS variable as directories are cleaned up.  additionally, add -std=c89 to the compile line to make our compliance goal explicit (at least if we're using gcc).
