change the signature of bu_argv_from_string() to take a const string instead of modifying the input string.  this requires the caller to deallocate the array elements (with bu_free_argv() or bu_free_array()), but is safer than relying on them to not modify/delete what the gave as input that the argv was referring to. still doesn't decode yet.
