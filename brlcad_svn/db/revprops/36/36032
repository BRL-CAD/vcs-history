tweaks to the script to compensate for a bug in bsd sed where it's getting stuck in an infinite loop on daniel ro√überg's unicode name.  perl parses it fine so that'll do.  also make the script try a little harder to find the assignee by looking at the line immediately following the current revision, in case someone updates the authors as a separate commit from the description (as was the case for 7.15).
