Use the cues from FaceBound "Orientation" setting to determine loop direction consistency instead of openNURBS BREP LoopDirection() function.
Unitized ON_Line::Direction() used in intersectLines() function, large line magnitudes were causing some tolerence problems with bn_isect_line3_line3().
Gutted Circle::LoadONBrep(), now subdivides arc based on angular extents and builds NURB directly. (Will need to do the same for Ellipse)
Cleanup start/end point code in all the Conic curve loading.
