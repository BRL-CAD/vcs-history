the changes applied to more carefully call db_dirhash() during rt_free_rti/rt_clean/db_free_tree/rt_free_soltab fix the crash reported by dwayne kregel whereby mged would fault on a null pointer dereference after doing a killall on some primitive and then attempting a Pick Edit-Primitive operation.  not convinced the rtip region reference (and the subsequent soltab entry it was crashing on) doesn't have some other book-keeping problem given the ordinary iteration over regp's, but everything seems to be working as expected again.  couldn't provoke another crash for what was a reliable crash.  thx dwayne
