bring vshoot up-to-date with the current API, eliminating a lot of old cruft that has changed.  eliminated the duplication with non-vector helper functions (they're in shoot.c).  updated to bitvs and ptbls except didn't make the necessary bookkeeping mods needed for rt_boolfinal() to keep track of finished and waiting segments.  that means this will NOT actually work, but should at least compile cleanly once again.
