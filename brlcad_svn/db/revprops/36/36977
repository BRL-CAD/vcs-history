rename the BOOL and BOOLS classes to BOOLEAN and BOOLEANS respectively so as not to conflict with openNURBS (and other codes that commonly use BOOL as a simple boolean type).  this also conveniently makes the class name lengths match the corresponding LOGICAL and LOGICALS classes.  unsure about the Bool->Boolean declarations and how they come into play, alas, so have to see if those need to be unrolled for the actual step parsing.
