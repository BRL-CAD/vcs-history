found the cause of the EDITOR bug.  libged refactoring removed the libdm logic, which ripped out the code needed to invoke editors from within an xterm.  have to rethink how to do this since we obviously shouldn't tie libged to libdm but need to propagate a 'need to invoke from within xterm' somehow
