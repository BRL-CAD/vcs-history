OK, this is very crude and has no awareness of posix locale stuff, but add the ability to toggle doc building using --with-lang compile option.  Currently, only --with-lang=es will do anything, but it will switch off english doc building and build whatever spanish docs are available (currently lesson one).  Needs much more work, but this will get it off the ground.
