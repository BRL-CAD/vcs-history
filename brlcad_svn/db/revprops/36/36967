remove minor_type from the functab interface for import5/export5.  this was apparently only added for binary objects, which needs to know which minor type they are during import.  instead of the object writing out it's minor type during export, it munged the api to have the minor type passed from the raw_external instead.  this moves towards undoing that by removing minor_type from all other objects and making binunif's a special case in db5_io.  once functab is properly encapsulated, this can be revisited to make binunifs aware of their minor type without needing to modify the v5 db format.
