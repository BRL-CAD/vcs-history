expand, clarify, and simplify.  remove the loose concept of 'critical functions' as these rules can be applied pretty uniformly with a little clarification.  one clarification being that the deprecation rules apply to both user and developer interface changes, but only for publicly published interfaces.  be more clear that changes that pass a regex search-and-replace test are generally minimally impacting and okay (but still only during minor releases, not patch releases).
