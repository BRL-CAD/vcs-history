default to no gamma correction, no gAMA chunk, so that the png pixel values should match what was in the framebuffer.  looks like 1.0 is overpowered for mac, 0.6 is closer but still slightly too bright.  turning the chunk off gives correct pixel values.  turns out the -g option was never documented either, so document it along with the new info.  this should reduce surprises due to unexpected color shifts in output images.
