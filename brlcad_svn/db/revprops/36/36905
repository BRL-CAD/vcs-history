Time to start scrubbing and polishing libfb.  As a first cut, remove a lot of specialized code for old devices - these days we're looking at X11, WGL, OGL and Tk.  Doing this as one commit so it's easy to revert if needed, but many of these files were already EXTRA_DIST anyway and it's hard to conceive of a scenario where the work to maintain and update them will be justified.
