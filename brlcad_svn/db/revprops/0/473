Reimplemented drawHobj() to read whole group of Member records
into dynamic memory, rather than doing lots of seeking and small reads.
Also implemented GIFT-style grouping around UNION operations,
to cope with models built that way (all of BRL's models, sigh).
Pure boolean operation can be optained if caller sets extern int
rt_pure_boolean_expresions=1.
