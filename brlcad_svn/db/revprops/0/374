Two fixes from Jeff Hanes and Gary Moss.
1)  if A&B or C&D vectors are very close in magnitude,
    CA_H or DB_H values will be very small (e-9), causing first
    coefficient of the 2nd degree poly to be small (e-18),
    which will be discarded by rootfinder, leaving 1 root.
2)  Test for positive K values is only done if there is at least 1 root.
