Added 'setenv' to sysv header.  Removed old definition setting from libsys/CMakeList.txt that forcibly defined HAVE_MEMSET, HAVE_STRCHR, HAVE_STRDUP, HAVE_STRTOK. Added include of sysv.h to setenv.c to properly export to dll. Added include of sysv.h to mged/attach.c and nirt/nirt.c to properly import setenv symbol. Added sysv definitions for include directory and add sysv library to mged and nirt CMakeList.txt.
