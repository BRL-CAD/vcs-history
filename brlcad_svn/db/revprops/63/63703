Try to remove most of the fixed constants for mallocing - not sure all of these are sensible defaults but nothing seems to break.  Also put the random shuffling back in, but at least in initial testing it doesn't seem to help much.  The Stanford dragon model is too much for this code as it stands, so we'll need to figure out how to fix it at some point.  A gdb interruption after a few minutes seems to indicate we're in chull3d_search a lot, so perhaps there is something about that function or its callees that doesn't scale well.
