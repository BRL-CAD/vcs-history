Checkpoint work boiling Ken Clarkson's hull program (http://www.netlib.org/voronoi/hull.html) down into a single C file for building convex hulls.  So far globals have been put in a struct, all the files have been boiled down to one file, and some libbu/libbn functions have been substituted in for the originals in the file.  At the moment it's still set up for compilation as a single program with file i/o. The next stage will be to get it using libbn data types for I/O.
