apply sf patch #309 (Fixed raytracing with bad texture dimensions) from Stefan Mirea that addresses a texture mapping crash where simply specifying the wrong image dimensions would cause liboptical to read beyond array bounds.  this wraps the texture mapping coordinates around the image space (toroidally) and enhances the red channel to help indicate the error.
