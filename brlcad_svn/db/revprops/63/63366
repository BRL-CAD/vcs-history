Oof.  Still a slew of details to get straight, but replace the ParaView console widget with one based on QTextBrowser, with an eye towards making the results of commands active links to things like tree selections.  Lots of finicky formatting bits down at this level, and to really get the output looking spiffy we'll need to actually generate proper html instead of using <pre>, but this at least demonstrates a successful proof of concept.
