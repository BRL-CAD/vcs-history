sys/socket is both networking and non-networking, which is part why it wasn't originally included but now with 'network' being the nomenclature, it does embiggen inclusion.  it's consequently also why bsocket was named bselect, to avoid having headers with overlapping api (select.h is socket agnostic, sys/socket.h is far more general).  go ahead an include in both for now to see how things shake out but this probably either warrants combining them or going back to the bselect distinction.
