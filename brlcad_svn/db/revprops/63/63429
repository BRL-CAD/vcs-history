Get the fundamental pieces in place for a tool palette in the style of the gimp or krita.  That type of widget doesn't seem to be standard, so combine the Qt FlowLayout example with some custom logic to define a 'QToolPalette' that will have the desired behavior.  Needs a lot of refinement, but seems to be working.
