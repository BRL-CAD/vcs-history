mged needs the tcl/tk dirs (e.g., when using system versions of both), but avoid including our version of the internal Tcl headers since they conflict.  this was of course required because incr tcl reaches into private tcl headers, but it looks like we can avoid including itcl.h entirely by just declaring Itcl_Init() ourselves (which won't likely change).  worked on bsd with system Tcl/Tk but warrants more platform testing.
