Fix memory errors in brep conversion. Use a consistent convention of having the caller pass a newly allocated ON_Brep, and having the callee either fill it out or set it to NULL on error. Previously the ON_Brep argument was sometimes replaced with a new allocation, with the original sometimes deleted by the callee (recursive calls to single_conversion) and sometimes not (rt_sph_brep, rt_tor_brep).
