document the basic application runtime (BAR).  this has been listed as a BRL-CAD project for a number of years now, but is coming to priority with the progression of GCV.  as GCV aims to be a stand-alone product, it needs to be able to leverage libbu/libbn without having the architecture polluted by other libraries down the road.  this will be greatly simplified if libbu/libbn are also turned into a stand-alone product.
