Rewrite the get_subcurves_inside_faces() routine. The prior algorithm had multiple issues, the most significant of which was that we were merging two sets of curve intervals, one in terms of the domain of the 2d intersection curve in the first face, and the second in terms of the 2d curve domain in the second face. The separate 2d curve parameterizations are sometimes the same, but generally are not, which means that we have to convert the intervals to 3d for merging, and then convert the final 3d subcurve intervals back to the equivelent intervals in each of the two distinct 2d curve domains (much harder).
