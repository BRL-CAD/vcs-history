This adds a 'list' option to attr that will accept a regular expression pattern and report a consolidated list of all attributes present on any of the objects matching the pattern in the database.  At the moment it will include hidden objects like _GLOBAL - not sure what the default behavior should be here.  attr get will work on _GLOBAL without needing a flag to work with hidden objects, but of course get (currently) accepts only a single object.
