Break up the task of convex hull calculation into calculating the hulls of subsets of the input vertex array, and then calculating hulls on the sets of hulls to build up to the final hull.  While the previous setup crashed on the Stanford dragon after around 9 hours running, this approach succeeded in about 30 seconds.  It doesn't address whatever the underlying issues are with the hull implementation itself and large data sets, just pre-processes the inputs to avoid dealing with them *as* a large data set.  This will not work in cases where large numbers of vertices are legitimately part of the convex hull - in that case it actually increases run times - and it's still not fast on large models even when it helps, but since large bots of that nature already aren't practical with this code and this does handle at least some situations better go with it for now.
