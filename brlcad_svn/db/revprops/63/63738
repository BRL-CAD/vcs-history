apply gci patch https://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2014/6109916221669376 from michael huang that implements a uv-mapping callback for extrude objects.  unconfirmed whether it works or note, but it's reportedly similar to ebm and still quite a hard / complicated task for a gci task regardless.
