lil more rewording and remove duplicate, per sf patch 313 from stefan mirea that improves mged's -Ccolorval parsing where before it would bu_malloc(0) abort due to bad argument tracking when no objects were displayed.  also make gqa (along with all other librt-based applications) respect the LIBRT_BOT_MINTIE variable by pushing the read check into rt_bot_prep.  this means even third-party librt applications can now benefit too.
END
