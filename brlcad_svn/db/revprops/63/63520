Deprecate db_regexp_match_all, add pattern matching to db_ls.  Need to swap in db_ls instead of the explicit looping in a few places, but at least some of that code looks like it is duplicated in mged and libged... needs more attention.  Glob and match don't have man pages, so not sure yet what they're supposed to do...  Checkpoint a compiling state that works.
