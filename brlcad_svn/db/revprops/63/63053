remove XOR as a boolean operation.  this is predominantly to simplify the API and userland.  on review, looks like xor operations were never published, but they were exposed via adjust and get/put commands.  ideally, we want boolean operations to be encapsulated in a library instead of spread around as switch statements of varying behavior throughout our code.
