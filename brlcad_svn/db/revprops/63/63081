change the signature of rt_brep_boolean() to take a db_op_t instead of a string for the boolean operation so the function doesn't need to concern itself with parsing.  this lets us refactor the op string parsing to be consistent, using db_str2op() instead.  consequently eliminates xor from the brep intersect command, which wasn't working anyways.
