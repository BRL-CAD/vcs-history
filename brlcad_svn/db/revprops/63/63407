Figured out how to trigger the repaint correctly for the related row painting - needed to emit a layoutChanged signal after we're done updating which items are and aren't related to the new selection.  Selections don't normally change the layout, but apparently the branch drawing is updated (naturally enough) only when QTreeView thinks the layout changed.
