Proof of concept stylesheet settings for the whole application.  In principle this is how we will provide a cad application appropriate coloring scheme for the interface out of the box, and user settings will be used to construct settings to override specific aspects of these styles at user request.  Much work will be needed to set up that level of control, so for now just set the defaults and go.
