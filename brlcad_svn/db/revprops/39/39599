add the rest of the english-to-spanish lesson translations to date from Jesica Giudice.  included are lessons 4, 5, 7, & 8.  WOO HOO!.. only 5 remaining!  lessons applied without modification except for 7, which had to be re-encoded for utf-8.  may still need more work but xsltproc seems happier now.
