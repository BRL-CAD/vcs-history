move struct dm dm_wgl down to the bottom in order to avoid forward decls but don't restructure functions to remove them all just yet.  rmeove the few that seem to be kosher for removal.  update slew of k&r signature to ansi-style.  this marks the end of more than 3000 win32/win64 verbose warnings that have been reviewed and/or addressed.
