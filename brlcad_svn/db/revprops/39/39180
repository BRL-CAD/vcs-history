Update to GatewayTest.  Looks as though QT's signals and slots can only operate from an event loop launched from a QApplication or QCoreApplication, NOT a QThread's event loop.

Since QCoreApplication.exec() blocks, there can only be one event loop at any given time.  Thus, my attempts to contain QT-ness to the lower levels of libNetwork have been thwarted, as all applications that use libNetwork will have to be a QApplication/QCoreApplication based.
