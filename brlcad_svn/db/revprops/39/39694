just a quick scan to perform minor ws indent and formatting consistency cleanup on comments and code.  autoalign comment blocks to column 70 for printing/display purposes.  remove embedded tabbings and spaces on types as they are a maintenance cost to maintain and (more importantly) can lead to subtle bugs getting introduced, particularly with pointers.
