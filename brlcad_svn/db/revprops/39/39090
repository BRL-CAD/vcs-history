Start getting a handle on the standard attributes and how they are named in BRL-CAD.  Need to make sure once and for all that all the tools a) set and read values correctly given the new v5 attribute system b) don't do damage through lack of awareness of new attributes (see red bug) and c) correctly read and write attributes to/from files (red is ignoring new values currently - need to fix this, check other tools).
