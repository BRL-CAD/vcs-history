remove the old 'fast path' case when blitting as the assumption that they are short writes is not necessarily true (particularly with very large framebuffers where a subregion may still be 'big').  pack pixels in BGRA order for a slight (25% on write) performance boost on Mac avoiding pixel conversions (bob found this one).  finally, fix double-buffer rendering by making sure to flush after we write before releasing the context -- this fixes single-buffer mode.
