Call this what it is - we're manually specifying the target name for add_library generated by the CMakeLists.txt file for libpng, not overriding what that file specifies.  Need to find a mechanism to get that name up to the parent CMakeLists.txt file without altering the libpng CMakeLists.txt file, but haven't found anything yet.
