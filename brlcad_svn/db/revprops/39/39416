I hate to do this, but the mouse movements should only happen when the mouse is actually over the geometry window, and toplevel binding was messing that up.  Since I can't seem to do 'focus follows mouse' behavior within the Tk widgets 'naturally', fake it - test whether the mouse is over the opengl view and if so behave properly, otherwise 'do something else' - right now, nothing.  It may even be possible to maintain a state variable - 'if clicked inside of geometry view isn't set, don't send bindings, if clicked in geometry view is set do opengl action' - ugly but it has potential and may be robust. TODO:  This approch might potentially be used to provide a real workaround for the Mac Input Bug in MGED as well.
