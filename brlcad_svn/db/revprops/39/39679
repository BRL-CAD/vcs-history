Alright, this isn't close to ready yet but has definitely reached the 'I don't want to have to re-create it' stage - commit initial work on some basic routines for syncing between the comb datastructure and avs attributes, with some helper functions to handle the various naming convention stuff.  These functions will be used initially to clean up the red.c logic, but will probably be needed in other places where standard attributes are changed.
