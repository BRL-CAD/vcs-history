Start roughing out a way to get isst and tk working together.  Using togl widget and gears example as a starting point - the following allows 'bwish gears.tcl' to work succesfully, and links in libtie and librender (though it doesn't do anything with them yet.  From here, convert from the gear demo code to the ISST opengl code as seen in the isst sdl based gui.
