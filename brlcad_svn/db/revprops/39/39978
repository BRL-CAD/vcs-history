partial undo of bob's  r39946.  we can't assume our libz.  instead, make it easy to pass compilation flags down from our top-level configure using our BC_WITH_FLAG_ARGS macro.  if we set LIBZ_CPPFLAGS, that means we intend to build it.  if we're using ours, we need to be sure to tell the build to look in our libz directory for the includes and libz.la file or a -lz. this seems to do the trick.
