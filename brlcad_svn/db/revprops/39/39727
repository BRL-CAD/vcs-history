checking less than 6 or greater than 7 means it allows 6 or 7 args, yet only exactly 7 is valid (and 6 crashes).  do the right check.  expand the error reporting too to say exactly which argument couldn't be read.  improve on the stupid 'Regionflag' that undocumentedly had to start with 'R' in order to make the region.  check for a boolean value too now.
