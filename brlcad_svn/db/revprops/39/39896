OK, get real on CMake + BRL-CAD - some complex logic to work out for the src/other stuff, and will need to figure out how to be smart with control options.  Start small - this lets the BRLCAD_USE_SYSTEM_LIBS directory force on the BRLCAD_USE_SYSTEM_ZLIB third part option, or at least does part of that job.  Need to figure this out - may have to write 'cache hiding' functions to hide subconfigure CMake options if turned off, assuming CMake supports such behavior...
