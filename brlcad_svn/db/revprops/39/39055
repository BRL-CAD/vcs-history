Add two of Deitz' earliest papers on GED.  Other citations reference June 1982 and October 1983 as pub dates instead of 1984 in Proceedings of the 3rd NCGA Conference (pp949-960) and Defense Computer Graphics 83 respectively.  they were apparently (re?)published as BRL reports too, which is what I cite here.
