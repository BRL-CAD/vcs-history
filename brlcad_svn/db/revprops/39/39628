tessellate_pipe_bend() was not able to handle cases where the bend radius
equals the outer radius of the pipe. The problem was that such a situation
produces degenerate faces. The fix was to add a vertex tree and a vertex
array to help in identifying and skipping the degenerate faces.
This fixes bug ID#3013742.
