stub in libicv.  initial content is actually a processing function, icv_rot(), which is a refactoring of bwrot and pixrot into one source for both.  this initial interface is a work-in-progress and was left in libged-style argc/argv style as a mere step forward on refactoring the util dir tools.  still a lot to be sorted out.
