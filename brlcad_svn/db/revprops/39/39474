Östen Lundahl reported a bug in sf bug report 2990066 (heap corrupted when making sketch with nurb segment) which he proceeded to isolate and provide a fix for in sf bug 3007466 (Sketch nurb curves bug found).  the original bug report behavior couldn't be replicated but seeing the fix in question, the bug became quite an apparent off-by-one memory allocation error.

Quite an obscure bug to isolate, kudos and thanks to Östen.
