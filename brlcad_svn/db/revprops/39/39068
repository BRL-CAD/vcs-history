bob and I fixed the opengl framebuffer refresh bug.  bob identified where double buffering was getting disabled, I applied a fix that made double or single-buffering refresh properly.  bob made a nice estimated 25% performance improvement to the blit time on the ogl interface as well by packing pixels as BGRA instead of ABGR.  still slow as balls but it's better.
