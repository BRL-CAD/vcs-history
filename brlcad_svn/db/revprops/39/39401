keith found an interesting background pixel difference comparing a BoT raytrace with a NURBS ray trace.  The background pixels on the BoT image were off slightly by one for a large portion of scanlines (in the lower portion of the image).  entire scanline was affected, but only the background pixels were off slightly, iirc.
