add a fudge factor of 6 degrees to compensate for the fact that we're translating the segments based on their lower corner point instead of their natural center.  the x/y needs to change and/or the rotation angle needs to take the size and keypoint of the box into consideration.  fudge is 'good enough' for this scripting example, though.

we also batch together mged invocations in sets of 100 to reduce overhead.  improves runtime by two orders of magnitude.  names are simplified as well.
