fix a bug on Mac where TextEdit blathers warnings about being unable to register itself with system services.  this is due to running multiple instances of TextEdit and while the warning is benign, we quell it (via closing stdin AND stderr for the forked child) as it's not useful to the user.  add a few more sanity checks in along with keeping track of our (null) options with the ugly argv-in-an-argv hack.  make the Invoking statement more generally diagnostic and useful
END
