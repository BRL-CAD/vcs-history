john anderson fixed crashes of codes calling into pipe tessellation (e.g. ev command in mged) where a pipe with a bend radius set to exactly one-half of the outside diameter causes a problem.  john said that tessellate_pipe_bend() was not able to handle cases where the bend radius equates the outer radius of the pipe because it would cause degenerate faces to be generated.The fix was to add a vertex tree and a vertex array to help in identifying and skiping the degenerate faces.  fix addresses sf bug report 3013742 from gilliganu (pipe with min bend radius crashes mged)
