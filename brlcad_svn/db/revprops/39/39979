add a FIXME.  mk_nmg() and mk_nmg_from_bot() both call wdb_export() which clearly documents that it will free the data passed to it.  So in order to protect the parent caller, these routines need to make a copy of the data or wdb_export() needs to have a parameter for specifying what to do with the memory (probably ideal since nmg data can be huge).
