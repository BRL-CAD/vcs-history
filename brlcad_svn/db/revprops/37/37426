make db_walk_tree()'s struct db_full_path pointer be const since no caller should really need to be modifying it (and for the few that were temporarily modifying it, make them get a copy).  this cascades a const through to all of the db_walk_tree() callbacks for region start, region end, and the leaf function, but it's a minor api change.  oof.
