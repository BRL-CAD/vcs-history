Getting set up to move the MGED commands to mann with a .nged prefix.  As a first step, move those reported to have conflicts by gentoo, but all MGED commands will need to be moved.  brlman script also needed a minor tweak to handle manpage extensions that weren't an exact match for the man* character in the directory name.  Not clear yet if it can handle specifying 1 vs. 3 vs. n man pages, but for commands like rt it will eventually need to - look into it.
