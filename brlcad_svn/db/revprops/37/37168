make things a little more robust on the number parsing.  don't just assume a one-character separator and then the start of another number.  skip any trailing whitespace before and after a separator taking care to allow space itself to simply be a separator so these should work: '12,23,34', '12, 23, 34', '12 ,23 , 34', '12 23 34', '12/23/34', etc.
