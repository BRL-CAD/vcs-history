do frame was only checking if there were primitives prepped, but not whether there were any valid regions remaining to render (which there should always be as even all regionless objects (even primitives) are promoted to regions).  make it check and halt if there aren't any so that we don't dispatch all rays only to have prep and do_run do nothing useful.
