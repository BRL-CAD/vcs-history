define __REG_NOCHAR so that we don't declare the old char regex functions.  we're getting conflicting types on re_comp() and re_exec() on bsd systems.  we don't use those functions though (nobody should really), so it should be safe to leave undeclared.  really just needed the 'FRONT' regex function declarations.
