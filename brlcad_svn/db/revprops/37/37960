apply a variety of mods to make the header work on 10.4 32-bit ppc mac (gcc 4.0.0) including fixing some invalid preprocessor concatenation, and protecting the header if it's included before/after the system stdint.h (so we don't get type conflicts).  reordered from low to high so that the smalled fitting matches first.
