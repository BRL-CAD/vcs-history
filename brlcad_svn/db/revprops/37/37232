Added very basic calls to impliment the heat-graph. This will be lightmodel 8, and will
eventually determine how much time was spent calculating each pixel during a raytrace.
After the initial raytrace is completed, the picture will be replaced with a graphical 
representation of how long each pixel took in regards to the entire picture, where
short times are charactarized as one color, and transition to another color
representing a longer time.

However, now it just changes the background to white.
