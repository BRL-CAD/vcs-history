Properly initialized timeTable with '-1' when first created. This however causes
program to die when more than 1 processor works on it. (Adding semaphores made program
hang).
Fixed pointers returned from timeTable_init to allow them to work correctly.
Inverted test Image now renders with 1 processor, as opposed to having a bus error.
