if we're asked to prep an rtip with nothing in it, we're done prepping that rtip.  set needprep to false so code elsewhere doesn't keep recalling prep spewing 'no (primitives|regions) left to prep' messages.  this is related to sf bug report 2927515 (a particular arb5 fails to raytrace) from John Dalton (john-dalton), quelling the spewing of 'endless' error messages.
