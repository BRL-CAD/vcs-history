Add a file describing what changes have been made from vanilla openNURBS and why - intent is to make the merger of the next release (whenever that happens) easier.  Start from this revision and the contents of this file - will need to evaluate all the changes documented here in any new version to see if they a) no longer apply b) have been incorporated or c) are no longer needed.  Then start from this revision and evaluate any further revisions.
END
