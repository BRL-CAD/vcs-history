we need a different solution, these defines can't just be conditional or the compile is broken (the API is missing) for non-uint32_t systems.  common.h needs to guarantee that the c99 types are provided so they can be used unconditionally.  not quite sure how that's not happening now even for non-BRLCADBUILD systems, so can't try a fix.  at worse, we can provide our own stdint.h for systems missing the types.
