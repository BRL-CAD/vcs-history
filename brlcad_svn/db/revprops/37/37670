remove all of the rt_comb_*() functions out of tcl and back over with other comb routines in db5_comb.c and db_tree.c; begin rewriting db_tcl_tree_describe() as db_tree_list() with the implementation NOT using a Tcl_DString.  basic mirrored support for beginnging and ending a list scope are implemented along with a matching routine to determine if a space needs to be added.  one piece remaining, to add a new element.
