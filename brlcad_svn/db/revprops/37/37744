Ah hah.  Coil tool problem with -S inputs was due to the introduction of the left hand winding ability - that ability requires a variable be set that wasn't being set by the five inputs to -S, so make it 6 settings - the -S option really should be rethought, since you can't currently mix left and right hand windings, but at least it will work now.
