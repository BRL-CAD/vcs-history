finally quiet the warning about curtree possibly getting clobbered due to a longjmp.  We make a copy of the curtree and free the original so that we can play with our copy more carefreefully.  this lets strict pass on erik's teardropmaxbox that was curiously unreproducible on an identical configuration elsewhere.  no matter, it seemeth fixed now.
