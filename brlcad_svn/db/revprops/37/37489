only look for source files in the  src and include directories (so we avoid walking down distcheck dirs and potentially other unknown locations), but even more so, make sure it's a BRL-CAD file before we boldly claim it has a common.h problem.  look at the file header to make sure, which helps it skip the lexer generated source files too (which will otherwise fail the common.h test as the lexer adds it's own stuff to the top of the generated file).
