note a few of bob's last-minute injections.  he added a dbot command to archer for dumping any BoTs that are displayed as well as a means to export the current view as OBJ data (displayed geometry plus annotations).  dbot will likely get merged into the bot_dump command (which will likely merge with the bot command or some generalized dump command).
