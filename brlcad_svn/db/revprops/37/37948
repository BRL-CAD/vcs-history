move the stdint provisions out of our win32-specific private header into common.h so that the stdint types can be guaranteed.  the guarantee is necessary if we're to utilize stdint types in our public API (which we're now doing).  for now, bundle all of the stdint types together, included with the assumptions for detecting uintptr_t .. at least until it's obvious that a better solution is needed.  the defines may very well need some adjustments to work as a public header without resorting to platform defines.
