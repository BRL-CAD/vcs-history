wow, OLD OLD bug here.  bu_vls_prepend wasn't incrementing the book-keeping size of the vls after appending something.  this resulted in chars getting nibbled off the end until eventually an overflow is encountered.  curiously, we weren't even using this function before r37413 change to edcodes (at least not any more).
