okay, so the root solver is SUPER sensitive to these two changes.  one is an exact floating point comparison being made, the other was a tolerance tightened up from a value set loose in the mid-80's for irix2. this fixes the eto ray-tracing failures caught by the solids.sh regression test.  the SQRT_SMALL_FASTF change notably seems to mostly cause subtle off-by-one changes which might be tolerable but will need more investigation.
