add a new regression test to test BoT functionality.  more specifically, see if the various oriented and unoriented volume mode bots all work as expected.  tests various bot commands such as facetize, bot_flip, bot_merge, bot_sync, bot_vertex_fuse, bot_face_fuse.  still WIP.  next need to make sure they all render identical.
