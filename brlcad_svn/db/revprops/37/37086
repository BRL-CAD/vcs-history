remove nmg_eu_radial_check() since it was commented out and the uncommented version had not easily resolvable constness problems (it needed a non-const copy of it's edgeuse to pass to nmg_radial_build_list() yet that list then becomes disassociated with its eu if it is copied).  also a few exact floating point comparisons changed.
