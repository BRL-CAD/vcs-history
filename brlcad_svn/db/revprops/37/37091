getting a handle on this one took some unexpected concentration.  reworked the logic slightly to avoid the goto jump that was being used to restart the edge testing.  it's actually simple enough to let it fall through if we just make sure we let it keep track of the edge table correctly (removing our edge before testing verts, not after).  add comments as to what's going on.
