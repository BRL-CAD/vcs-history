less emphasis on the statement to submit results, instead call attention to the email address.  improve the output reporting of sysctl (don't need vm) and the way results are formatted.  include prtdiag for solaris.  use look_for to search the PATH to keep failures quiet (and avoid having to run the binary additional times)
