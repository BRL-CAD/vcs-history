OOF.. even hard for me to edit a file with a 1978 start date (damn), so keep that note but still remove authorship.  that's a case in point why it's a problem, though.  again, the reason is NOT to diminish or hide the noteworthy contributions of those authors but, rather, to manage authorship information in the project documentation (e.g., the AUTHORS file) and revision control system.  it's also been shown among various open source projects that files with notable authors or significant legacy are often edited with great hestiation or outright avoided, particularly by new (less experienced) open source developers.  there's also a muddled issue of misleading credit, authorship preservation after significant changes or refactoring, and the magnitude of changes that warrant credit.  the solution is usually a duplication of information already contained within the revision control system logs, which is wasteful and can heavily distract from the file's primary purpose.  no code is without reproach or deficiencies, so we relegate authorship to documentation and revision control to help encourage change.
