restructure the output so that system configuration information is included at the end of the log instead of the beginning.  that also lets us preserve the sysctl formatting and include the verbose /proc/cpuinfo details if they are available.  we do this quietly only because it's so much output, but still let the user know that additional information was added to the log.
