get the pointer value as a long integer before doing the comparisons.  this will allow calls to BU_CKMAG for address of structs on the stack to not produce a compilation warning about the address always evaluating to true.  going indirectly through the value does make the magic check potentially a little more expensive for non-optimized non-production builds.
