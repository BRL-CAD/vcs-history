tkhtml subconfigure test - it's unlikely this is correct, but somewhat surprisingly it built and installed on a Gentoo Linux box, so since we're past the 7.16.4 tag stick it in to give it a try on a few other systems - maybe it can be polished up.  Constitutes a minimal set of changes to try to get the original configure.in and Makefile.in files to act like configure.ac and Makefile.am files, so they don't look much like other configure.ac and Makefile.am setups in BRL-CAD.
