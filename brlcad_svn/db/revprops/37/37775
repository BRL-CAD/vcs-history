size_t will not necessarily be big enough to hold a pointer address.  on current uniform memory hardware, that's certainly a reasonable assumption, but not necessarily with 16-bit systems and not with fragmented/partitioned memory systems.  instead, use the c99-optional-but-we-provide-it-regardless uintptr_t type which is specifically for holding a pointer address value.
