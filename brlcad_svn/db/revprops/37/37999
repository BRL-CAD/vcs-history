restructure to avoid forward declarations.  fix bug introduced with the removal of the 'unnecessary' _ged_tmpcomb_init global.. which was a hack to reinit a global being used to temporarily stash a name.  instead rework the functions that were using it to pass the new name around instead of relying on the global.
