the test intentionally didn't include tcl or itcl headers.  the incrTcl test was intentionally just testing itcl suitability, if a distro separates the two, that sounds like their issue (as incrTcl certainly doesn't do that and our configure testing reflects them).  we can/should also test for itk so we can at least report a failure if not installed.
