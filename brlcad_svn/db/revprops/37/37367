Added semaphore to timeTable_init to prevent multi-access to the timetable before it's
made. Changed timeTable_init's parameter to be FBIO *fbp so that way it may access the 
framebuffer size directly, instead of relying on a global variable. Program now 'works'
with multiprocessor support, most of the time, however output is erroneous. Single processor
heat-graph is still unchanged.
