Hack and slash the PNG support in Tk, which depends on the Zlib stuff removed from Tcl earlier.  It appears that the Tcl/Tk solution to the problem we encountered earlier integrating tkpng was to also integrate zlib into Tcl, which means that Tcl itself is now going to conflict with our libz.  Earlier compiler errors indicate that libtcl isn't going to be a suitable straight up linking replacement, so there's a situation here.  Hopefully it can function enough for the AquaTk tests we need to run here, but it's not going to be an ignorable issue forever and probably will require Makefile.am hackery in tcl (at a minimum) to use BRL-CAD's libz.
