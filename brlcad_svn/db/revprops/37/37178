rt now reports prep failures a little more clearly, in part by aborting earlier, so as to not spew a prep failure per ray when rt is invoked from within mged.  this is in response to sf bug report 2927515 (a particular arb5 fails to raytrace) from John Dalton (john-dalton), quelling the spewing of 'endless' error messages.
