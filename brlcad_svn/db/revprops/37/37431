this one is a biggie.  keith applied a fix to the BoT ray tracing code so that we no longer have a solidity failure when grazing a surface edge.  using a FILO in/out collapse, multiple ins are collapsed to the first in, and multiple outs to the last out, making grazing points be considered a full hit.  this should fix a bug documented in sf bug 1501921 (Missed volume when raytracing BOTs) reported by Charles Kennedy (g2asc) and Tim Myers where a BoT with stair-step features was causing rays to slip through the mesh if they were perfectly aligned on an edge.  this will need additional testing, particularly to see if the FILO approach is 'too much' or if other results are affected.  if that's the case, a more cumbersome LIFO approach could be taken provided the bot shot() routine is modified appropriately to check neighbors when grazing an edge.
