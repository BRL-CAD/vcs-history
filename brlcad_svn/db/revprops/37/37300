Added two more functions to view in relation to the heat-graph. The first, 
timetable_input is a reworked timetable_init that focuses only on inputting
values into the timetable array. Timetable_init has been reworked to only
initialize the timetable array. The second, is timetable_process, which will
do the normalization and placing pixels into the file buffer.
