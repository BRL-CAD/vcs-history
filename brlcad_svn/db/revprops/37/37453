Fixed behavior of commands that invoke an external editor - libged migration of logic resulted in some of the special case logic for editors needing a controlling terminal being lost.  Now MGED generates the required information and sends it to the libged routine that invokes the editor - in essence, MGED now tells libged how it wants the editor invoked.
