odd exact floating point comparison here that dates back to 1986.  the intent looks like a simple comparison of b-diff == b being that the diff is simply so near zero that it's below computation tolerance to represent, which is SMALL_FASTF.  additionally the magic 1.0e-5 that was added for SGI is tightened up to SQRT_SMALL_FASTF.  obviously needs testing.
