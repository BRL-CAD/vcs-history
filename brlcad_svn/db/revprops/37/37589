Removed "noinst" library build and reverted back to linking in objects directly. 'step-g' uses initialization of static class variables to self register AP203 classes to an object factory without the need to list every new class in an explicit registration routine. Linking across a static library was causing objects to be dropped if they weren't somehow referenced from "main" and therefore wouldn't get initialized. Shared libraries work better in this regard and will go that route when needed by other Apps.
