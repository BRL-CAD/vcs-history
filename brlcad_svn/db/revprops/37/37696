add support for parsing files with a 'o' object name.  blender uses 'o' instead of 'g' for the object name, others probably do too.  also, make all unrecognized lines simply get ignored (non-fatally) so that it won't just halt on something unexpected.  also, unroll a few lines; someone's editor apparently can't handle 256 lines in a file or something.
