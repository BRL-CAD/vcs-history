erik pinpointed the routine, so looking through recent logs it's clear that vls printing was damaged by automatic comma formatting where a space was injected.  undo the space injection (even though struct parsing shouldn't be significant or so sensitive to a whitespace change like that).  this should hopefully fix some of the volumetric objects (like ebm in solids.sh in regression suite).
