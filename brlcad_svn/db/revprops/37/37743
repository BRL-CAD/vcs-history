begin the conversion of the undocumented 'i' chaining structparse keyword to a '%p' pointer argument.  the idea being that the tables are linked together via the pointer address of the other table.  still a pending concept so don't get all annoying with deprecation notices just yet (not that they're strictly required either as 'i' wasn't publicly documented behavior).
