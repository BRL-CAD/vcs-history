Kaboooom.  massive consistency/formatting/ws/indent/comment/deadcode clean-up.  should be absolutely no logic changes introduced, but when you changes 15k lines of code.. damn if I'd swear to it.  inadvertent spacing after commas is the likely problem case though no further suspects were identified after fixing more than 50 such errors.  this cleanup took a long time (better part of a day) but cleans up the entire mged dir with improved readability, maintainability, and format consistency.
