Update to version 200909255 - opennurbs V5 first release.  Have attempted to merge in all related fixes from previous BRL-CAD openNURBS version, but this merge deliberately removes special purpose code used in earlier attemps at NURBS raytracing.  Some of this code is still used and will reappear in opennurbs_ext.cpp and opennurbs_ext.h - ideally all changes now present in src/other/openNURBS will be related to compiler specific issues, using external zlib, or genuine logical changes (not simply additions) to openNURBS. (An example of the latter is the xtol and ytol changes in opennurbs_brep.cpp)
