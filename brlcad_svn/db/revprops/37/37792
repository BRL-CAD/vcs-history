Add rudamentary work to support specification of length.  Extremely crude, supports only one type of coil and fits to length without attempting to preserve other user specified characteristics when some are specified and some are not.  What this needs is a priority queue of some sort that preferentially sorts non-user-specified parameters to the head of the list of knobs to try, and perhaps tries to maintain some sort of relationship between various sizes - interesting but at  least slightly non-trivial to do right.
