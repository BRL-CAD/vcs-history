fix gqa crash on 64-bit linux where strsep() is not defined (due to strict compilation, it's a bsd extension).  the 32-bit int return value getting cast to a 64-bit pointer was badness.  instead rewrite the units parsing to use strtok() since it's c89, also taking the opportunity to get rid of the unnecessary goto logic.  while we're at it, take care of fstat/fileno warnings along with a strdup() -> bu_strdup() fix.
