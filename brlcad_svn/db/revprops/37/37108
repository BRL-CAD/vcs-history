modify the spatial position traversal to do what the comment says, progressing the smallest amount possible.  we progress by SQRT_SMALL_FASTF (1e-39/1e-18) instead of the hardware tol SMALL_FASTF (1e-77/1e-37) so as to be 'slightly' closer to what we were stepping (1e-14). obviously needs testing..
