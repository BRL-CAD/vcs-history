mapping file support was added to the mvall commands, so remove the todo option.  the idea to also add it to the 'mv' command is interesting, but not nearly as pressing a need to keep the entry around for.  instead of adding similar -f options to other commands, a generic batch file command would be better as it'd parallel the search command.  it'd also be generalizable to arbitrary automatic file-based processing.
