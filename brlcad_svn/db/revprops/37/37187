complete overhaul of the 'garbage_collect' command.  rewrite the command to take a lot more care to not accidentally destroy the users data if something unexpected happens.  instead of copying over the current database, use the working keep file as a testing copy and just rename files around as they are processed and verified.  add more verification checks to make sure the view is restored, objects are saved, and that processing failures won't leave the user in an unrecoverable state.  fixed a bug where the title had a character getting nibbled off, also correctly handles a db that is completely emptied out, also now restores the view orientation.  add help options and require the user actively initiate the action with a -c|-confirm argument.
END
