Take a stab at breaking the density buffer parsing out of gqa into libanalyze.  Currently, rtweight will not handle things like comments in .density files, since those improvements were specific to gqa.  Need a shared, generic routine - not totally sure yet if file/database sourcing functions should also be in libanalyze, so for the moment move just the parsing logic.  Next step will be to get rtweight to use this style of density information parsing and storage.
