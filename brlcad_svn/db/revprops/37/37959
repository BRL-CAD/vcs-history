include paul hsieh's pstdint.h header file from http://www.azillionmonkeys.com/qed/pstdint.h as a means to supply stdint types for platforms (like windows) that do not supply it.  using paul's instead of our own fellow doug gwyn's work (available at http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/q8/index.html) due to it's relative simplicity to integrate.
