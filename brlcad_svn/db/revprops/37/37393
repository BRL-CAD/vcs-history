clear up the exact floating point comparison by converting it to a NEAR_ZERO test, but keep the 1.0e-5 magic number on the subsequent test.  still need to figure out why it's so sensitive for the eto, but this takes care of the comparison warning.  while we're in here, (re-)increase the number of root solver iterations to 100 from 20 to give the solver more of a fighting chance if it is stuck in a linear search.
