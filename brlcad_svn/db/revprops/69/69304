Try out a trick for consolidating most of the libbu unit test binaries into one - should eliminate about 20 build targets, if it works.  The idea is to leave each individual C file as-is and rename main, to allow for easy switching back to a different approach if this doesn't work out (and/or allow for easy stand-alone testing if needed.)
