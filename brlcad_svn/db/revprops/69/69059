bit again.  remove dead symlinks so removed/renamed files don't mess with the build (e.g., when a tclIndex needs to be regenerated).  if it globs but doesn't exist, it's a dead link and useless in the build tree regardless.  copies are left to fend for themselves (and don't exhibit the same problems).
