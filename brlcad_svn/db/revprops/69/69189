encountered another crash in the ars code, attempting to print a tri_specific.  turns out, the st_specific is set to a bot_specific now, so all of the tri_specific callbacks are moot, many unused.  kill em.  move rt_hitsort while we're at it to an internal function since it was primitive-specific api (despite the name, it lived up in the ars code and is used by several primitives.)  now it's part of primitive_util.
