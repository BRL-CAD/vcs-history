quell what looks like a false positive from clang static analysis.  complains that maxDot isn't read, even though it's used repeatedly for test+setting flag.  what's unclear is whether maxDot should be reset every loop iteration as it was doing, or only once before entering the loop.  this retains the previous behavior.
