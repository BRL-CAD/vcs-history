implement a better solution to the array overrun false positive when eliminating side cylinder hits beyond the end.  also wasn't correctly yanking the second point with the new iteration, fixed with this new approach.  we tally up a skip list and do just one copy (potentially) instead of nlog(n) copies.  also fixed npts <0 when reporting convergence failures (zero isn't a failure).  inadvertently includes other cleanup too.
