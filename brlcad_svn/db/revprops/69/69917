Correct the unit setting for parts.  We were setting the part units locally, but unfortunately that was conflicting with Creo's notion of using matrix adjustments further up the hierarchies to do the corrections.  Probably should figure out how to recognize when we're converting parts in isolation (where corrective matricies won't be available) but for now do what looks like the right thing for hierarchy conversion.  Also, be much more stingy about when we use the FAIL reporting case.
