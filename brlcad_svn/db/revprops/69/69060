Normally this isn't a good idea, but given how embedded rt_in_rpp is in the core shotlining logic we break the nmg/librt coupling here by making an nmg version of this function to minimize any unintended side effects of things like the previous attempt to move rt_in_rpp to libbg.  Once libnmg is a separate library we can revisit this, but for now go with the least risk minimal impact solution.
