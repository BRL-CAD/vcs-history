First successful geometry generation, although the brlcad_names memory freeing issue in particular needs to be addressed.  Probably need to turn off other dialog activations, but I can't disable *all* of them or I get no dialog - more testing is indicated.  Also need to confirm units are right, and check other API updates/changes.
