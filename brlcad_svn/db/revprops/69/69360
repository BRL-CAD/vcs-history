Add all the updated Pro/E plugin code back in, with minor tweaks.  This code, with the present build logic and the BRL-CAD dlls where CREO can find them, loads successfully.  Conversion is untested, and probably not working yet - some of the original Pro/Develop APIs were switched out with Pro/Toolkit replacements.
