revise handling of member transformations for motion states; add a btIDebugDraw interface for output to brlcad databases; dynamically select ray grid tolerances (Bullet distance tolerances and physics step parameters should also be tuned); update the database at each btMotionState change, and create an rt_i at each iteration for each pair of primitives used in the collision algorithm
