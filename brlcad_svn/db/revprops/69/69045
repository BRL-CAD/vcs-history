Victor found a problem with attr show.  There was unsigned math going on in the tab calculations for displaying selected attributes, and a long attribute value length resulted in an attempt to assign a negative value to the unsigned tab length.  The result was the vls logic trying work with the resulting garbage value and effectively hanging (may not technically have been an infinite loop, but looks that way to a user and it will eventually wipe out in some other way if it ever did move on.)  Rather than do all the special case foo, teach attr_print to handle either printing everything or printing an argv list of attributes.  Consolidates the logic and eliminates the problem case.
