Document xpush bug fix. The corrected bug may have also been responsible for the reported error of extra objects getting killed leaving dangling references, but someone has to dig up a model that showed this issue and test it to be sure (see r33579 commit message). But since the r69256 bug caused traversal of the directory free-list, it's possible that garbage data in some items caused additional directories to be deleted. This explanation depends on unlucky state in the free-list. Specifically, reading the garbage dp member of the garbage (struct object_use) d_use_hd member would have to produce a valid directory address. It's probably more likely that it would be a bogus address triggering a crash, an issue Cliff addressed in r49524 when he switched the free-list allocation to use calloc; a change that might have to be reverted to reproduce the dangling reference issue.
