The problem was actually with _db_comb_get_children.  Because the array was built backwards, a failed db_lookup was adding a terminating RT_DIR_NULL earlier in the array.  Number of leaves is not the same as number of valid leaves.  Check ahead of time and handle the invalid case so we get what is expected.
