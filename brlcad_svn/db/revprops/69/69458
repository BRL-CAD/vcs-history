Autodraw one selected path at a time. Add a progress bar and command status text to show draw progress, and a cancel button that stops the issuing of new draw commands. For multiple path selection, delay start of drawing to facilitate cancellation. Implement checker destructor to ensure closing the checker window during cancellable draw operations doesn't cause any errors.
