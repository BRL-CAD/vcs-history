src/libdm/dm-wgl.c:2386 has the wgl display manager's getDisplayImage function set to the null function - i.e. it won't return any data - but the screengrab.c code doesn't seem to allow for the possibility of ged_dm_get_display not returning anything.  Check for a null idata after the call - untested, but this may avoid the screengrab crash reported on Windows (won't actually get it working either, however...)
