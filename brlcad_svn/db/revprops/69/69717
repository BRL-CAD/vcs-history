make tgc use the same tolerance as the root solver, meaning it will be more generous about discarding imaginary roots.  this fixes a problem with 'pinched' tgc where the solver is returning duplicate roots at imaginary +- 3e-3.  testing passes, but if this proves to be problematic, an alternative will be to check for los=0 on the real component pairs.
