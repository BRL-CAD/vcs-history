setting a nul char isn't right, almost certainly masking a real bug that was caught.  bu_vls_putc() and other vls printing functions already manually nul-terminate and bu_vls_cstr() is defined to guarantee only returning a nul-terminated string.  so any vls string lacking 0-termination would be a bug.
