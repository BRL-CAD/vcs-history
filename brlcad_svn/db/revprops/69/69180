Enough.  Implement a librt function call to return the set of directory objects that are the immediate children of a comb.  I've been using a db_search call to work around the lack of this function, but that makes no sense when one of the possible places for using this information is db_search (and really a search setup/teardown is a lot of overhead for this anyway.)
