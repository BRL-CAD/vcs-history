nestling multiple actions onto one line is discouraged for exactly the reason clang (fortunately) warned about, plus readability and maintainability, but best practice is to do only one thing per line.  then it becomes syntactically nonsense to mix up assignment with comparison and it's (more) clear what each line does.
