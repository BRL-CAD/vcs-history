latest clang notices that there's no check on the number of roots being returned, so we conceivably will exceed the array subscript bounds on the hit_type[j] = hit_type[j+1] circa line 845 if the root solver goes nuts.  we know tgc's equation should return <= 4 roots, but nothing code-wise required it before now.  build failure reported by GCI participant AntonL (task instance 6571976497823744).
