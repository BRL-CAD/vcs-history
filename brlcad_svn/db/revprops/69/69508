fix bug printing %V structparse entries and arrays of %s where a space is needed before the key=value.  noticed on g2asc of a dsp, which fortunately was on the 'name' field which is duplicated by the 'file' field -- so there may not be calling code that hits this bug in a bad way.  basically needs a structparse where %V is in the middle of the table to hit the case.
