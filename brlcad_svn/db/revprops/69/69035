patch https://sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/patches/448/ "Zippering gaps" from Rakshika Bagavathy
implements the heal command for BoTs on mged: heal <bot primitive> <tolerance>
the heal command has still issues and should be considered for testing purposes only, however, it should not interfere with the other BRL-CAD functionality, i.e. it should be safe to commit the patch
END
