Consolidate the child logic into a single function - for these purposes, it doesn't matter whether the 'children' are from a comb or one of the primitives that reference other objects.  Simplifys the main loop.  Primitive specific logic other than comb untested, but trying a similar trick to get the child name with a minimal cracking of the extern.
