bug has probably been in here since the beginning, was setting HAVE_HAVE_AVAILABILITYMACROS_H and not checking a couple other headers.  change the funcs to just take the var we want to have set (helps when searching for it) instead of appeanding HAVE_ automatically.  avoids potential inconsistencies down the road too.
