Fairly massive refactoring and rework of the BRL-CAD exec and lib target management system.  Enable position independent code, and (on systems where we can do so) use OBJECT libraries to build both the static and shared versions of a library.  This should save build time and re-introduces a capability lost in the autotools->cmake migration, but is also intended to set the stage for the recreation of the 'libbrlcad' agglomeration library targets.  Need to make sure enabling the position independent code isn't a problem, and needs fairly extensive testing (MSVC is untested as of this commit.)  This should also significantly simplify the build target management logic - used functions instead of macros, tried to reduce duplication of logic and streamline where possible.  The non-OBJECT build behavior is also available (and should be defaulted to on MSVC) by setting the USE_OBJECT_LIBS option to OFF.
