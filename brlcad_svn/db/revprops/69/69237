Go ahead and check in the commented out test code comparing the two means of getting children of a comb in case we need to try this again later.  This special purpose version, although fast, can not replace the comb internal tree walking version since routines processing the internal form assume the comb is already fully cracked and populated in standard memory structures.  This general approach could be highly instructive when it comes to optimizing the db_search logic however, since that operates at the directory pointer level.  Worth thinking about.
