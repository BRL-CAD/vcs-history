If we build our own libpng but try to use the system freetype/fontconfig for Tk, we're ending up with a conflict.  Skip using freetype with Tk when we build libpng - this is the only safe move until we can provide a managed fontconfig along with freetype to avoid sucking in the system libpng inadvertently.
