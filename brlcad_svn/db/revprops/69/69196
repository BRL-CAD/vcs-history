If we find out ahead of time what the largest bu_external ext_buf size is, we can allocate one bu_external with that large buffer size and re-use that same external object for *all* db get operations.  Cuts about half a second off of the execution time for a large db5_size calculation test, although we end up in effect creating local versions of several of the db_io functions that take a user supplied bu_external buffer object.
