Make brlcad_ident.h into a template, and avoid updating brlcad_config.h unless we need to.  This drastically trims back the rebuilding after a configure - limits it to things that care about the brlcad_ident versioning.  Still get relinking and rebuilding of .g models and tclscripts, but much better.
