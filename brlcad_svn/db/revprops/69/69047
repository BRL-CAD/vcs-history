less API is better.  consolidate all 7 BU_ASSERT*() macros into just one BU_ASSERT().  the others existed so we could pretty-print their values, but this is not incredibly helpful when we're tearing down the application as a result.  with bu_bomb giving a stack trace, the values may end up logged anyways.  this converts BU_ASSERT_PTR, BU_ASSERT_LONG, BU_ASSERT_SIZE_T, BU_ASSERT_SSIZE_T, and BU_ASSERT_DOUBLE calls to BU_ASSERT.
