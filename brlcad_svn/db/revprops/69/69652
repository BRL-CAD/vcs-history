quell an incorrect warning being issued by gcc 6.2.1 (possibly going back as far as gcc 4.8.0), hopefully in a way that doesn't trigger a dead code warning by any other tools (e.g., coverity).  the issue (reported as GCC Bug 80406 - 'Reduced false positive test case for -Warray-bounds with -O3') seems to be the optimizer taking bounds information away from the warning system, causing it to think there's a way to exceed k[] and hit_type[] bounds even though that should be logically possible (even if we assume the root solver misbehaves horribly).
