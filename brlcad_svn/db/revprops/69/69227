Rather than introduce lots of additional info into the directory struct, see if we can get away with just a u_data pointer on which to hang our hat.  This is a double edged sword - we don't save information from earlier work on the .g to speed up subsequent actions, but we also don't encode state into the directory pointer that can be (potentially) invalidated by edits to other objects.  See if this can be made 'fast enough.'
