Punting slightly by making the nmg and rt versions of structs castable, but this technically breaks the dependency of nmg_rt_isect on rt/nmg.h.  More extensive rework to make nmg properly independent of the form of the librt structs will probably involve narrowing the scope of nmg_rt_isect to returning an ordered list of hit points - need to study what the actual requirements of nmg_class are. That logic untangling and rework looks like it will be a singificant effort in its own right; in the meantime this should serve the immediate purpose.
