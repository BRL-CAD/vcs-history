Create an independent libnmg, moving the relevant logic out of librt.  This is the culmination of the series of refactorings that have been taking place in librt.  This should be reverted if it looks like it will cause any problems at all with 7.26.2 - I'm mostly committing it at this time to more easily test on multiple platforms.
