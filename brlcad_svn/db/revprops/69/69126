Untested as yet, but attempt to disable a too aggressive check by MSVC that prevents close operations from working on already closed files.  The cleanup function in libbu is *designed* to ensure that temp files are closed, and as a consequence is very likely to be doing redundant close operations if the users already cleaned up.  Approach identifed by Sean.
