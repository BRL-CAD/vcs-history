See if we can DRY out the RPATH CMake logic a bit.  Rather than stashing multiple copies of the file in src/other, conditionalize their inclusion.  The builds won't function stand-alone without copying in the RPath_Setup.cmake file locally, but that should be all that is needed to restore an independent subbuild if it is needed and in the meantime the common case (build as subbuild of BRL-CAD) will work without our having to continuously copy the RPath_Setup.cmake file around.  Stale RPATH logic in src/other bit us for the Mac OSX build this last release, so restructuring this way in order to minimize risks of a repeat problem in the future.  Eventually, need to do this or something like it for other common bits of CMake logic as well.
