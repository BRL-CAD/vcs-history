set MODULE_SCOPE.... also, add support for setting TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG=1 mimicing the essential tcl.m4 bits while assuming long long (since we do).  with this, there are no longer defines missing when compared with the autotools tcl build except for HAVE_CAST_TO_UNION which is a silly bit for windows (and unnecessary).  that is, they match (superset).
