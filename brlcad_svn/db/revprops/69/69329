This doesn't do anything yet (on the contrary, it will hang CREO) but checkpointing anyway.  This does successfully compile and load as a plugin while presenting itself as a C++ file.  Going with the nmake build file for now since I haven't yet demonstrated a successful (i.e. runnable) CMake build of a plugin and I can't tell yet whether the extra flags CMake is adding are part of the problem.  Mostly I want CMake for the easy installer generation, but we'll see - it may not be worth it.  Apparently all user messages are handled via content loaded from text files, so from the get-go there will need to be some notion of data file management...
