daniel makes a good point about signals on windows.  instead of making the code specific to signals, make the api attempt to suspend interruptions (with various signals being one form of an interrupt).  on mac and windows, this might also include buffering various gui events (like the close button) that may have independent callbacks.  hide the two new bu_*_signal() routines as an implementation detail for now since it's not readily needed anywhere else and simplify matters a bit.
