Expand bu_units_conversion to support volume and mass.  The order of searching for matches is length, volume and finally mass.  Since unit names are unique across dimensions, this works for the string->conversion factor direction and no new function call is needed.  Unfortunately, it is NOT the case that conversion factors are unique to dimensions and as a consequence a general conversion factor -> string function must know if it is looking for a length, volume or mass.
