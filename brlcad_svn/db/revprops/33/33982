Begin the process of adding NIST's STEP Class Libraries code to the BRL-CAD tree.  This first commit sets up the build logic for a src/other/step subconfigure  and imports a step tree which is the original NIST STEP 3.2 release, minus some temporary files and an old file in src/cldai that causes conflicts on case insensitive filesystems.  This is not expected to be a buildable configuration - it is included to preserve the original state of the libraries in case it is needed.
