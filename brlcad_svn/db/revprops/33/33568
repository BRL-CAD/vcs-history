Add new routines to libbu for temporarily suspending signal handling via a new bu_suspend_signal() and bu_restore_signal() interface.  the previous handler is stashed and later restored.  if that signal is received while suspended, the handler is called once restored.  this can be useful for protecting critical sections.
