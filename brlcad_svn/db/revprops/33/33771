and here I thought I'd already tested and committed this fix for 7.14.0 but apparently never did.  this is a fix that makes the Primitive Editor work again without popping up an error about the switch statement having a problem.  it's a stupidity in switch that can't handle comments between the case blocks.  someone reported this but I can't find a reference to it anywhere atm.
