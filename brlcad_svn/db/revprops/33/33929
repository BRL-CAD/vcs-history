make the 'make' command use the existing view size when creating new objects by utilizing the new -R option on the draw command.  this is a change to make's behavior when there are no objects displayed since previously, it would create an object sized to the view, but then autoview to size the view out.  this would result in unexpected view changes that would get compounded if the user called make/draw/kill repeatedly.
