-Wconversion is rather useless since it's mostly for supporting non-ansi compilation where you often don't have a prototype and end up with default parameter types.  as a warning category, though, this just causes a lot of unquellable warnings where shorts are used in a prototype.  since they'd be passed as (int), they flag a warning but are completely correct as-is so remove -Wconversion
