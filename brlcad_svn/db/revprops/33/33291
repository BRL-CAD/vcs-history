add a slew of request from butler et al for a variety of productivity enhancers: 1) support to 'search' to find objects with given attribute value ranges (like numeric region ids), 2) adding a color option to all of the drawing commands, 3) having automatic history recordation, 4) exec support for 'search', 5) argument aware commands for automatic object matching
