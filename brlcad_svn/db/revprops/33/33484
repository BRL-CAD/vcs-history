the X11/StringDefs.h header is from Xt .. but it isn't clear that anything from Xt is still being used in here (and more importantly, it seems to compile just fine without this header).  remove it from the list so we don't need to check for it in configure (nor require libXt-devel as a dependency hopefully).
