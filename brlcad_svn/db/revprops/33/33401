this has come up several times in the past.  remove the 'in' command prompting for a seemingly mysterious 'k' option.  the option was for a keypoint parameter that was never utilized.  since this is technically an experimental primitive, it doesn't need to go through deprecation but it probably should still be stored in the .g since it's been around for so long.
