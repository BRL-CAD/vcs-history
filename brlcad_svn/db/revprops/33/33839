OK, better - can now delete points and get valid coils in .25 turn increments.  The tradeoff (not surprisingly in retrospect) was between number of control points and increments in which the coil can be deleted while being 'coiled'.  1/4 of a turn is a decent compromise - it may be more important to have fine control when defining end sections.  Also, number of turns is now accurately modeled.
