Update STEP code to version from http://www.statik.tu-cottbus.de/fileadmin/project_dth/scl/  This configuration is closer to building on many platforms but will need special options to configure not supplied by default.  As this is not the final form the libraries will take in the BRL-CAD tree no attempt is made to work with this build structure.  One more commit will be needed for a file renaming but after that point modifications will be due to BRL-CAD developers.  (Note - two files named src/fedex_plus/.pure and src/express/.Sanitize are added here that were also present in the original distribution but were missed.)
