end of cycle review, pnts import and export were finished, but still would like to get file input support working (maybe a pnts command instead of typein).  still need to do something with color and vectors for the wireframe and possibly raytracing too (big changes to support that, multi'region' primitives).  also, incrTcl once again gets the shaft (but this time not even making the next iteration due to other priorities)
END
