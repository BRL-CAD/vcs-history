bitv shifting is now 'optimized' as in no longer calculated at run-time.  since bitv_t doesn't change at compile time and works equally well for large bit vectors (actually a little faster if 'long' is a signficantly faster integer type than 'long long' even on a 64-bit platform).  that makes us ready to release if testing goes well.  still need a mega-mged test script to make sure libged integration is good.
