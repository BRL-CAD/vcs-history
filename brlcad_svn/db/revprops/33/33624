utilize CHAR_BIT from limits.h so that we can determine our shift size without relying on common.h/configure tests (since bu.h is a public header).  this makes for bit vectors constructed from much smaller 8-bit blocks, but shows no appreciable difference on performance benchmarks (x86, 32-bit mac os x 10.4, gcc4) and specific large-bot testing.  CHAR_BIT is POSIX, c99, and c90.
