bob fixed a bug in mged where the last character would end up getting ignored.  the only key combination he found that produced that behavior was a control-key-slash binding.  overriding the binding (to do nothing) fixed the issue for bob.  no word yet from peter_gillissen that reported this bug as sf bug 2555653 (Neglecting last character command-line).
