okay, so commit this since this is at least back into a compiling state.  this adds support for reading in pnts that optionally have an orientation, per-point color values, and per-point sizes.  the typein interface is slightly different from others in that it asks a handful of yes/no questions that then determines the variable number of arguments that follow.  export support is only done for two of the eight pnt types and import support is just wrong (it'll crash if you create a pnt) but it's long past time to commit something incremental so here it is.  next step is to finish export, implement import, and add support for reading from files.

END
