Add example _DENSITIES file for gqa using the data available from NIST:  http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Star/Text/contents.html  File can be expanded from other sources if there is interest, but the primary purpose is to have a convenient non-trivial example handy for gqa.  Needs to be reviewed to make sure all values are consistent with those on the site, in case of operator error on input.
