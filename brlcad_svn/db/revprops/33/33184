Continuing Architecture Work (GeometryEngine Namespace):
1) Architected GeometryManager: provides a high level interface for retrieving, caching and saving Geometry.  Considering a rename to ResourceManager since 'Geometry' no longer accurately describes ALL data types handled by GeometryManager.  
2) Architected AbstractResourceSource: a fully virtual base class that provides/mandates base functionality for performing the roles of being a read/write source of Resources.  Direct Subclasses: ResourceCache, ResourceSvnLink, ResourceDiskLink.  Subclass names provide the basic functionality for the class and thus do not need explanation.
3) Architected AbstractResource:  fully virtual base class that provides/mandates base attributes needed for a Subclass to be used by the system as a 'Resource'.  Direct Subclasses: GeoSolid, NonGeo, and GeoCollection.
4) Architected GeoCollection:  concrete base class that is equivalent to a BRL-CAD Combination.  Direct Subclasses: GeoRegion, BrlCadDBResource, DirectoryResource.  By Architecting the resource inheritance Hierarchy like this, the GeometryEngine will be able to abstract GeometryEngine storage of Resources away from the OS'es file system and the internal file system of a BRL-CAD db.  http://brlcad.org/wiki/URL_URI_URN_Implimentations for example.
5) Architected the Serializeable and Deserializable Interfaces:  Interfaces not specific to, but used by the Geometry Engine Namespace.  Any class that is to have instances of it sent over a network or saved to a binary file will need to implement these two interfaces.
