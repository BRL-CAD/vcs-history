apply a modified version of sebastian pipping's git commit 1aa97fd3387ce7a2744e9157a3ca1ea2a8f8201c (index b75fd44f0db99a60dd489cebab3b81ed4d9a55cc) that adds support to recognize the 'foreign' or 'cygnus' automake option.  the patch originally printed a hint line if all required files were missing or a custom-tailored marker message if it didn't (as well as fixing a sneaky &> that made it in earlier).  changed the patch to print a more detailed message if any file is missing (since it's still non-GNU) as well as a few more sanity checks for the Makefile.am and a minor logic reorg to be consistent with existing style. (thanks sebastian\!)
