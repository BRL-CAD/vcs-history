if we're compiling against a system 8.4, use the newly added 'compat' headers in src/other/incrTcl/compat/8.4 so that we get the proper internal/private tcl/tk headers.  this makes the entire compilation succeed using system tcl/tk with our bundled incrTcl, toggled off of the TCL_8_4_HEADERS conditional.  also makes it so we can remove that tcl+itcl sanity check section that forced our tcl/tk if not 8.5.
