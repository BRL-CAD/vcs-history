get rid of NEW_TOPS_BEHAVIOR.  let both the old and the new work for backwards-compatibility (except not in archer since wdb_obj commands are still duplications that need to die) but mark the old -g and -u flags as deprecated. verbosely complain that they are deprecated.  this fixes an unexpected behavior lee and I noticed where -u was no longer working (yet never went through deprecation/removal process).
END
