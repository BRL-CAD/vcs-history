bob fixed doing a copy action on Windows, and doing a paste for any platform.  previously, pasting would wipe out whatever was selected (which would normally make sense but not for read-only command console selections).  this addresses sf bug 2278235 reported by lbutler (Can't cut-and-paste under Windows)
