Bob added a new 'gqa' command to mged that runs the formerly command-line-only 'g_qa' command including the addition of a new -Ap option that will visualize the overlaps encountered as a series of wireframe edges similar to rtcheck.  should rename one of the two to make running the tool self-consistent inside and outside of mged.
