fix the long-standing load problems with finding itcl.tcl at runtime when we're not installed yet.  it turns out that incrTcl doesn't use the auto_path to look for its own files, it uses an init script that only checks relative to tcl_library and the ITCL_LIBRARY environment variable.  we can't use the prior, so we use the latter.
