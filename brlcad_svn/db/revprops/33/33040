This fixes a problem that showed up in make distcheck, but will also be triggered in any situation where there doesn't happen to be a correct tk.h include file installed - the list variable used by tcl.m4 already had directories in it when the time came to find the tk.h file to use, and those pre-existing paths caused a build failure on some machines (in my case, it was trying to use /usr/include/tk.h despite the enable-all flag because it 'saw' that file first.)  This may not be the 'ideal' solution - it might be better to identify the source of the pre-existing paths and why they're conflicting with tkhtml3's build setup - but for now this allows correct building of tkhtml3.
