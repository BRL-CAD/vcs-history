Problem with MGED starting up was due to errors getting returned by ged commands if a database was not open, despite this being a valid state to attempt commands.  The fix is two-fold.  First, glob.c has had its logic for checking on the state of the database moved to where it actually needs it - the regexp matching part.  Second, if the wdbp is null return OK, and do this BEFORE the database open check.  It may be that some libged commands will need to make the latter check as well - qray does in testing.
