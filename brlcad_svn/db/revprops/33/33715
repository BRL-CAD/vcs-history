One more time with regress/mged - mged.tcl can now be run successfully in an external build directory, but now requires it be passed the path of the top level source directory (same as mged.sh).  This required taking the source statements out of the .mged files, so a run_test.tcl script has been added.  In theory, this is close to the point where it can be integrated into the build system successfully, once some sort of diff logic is added.
