add a cppflags check to make sure there are not per-product cppflags being set.  this came up during the last release and several other releases causing build failures (because they're not supported prior to automake 1.7).  ignore the BREP_CPPFLAGS as a false positive since it's only presently set to AM_CPPFLAGS (which works).
