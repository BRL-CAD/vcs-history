clamp even more values to the closest corresponding integer if they're within hardware tolerance.  this change was made in response to unexpected behavior reported by a new user (tc-rucho) learning to use various view manipulation commands.  the effect of this change should be pretty pervasive to most mged commands that utilize the libbn routines for printing numbers to strings (ae being one example).
