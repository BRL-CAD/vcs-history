To solve the linking problem of ON_SSX_EVENT in Windows, and to be consistent with the newest version of openNURBS (20121024), we move the ON_SSX_EVENT implementation back to openNURBS from libbrep, and ON_Surface::IntersectSurface(), and use non-member functions declared in brep.h DumpSSXEvent() and an overload of ON_Intersect() to replace ON_SSX_EVENT::Dump() and ON_Surface::IntersectSurface().

END
