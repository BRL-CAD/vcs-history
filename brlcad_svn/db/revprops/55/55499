revert/redo r55494 because there was a reason:  the logical grouping of that data.  moreover, the commit changed the semantic of the pt field (which wasn't affiliated with the bot) data.  instead of flattening the structure, address what the clang warning was probably about -- that (if memory serves) the c++ std does not actually define anonymous structs (only anonymous unions).  fix is easy, just give it a name.
