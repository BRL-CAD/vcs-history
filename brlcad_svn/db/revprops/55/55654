so CHECK_PROTOTYPE_EXISTS() is woefully busted in numerous ways.  assumes c++, has a bad symbol test, results in unused var warnings, and doesn't work with preprocessor-wrapped symbols coming from system headers.  former versions of CHECK_SYMBOL_EXISTS() almost did exactly what we need (a simple (void)symbol; test just like AC_CHECK_DECL) but was bastardized in recent versions so it now spews an error too (it's busted and has been reported).
