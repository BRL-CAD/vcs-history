after way too many revisions and rewrites, lock in on a reasonable showcase summary for this release.  the emphasis is intentionally on archer though there are a lot of other major changes worth noting too.  plan is to highlight some of them in patch updates (e.g., affinity, lod wireframes, vol/SA calcs).
