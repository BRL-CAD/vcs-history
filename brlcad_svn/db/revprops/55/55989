Use a Tcl dict structure to pass information to rtimage, rather than a large number of parameters.  Preparing to add more rt options to rtwizard, it became clear that the old approach wouldn't scale.  This way, parameters can be added only where needed in the core rtimage script and the specific callers that want to invoke it, and the rest of the code can remain as-is.
