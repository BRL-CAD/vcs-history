Reverse merge back out the bu_ prefixing of ntohd and htond - will probably need it later, so doing it all in one commit per Sean's suggestion.  Should do this after release, and anyway a complete solution to the Windows API changes will be a lot more extensive than this - while this rename lets BRL-CAD compile with VS2012, there are runtime failures in database IO due to related Windows API changes.
