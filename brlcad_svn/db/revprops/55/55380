Walking the half-step up to 1000 iterations before bailing on the shotline was killing BREP raytrace timing. Added bail-out when the step would walk outside the current SBV. Also added half-step bail-out when the current solution already within ROOT_TOL distance of the solution. Now stopping the half-step at the 5th step will look into why the newton iterator isn't behaving on the EHY conversion. May actually be something in the surface definition?
