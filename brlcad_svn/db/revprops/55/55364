Inching closer to functional win64 define logic - ftell and fseek need stdio included up front, otherwise we get a re-definition error when programs include stdio later.  ftell is defined before ftelli64 in stdio.h, so a premature substitution results in an error attempting to re-define ftelli64 with its correct definition after it has already been defined using the ftell definition.
