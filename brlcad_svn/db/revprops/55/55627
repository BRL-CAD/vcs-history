richard identified a bug in the mged/archer autoview command where it was calucating the view size/center dramatically wrong for some geometry (including a pipe in our toyjeep example).  the problem was a primitive that was not properly setting it's min/max value and the autoview command starting with unininitalsed variables.  fix was simply to init them proper to INF/-INF.
