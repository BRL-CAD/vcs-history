automation and reduction.  there are steps we're not doing, reflect on why and adjust:  too many compiles.  once we pass tests on trunk, make the latter checks be more simple.  provide even more automation to include lines for creating new binary dirs and uploading release notes into them.  also *automatically* update the README and NEWS files with a little bit of regex magic.  release is almost fully automatable into a script now...
