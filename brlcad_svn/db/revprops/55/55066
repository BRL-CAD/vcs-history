with bob and keiths help, we finally figured out what was wrong in lesson 15.  it's a four-year old bug with a 30-year legacy.  see previous commit log message for all the nitty gritty detais.  basically had to update the ordering now that they match the change in 7.14.6 to make the rpp vertices match arb8.
