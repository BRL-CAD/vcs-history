Newton iterator wasn't converging to a solution for the EHY primitive converted to a BREP. The inverse jacobian was causing the iterator to jump to a solution that was farther away than the current point. Added a better half-step of the UV deltas until a closer solution is found. Will half-step up to 1000 iterations before bailing on the shotline. Need to look at the surface to see why its causing such large steps but is a fix in the near term. This was turned up by Richard Weiss while testing 'rtarea' results from BREP conversions of our implicits.
