__STRICT_ANSI__ is not the right define to key off of as it catches c89 and c99 (for gcc and clang).  if we're compililing gnu89 pedantic, we need to check for GNU inline behavior, which is indicated for gcc 4.1+ and clang via the __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ define.  leaving __STRICT_ANSI__ in place to not rock the windows boat prior to release.
