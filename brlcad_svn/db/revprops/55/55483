Offset is fastf_t here, not plane_t - was causing the final value of planes to be corrupted in a g2asc - asc2g cycle.  Cause was incorret parameters used during a switch to bu_offsetofarray from bu_offsetof to quell compiler warnings (r54133).  Need to double check any other offset code with similar changes to make sure no similar bugs were introduced. Sean identified the specific problem with the bu_offsetofarray inputs.
