the idents command now skips over non-union combination members above the region level.  to quote commit r55553: these members of a combination don't add positively to the defined regions of space and their region ID's will not show up along a shotline unless positively added elsewhere in the hierarchy.  This was causing headaches for users generating an association table from our idents listing.
