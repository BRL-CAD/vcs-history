The non-uniform binary space partitioning tree used to partition solids into RPP cells within librt to speed raytracing was using an absolute "nudge" value to walk/step the ray into the next partition cell. In certain circumstances the "nudge" value was causing grazing cell hits to walk over thin intersections even when these intgersections were greater than the thinness tolerance. This update modified this code to use our distance tolerance instead. Now our distance tolerance default or a user specified value can be used. This was turned up by Richard Weiss while testing 'rtarea' results from BREP conversions of our implicits.
