Add a test geometry for SSI - surface tree approach is not so suitable for intersection of two plane surfaces, and we need some special handling. It includes transverse intersection curve, tangent intersection curve, tangent intersection point, overlap intersection and some other corner cases - a good test case to test to find the problem in and improve the SSI routine.
