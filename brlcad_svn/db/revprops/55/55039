tom browder made a sweeping update to all of the existing manual pages (fortunately before the were all converted to doxygen) in r51302 where he corrected and updated missing author/copyright/bugreport sections, eliminated references to our old cadbug.sh script, and (yowsa) actually made the copyright year reflect the dates of editing based on earliest svn log entry (including parent for changed paths).  impressive.
