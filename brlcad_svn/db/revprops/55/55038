richard added several new man pages for mged commands reid, bot_sync, bot_flip, bot_split, and rtarea.  the latter already existed, but was updated with mged-specific information (we need a way to consolidate/reuse these nuggets).  the rest were merely knowledge passed through the generations... so nice rounding out of docs to have them added.
