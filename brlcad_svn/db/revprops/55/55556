talked with some of our s2 users and we're going to go ahead with the new INFINITY values even though they introduce/expose changes to results.  changing infinity results in slightly different bsp cell traversal (grazing case) but the object being reported was always on the shotline to begin with.  the decision was to allow this change since the new hits encountered are correct.
