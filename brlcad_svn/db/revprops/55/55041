bob added a new way to edit matrices in archer that mged does not support in r51689, namely the ability to edit the matrix above some member of a combination.  to quote: Previously, mouse interactions resulted in edits getting pushed into the selected object. That is if the selected object was a combination, the edits wound up as matrices above all members in the combination. And if the selected object was a primitive, the edits were pushed into the primitive. Archer has another mode button in the toolbar for deciding how mouse interactions are applied to the select object.
