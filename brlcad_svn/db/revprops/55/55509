revert r54186 that intended to prevent confusion of negative numbers and number options.  the change introduced a bug with parsing of numeric options that don't have a space after the option and multi-option strings (e.g., -s128 -8abc).  the comment in the patch also incorrectly stated that options could only be a-zA-Z0-9 (punctuation is also allowed).  need a proper regression test case that we can compare against expected behavior from system getopt (if available) like we do for some of the other libbu unit tests.
