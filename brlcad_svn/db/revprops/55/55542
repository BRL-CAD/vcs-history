fix the silent error that was causing mged to run without a slew of commands being available.  if we can't build a tclIndex, stop hard because something went terribly wrong.  sync ami.tcl and ampi.tcl too so they basically do the same thing (might want to merge at some point).  print the actual error if there was one.
