update the inside command parameters to match the new rpp vertex behavior that was made to match the ordering of an arb8 in 7.14.6 (r33973).  the "right" parameters were ironically the ones already documented in a note when the lessons were written up in 2001 as having changed.  tracing back through the commit history, it looks like this however was entirely unintentional (i.e., it was a bug) that was documented here instead of getting fixed.

what had happened: circa 1985 (r373) 'in' command directly implemented rpp (matching arb8), circa 1987 (r1518) wdb rpp routine added (with "natural origin" but not matching arb8), circa 2000 (r18885) 'in' command updated to use libwdb (inadvertently changing the order), circa 2009 (r33973) wdb routine finally fixed to match arb8, and now the doc finally gets fixed to match.  so there ya have it, took three devs scratching heads for a day to figure this all out.

left a note on how to verify the right values ('l' command so as to not rely on graphical inspection) and the old command so the docs will still work with older releases.
