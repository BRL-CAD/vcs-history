bob fixed a bug / expanded support in r52470 to better support multiple monitors under linux.  for setups not using xinerama or some other mechanism for treating multiple hardware displays as one big virtual display, this fix makes it work even if X is configured to treat them separately, returning the proper visual for the right screen.
