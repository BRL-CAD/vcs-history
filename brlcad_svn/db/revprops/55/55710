Add (commented out) file that attemps to make nicer bot wireframes using a surface patch breakout technique.  Proving to be too slow for interactive use in its current form - hot spot is determing which faces share the edges with any one particular face, and even if that can somehow be made fast the pre-processing really should be done in parallel.  Checkpointing so a revert point is available.
