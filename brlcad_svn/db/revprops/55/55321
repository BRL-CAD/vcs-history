This fixes the lighting problem exhibited in Archer when displaying geometry in shaded mode with perspective. The main issue here is that the perspective matrix needs to be fed separately to openGl's projection matrix stack instead of feeding the modelview matrix stack a matrix that has both view and perspective rolled into a single matrix.
