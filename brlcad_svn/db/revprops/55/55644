need stdlib.h for modf() and nextafter() but remove the long double support since it requires build system infrastructure.  several relatively common platforms (some not so common, some common) don't support long doubles.  (gnulib quotes FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, Solaris 9, Cygwin, Interix 3.5)  moreover, we'd need other changes to make fastf_t be more than single or double precision.
