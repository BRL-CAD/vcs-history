Copy-pasted bodies of Create member functions added a heap object to a map, and then deleted the object if loading failed. Supposing the object was deleted, later reference to it via the map caused a segfault. The simple fix was complicated by the number of instances that had to be fixed, so the duplicated logic has been pulled into a static member of the parent STEPEntity class, and the subclass Create members now just call that function, passing the variable elements, namely their class name and a newly added GetInstance function that returns a new instance of the class.
