isst wasn't using the brlcad target macros for its library because it needed a custom install directory location.  Rather than ditch the macro setup (which does lots of nice things automatically) add the NO_INSTALL option already used for executables to the library macro as well.  This lets us pass the NO_INSTALL flag for the isst library to disable the automatic install call and we can instead substitute our own customized version.
