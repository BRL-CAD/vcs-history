thanks netbsd 5 ... they partially implemented TLS support so it compiles and links, but will simply crash at runtime. (gives __tls_get_addr() runtime link failure on library linkage)  change the test to also run the test, not just compile it for the __thread test only to catch this failure.  pthread fallback should hopefully still work.
