For the 'idents' command skip over non-union combinations above the region level, these members of a combination don't add positively to the defined regions of space and their region ID's will not show up along a shotline unless positively added elsewhere in the hierarchy. This is causing headaches for users generating an association table from our 'idents' listing.
