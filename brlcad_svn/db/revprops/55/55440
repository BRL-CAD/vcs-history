keith also fixed/improved nurbs ray tracing of objects (e.g., EHY) defined with substantial rapid uv-domain changes.  the surface tree presently only carves up the surface based on 3d flatness criteria, but the EHY provided a case where the surface is substantially flat but has huge non-linear uv domain curvature.  the fix for now was to be a little more careful about walking and trying a little harder to find the surface point before giving up.  this makes the walk slightly slower but more robust too.  long term may be to make the surface tree also (or only) consider the uv-domain curvature.
