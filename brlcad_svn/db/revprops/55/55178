Try to tighten up the reporting when we have mixed paths - 'MATCHES' appears to be too loose.  For some reason on Linux Mint libXpm is in /usr/lib rather than /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu - that's fine, but the path difference triggers the reporting notice since it looks similar to cases on Mac OSX that are trouble - try not to say more than we need to.  While we're at it, sync the src/other copies.
