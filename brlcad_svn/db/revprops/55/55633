reminded of some instanity in the C standard that has comments parsed in phase 3 BEFORE the preprocessor (phase 4) so even #if 0 // comments being compiled in -pedantic mode will cause gcc to issue a warning.  it's a silly unhelpful interpretation by the gcc devs (that a warning needs to be issued in phase 3 just because it's a comment issue even if the comment is in code hidden by the pre-processor.  at least accommodating the silly is simple.
