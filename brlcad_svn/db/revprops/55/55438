keith traced down (pun intended) a problem with the 'nudge' of librt's spatial partitioning walk where it would nudge the ray 0.01mm into a cell with the intent to avoid floating point issues (presumably).  this was causing very subtle edge-grazing effects where we'd miss geometry that should have resulted in a sliver of a hit.  problem encountered with axis-aligned arb8's and 35/25 rays shooting down an edge and missing, detected during comparisons with NURBS brep conversions of that same geometry that was reporting a hit.  their BBox is bigger, so the nudge was (presumably) still inside.
