The grave accents (`) around the UNAME command in the "C" program
were being processed by the Shell by the CAT command, *before*
the C compiler had processed the #ifdefs.
This means that on pure-BSD systems with no UNAME command at all,
two "uname: not found" messages would be printed before the compiler
would run.
Fix:  Move the SGI and Sun cases up fully into the "uname" block
of code, and delete them from the "C" block.
