Updated function 'nmg_cut_loop' within file 'nmg_mod.c'. This update supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by default since it is untested in the production code. This code was updated since the 2nd parameter passed into 'nmg_split_lu_at_vu' is added to the new loopuse created by 'nmg_split_lu_at_vu'. Because of this, the 2nd parameter should be vu2 because when 'nmg_cut_loop' is called and returns, it is expected that vu1 remain within the same loopuse as when 'nmg_cut_loop' was called. This change corrected a problem within the function 'cut_unimonotone' within the while (verts > 3) loop where after a cut when the to/from vertex is the same, the 'nmg_cut_loop' would return with the 1st parameter (vu1) returning being associated with the new loopuse (i.e. with 3 vertices) instead of the old loopuse which we need to finish cutting. The while (verts > 3) loop moves to the next cut based on the loopuse associated with the 1st parameter (vu1) so when the loopuse of vu1 changes the logic breaks in the while (verts > 3) loop. This update is a work in progress.
