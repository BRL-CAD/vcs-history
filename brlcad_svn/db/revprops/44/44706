Corrected logic in functions 'nmg_booltree_evaluate' and 'nmg_boolean' within file 'nmg_bool.c'. This fix stops the error 'nmg_boolean() result of nmg_booltree_evaluate() isn't tp' which occurs occasionally when performing nmg boolean operations such as when using the mged 'facetize' command. This change also allows boolean operations to return a null result without failing.
