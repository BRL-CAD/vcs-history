Updated the header file for libbn (i.e. bn.h) to include the definition of new prototype versions of the functions 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3' and 'bn_isect_line3_line3' located in the file 'plane.c'. The names of these new function are 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3_new' and 'bn_isect_line3_line3_new'. These functions support the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse). Preprocessor commands were added to disable these changes by default. This code is a work in progress.
