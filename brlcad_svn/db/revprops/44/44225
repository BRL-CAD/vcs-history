bob found/fixed a bug with the title command.  presumably, this would convert the working units to mm if you tried to set the title via the units command.  looks like the bug is very old dating back to July 2000, r18822, when a db_v4_get_units_code() snippet was converted to a db_update_ident() parameter.
