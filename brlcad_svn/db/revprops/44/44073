document the db5_standard* functions, pulling comments from source to header and expanding with a note that they're new/private.  reimplement db5_standardize_avs() using simple two-pass logic so standard attributes take precedence.  use db5_standard_attribute() in conjunction with db5_standardize_attribute() in leu of tables so we don't have to repeat any values or even be aware of what is standard or not.
