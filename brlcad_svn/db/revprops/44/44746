accept kunigami's sf patch 3250116 (Corrected funcionality to bu_basename) that makes bu_basename() correspond more closely with basename() albeit with different memory management behavior, the latter being more consistent with bu_dirname().  this annoyingly requires that all bu_basename calls must now bu_free the memory returned but is the non-destructive thread-safe reentrant option for now.  a compromise to consider may be to pass the fill-buffer in as a parameter (ala snprintf/memcpy/etc)..; coincidentally, kunigami added a nifty test harness, which has been modified from the original patch to test other cases (empty, null).
END
