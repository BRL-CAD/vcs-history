yay understanding.  document how RT_GET_TREE() and RT_FREE_TREE() are/were working.  it's basically a linked list that reuses free'd tree items so we never allocate more than the largest amount in use at any one time.  pretty nifty.  (allocating in batches might be even better)  add a new RT_INIT_TREE macro that will initialize a union tree to zero with the magic set, make RT_GET_TREE init every tree returned so callers never have to deal with the magic number directly.
