Experimental build.  There was something really screwy with the way pkg was handling chunks of data larger than 24k, so i unwired the send and recv portions of pkg and "rolled my own".  Things are much more stable and much faster.  There is still a bit of work todo, but geomcore compiles and runs at this point.
