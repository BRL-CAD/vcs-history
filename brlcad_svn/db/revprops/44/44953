Tweaked version of RamDebugger - diff with vanilla version 7.8 to see differences.  Removed a few extensions and there is more to remove, if this were ever to be properly set up for what BRL-CAD needs - many features like cvs aren't particularly important to us, for example...  Changes here were done using the enable-all-local-libs build options.
