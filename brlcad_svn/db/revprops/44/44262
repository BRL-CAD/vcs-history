Added a new prototype version of the function 'cut_unimonotone' to the file 'nmg_tri.c'. This function supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse). This function performs a triangulation of a outer loop (OT_SAME loopuse) by using ear clipping. This function will be renamed later since it is not triangulating/cutting a unimonotone polygon. Preprocessor commands were added so this new function is disabled by default. This code is a work in progress.
