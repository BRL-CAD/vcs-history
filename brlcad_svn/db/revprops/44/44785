previously undocumented keith's modification because the change wasn't expected to be user-visible, but it turns out it was (for pixel accurate grazing selection), so credit us both for changing the spatial partition traversal ordering.  keith originally fixed a traversal 'bug' where it was walking cut planes something like XYXYXYXYX (missing Z).  he changed it to traverse YZXYZXYZX, but that caused a different cell to get selected first and differences were seen for overlapping objects.  as a compromise, I modified the change to instead traverse XYZXYZXYZ so the first two selections should be the same as before (hopefully reducing differences, but they're still possible).
