This was an incremental step towards: 1) adding the man command to archer 2) creating a megawidget for the manual page browser, to eliminate code duplication among Archer and MGED. Progress already made on the actual megawidget will be added in a bit.

-Man command now works in Archer

-Changed the method of adding commands to the Manual Page Browser ToC from "insert end" to using -listvariable as recommended here: http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/morewidgets.html

-Archer.tcl: set menu item that called doarcherMan to execute man command directly.

-changed <Button-1> ToC selection binding to the much preferred <<ListboxSelect>>. Now, arrow keys work, click + dragging works, etc.

-Centering the window still isn't working right. Haven't figured that one out yet.

END
