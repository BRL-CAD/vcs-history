I get it.  It was an April Fool's Joke, right??  Revert to r44152 since it makes all sorts of calls to LIBDM macros and the dm struct, requires libdm header.  Mostly because this is right in the middle of source tarball preparations, even if it's a work-in-progress, to be sorted out after the sources are tagged for release.  otherwise, release testing would have to start all over again.  Design-wise, LIBGED shouldn't be calling/using/touching LIBDM (or LIBFB), shouldn't be using 'objects' as in the ged_obj from libtclcad or various 'go_' routines, nor adding to ged public API that doesn't fit the command format.
