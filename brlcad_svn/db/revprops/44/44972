and with that, mark the silly inconsistent error-prone unreliable bu_vls_init_if_uninit() function as deprecated.  there needs to be an INIT macro for bu_vls structs but bu_vls_init() is the better way to go.  the problem stems from memory not getting consistently initialized and/or reset to zero so that the magic check would actually work.  using a NULL pointer or caller-based init flag are safer methods.
