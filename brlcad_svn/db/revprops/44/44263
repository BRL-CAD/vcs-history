Updated function 'pick_pt2d_for_cutjoin' within file 'nmg_tri.c'. This update supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by default since it is untested in the production code. The purpose of the 'pick_pt2d_for_cutjoin' function is to select which vertexuse will be used when performing a cut/join between two loopuse within a faceuse. This update was made since if the 'from' and 'to' cut vertexuse are in the same loopuse, it should be safe to assume the current pt2d records for these vertexuse are correct for the cut. Therefore, do not search for other pt2d vertexuse records, just exit this function using the vertexuse pt2d records passed into this function. If we allow this function to continue and search for alternate vertexuse, sometimes, depending on the number of vertexuse at the cut points, and the complexity of the angles between the edges at the cuts, an incorrect vertexuse is often chosen. This change avoids the error prone logic when we can assume the vertexuse passed into this function are the correct vertexuse for the cut, i.e. when the two vertexuse are in the same loopuse. This update is a work in progress.
