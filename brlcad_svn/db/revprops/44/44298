Add a test to create an empty repo.  May need to add one additional parameter to all these functions - the ability to pass a local subpool (presumably as a void cast struct or some such).  It almost looks like trying to create multiple subpools in different functions from the repo_info parent pool is causing trouble - if one gvm function needs to call another and both are using subpools, may need to use the parent subpool for the child.  Should be looked into.
