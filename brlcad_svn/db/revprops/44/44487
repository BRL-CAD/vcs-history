Ah, interesting.  There is a subtle point with the CMake macros that hadn't previously been triggered - if a subdirectory build runs a macro, a parent directory will not re-run that macro.  Makes sense if the macros only job is to set CMake variables - we're doing more by having the macro write out to a config file.  As a consequence, when a subconfigure uses a macro that puts an entry into CONFIG_H in a subdir, the parent directory won't be able to run that macro.  Need to refactor to do this right - the building of the various CONFIG_H files needs to be explicit and not contained in macro calls.
