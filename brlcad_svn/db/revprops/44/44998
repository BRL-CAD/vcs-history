continue moving towards API consistency and completeness.  start making sure all structs have a common set of macros: BU_[type]_INIT(), BU_[type]_INIT_ZERO, BU_[type]_NULL, along with a few others.  ensure there's a NULL and typedef as well (even though those may be eliminated down the road).  expand doxygen docs while we're at it finishing up bu_list, bu_bitv, and bu_hist for starters.
