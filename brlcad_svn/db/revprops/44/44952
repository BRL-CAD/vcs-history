Early cut at a CMakeified tktreectrl widget.  This and the next few commits are only for the purposes of 'checkpointing' what I have managed to get working as far as RamDebugger goes - not really functional as yet (the basic RamDebugger window comes up, but that's about it), so I'll promptly remove it again - the goal is to have what I did get in svn history if I can devote more resources to it later.
