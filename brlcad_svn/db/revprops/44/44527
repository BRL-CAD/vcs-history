Updated the prototype version of function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' doing some cleanup and re-factoring. The re-factoring created function 'nmg_isect_lseg3_eu' to test if a line segment intersects with any edgeuse within a faceuse. Updated the function 'nmg_triangulate_rm_degen_loopuse' adding code to verify each loopuse has at least 3 unique vertices. The functions 'nmg_isect_lseg3_eu' and 'nmg_triangulate_rm_degen_loopuse' support the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse). Preprocessor commands were added so these updates/additions are disabled by default. This code is a work in progress.
