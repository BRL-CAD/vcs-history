Updated function 'nmg_isect_eu_fu' within file 'nmg_inter.c'. This update supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by default since it is untested in the production code. This update changes a floating point compare against 0.0 to -SMALL_FASTF which should produce a more reliable result. This update is a work in progress.
