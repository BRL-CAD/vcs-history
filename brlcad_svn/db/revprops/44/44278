Added new prototype versions of the functions 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3' and 'bn_isect_line3_line3' to the file 'plane.c'. The names of these new function are 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3_new' and 'bn_isect_line3_line3_new'. These functions support the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse). At some point the new and original version of these functions will be consolidated. Preprocessor commands were added so these new function are disabled by default. This code is a work in progress.
