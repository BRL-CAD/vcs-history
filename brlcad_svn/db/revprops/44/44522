Updated functions 'paint_face' and 'nmg_shell_manifolds' within file 'nmg_manif.c'. There was a datatype mismatch in the function parameters and some array datatypes were incorrect and there size was incorrect. This fix stops a seg fault when running facetize on large models. This also improves the boolean operations of facetized cgs geometry.
