ManBrowser is now ready to be used by Archer and MGED

Added -disabledPages and -enabledPages to give more control over which commands are displayed. 

Configured constructor to call configbody's with blank args if user didn't configure public variables, in order to trigger defaults.

Removed \"get\" method, as it doesn't appear to be necessary the way things are done now. 

Renamed cmd/commands etc. variable name components to page/pages, since they're not necessarily commands (ex: Introduction.html).

Changed regex uses to \[file\] commands.

The select method now returns boolean result to reflect failure

END
