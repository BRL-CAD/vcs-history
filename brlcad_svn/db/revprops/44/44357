Corrected a bug in function 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3_new' in file 'plane.c' within the libbn library. This is a prototype version of the function 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3'. Preprocessor commands were added so this prototype version is disabled by default. The bug was when line segments are colinear, dist[1] returned from this function has an alternate meaning, it is the distance along the 'p' line segment (not 'q') therefore it must be scaled by the magnitude of the 'p' line segment (i.e. pmag), not  the magnitude of the 'q' line segment. Added/updated/moved bu_log messages for debugging, added/updated comments. This prototype function supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse). At some point the new and original version of 'bn_isect_lseg3_lseg3' will be consolidated. This code is a work in progress.
