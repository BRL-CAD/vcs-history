Updated function 'nmg_2edgeuse_g_coincident' within file 'nmg_info.c'. This update supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by default since it is untested in the production code. The original code appears to contain a bug where it assumes 'edge geometries are everywhere coincident' when all previous checks are inconclusive. This update is a work in progress.
