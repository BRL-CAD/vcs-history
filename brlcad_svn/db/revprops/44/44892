Adding '-sorted' to lsearch's in few places where it's clear that the given list was A) sorted '-increasing' B) sorted as ASCII text C) was not modified before the search D) not sorted with any of '-all'/'-not'/'-glob'/'-regexp'. This option results in increased performance, since it forces lsearch to do a binary search, rather than the default linear search.

Of all 58 instances of lsort in BRL-CAD tcl scripts that were inspected, only 3 obvious cases of missing 'lsearch -sorted' options were found following them.
