Updated function 'nmg_bool' in file 'nmg_bool.c'.  This update supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by default since it is untested in the production code. This update corrects potential corruption in the classlist array.  This update is a work in progress.
