Updated the header file 'raytrace.h' to include the definition of a new prototype function 'nmg_dump_model'.  This new function is located in file 'nmg_tri.c'. This update supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse). Preprocessor commands were added to disable this change by default. This code is a work in progress.
