A Big Code Deadness Elimination Fest, G.  Huzzah...  Remove code that is #if 0'd out unless there's a comment or some other strong evidence that the code really needs to hang around because it's useful, is part of a recent work in progress (still should document why it's if 0'd), or is code that is clearly demonstrating some useful purpose (beyond "this 'might' be useful some day").  Reduction of 2680 lines.
END
