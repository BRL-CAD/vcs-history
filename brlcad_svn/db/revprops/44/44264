Updated function 'is_convex' within file 'nmg_tri.c'. This update supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse) and is disabled by default since it is untested in the production code. This code was updated since during loopuse triangulation, sometimes it is necessary to allow degenerate triangles (i.e. zero area). Because of this, we need to allow the definition of convex to include 0 and 180 degree angles. The original code here contains a bug since the units of 'angle' is radians but the units of 'tol->perp' is not. Since changing any tolerances related to nmg triangulation seem to have both negative and positive impacts, I decided not to arbitrarily correct this bug. This update is a work in progress.
