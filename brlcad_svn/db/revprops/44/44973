Added a thread sleep in the GSConnection run loop to keep from hogging a CPU.  Fixed buffer size checking in tryMakeNetMsg(), it was incorrectly thinking there was insufficient data to deserialize and bailing out.  Also fixed waitForMsg() as the totalRead parameter was not being reset after the loop was finished.
