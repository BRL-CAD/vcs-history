sync with trunk just so we have a matching merge at the point of sync.  this restores the itcl/itk initialization to using their *_Init() functions instead of attempting Tcl_Eval("package require").  with cmake's simpler 'preinstalled-yet-intact-hierarchy' build approach, the package require will probably work but so should the Init too, so sync and revisit after merged.
