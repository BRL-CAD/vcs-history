bad AVS, no donut for you.  BU_AVS_FOR() macro iterator starts from the end of the avs to the beginning.  however, if the avs is empty, this would result in indexing into a -1 index and potentially cause a segfault.  make the loop safe by setting it to null if count is zero, so it should kick right out of the loop.
