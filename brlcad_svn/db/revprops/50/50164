BOT hits were disappearing from the segment when using TIE. TIE was determining correct hits on tri's but was losing these when creating the hit segments in rt_bot_makesegs_(). The rt_bot_makesegs_() function uses the hit_vpriv[] from the hit structure to clean up odd hits, exit before entrance, or dangling entrance hits but this was not being set in TIE. Added code in TIE hitfunc() to populate these variables similar to what is done in non-TIE BOT code.
