if we cast the pointer and the head pointer, we will avoid a pointer-type mismatch if someone happens to use a non bu_list type.  arguably an error, but there's nothing that technically requires the head pointer actually be a bu_list struct.  that change lets us fix BU_LIST_FOR_CIRC() which was being used in nmg code with non-bu types.
