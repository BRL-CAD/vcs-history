Updated function "db5_sync_attr_to_comb" in file "librt/db5_types.c". Changed the name input to the directory structure. This was necessary so that the directory "d_flags" region bit could be set/unset based on the "region" attribute. Before this change, when using the mged "red" command to add/remove attribute "region=R", the mged "attr show" command would not indicate the change even though the attribute "region=R" was successfully added or removed. Updated function "db_recurse" in file "librt/db_tree.c". Changed the call to function "db5_sync_attr_to_comb" to pass in the directory instead of the combination name.
