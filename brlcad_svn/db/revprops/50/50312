Start working up a 7.20.6 NEWS file - will be tagging off of STABLE this time, since trunk still needs more work to be release ready.  Eventually we'll need to sync the main trunk NEWS file back up with this one, but for now just work on getting the release out.  For now attaching revision numbers associated with each change to the news line covering it - those will be taken out before release is tagged, but for now they help keep straight what has and has not been merged in from trunk.
