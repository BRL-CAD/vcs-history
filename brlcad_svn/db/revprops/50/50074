looks like BVNode<BV>::isTrimmed() is trying to set a pointer, so we need a pointer to it for it to persist back to the caller.  this fixes a deadcode condition detected by coverity (CID 209), which looks like a bonefide bug in the trimming code where it was keeping track of an adjacent trimmed face id (where it would always get set to -99).
