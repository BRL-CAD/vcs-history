cliff removed hideline.c in r48460 when it came up with a coverity maintenance cost, but this reference to f_hidline() lingered.  upon investigating, it was commented out back in 3.1 by phil with a note saying it doesn't work everyone, so sounds good to finally fully kill it regardless.  the command supposedly produced a plotfile hidden line style rendering.
