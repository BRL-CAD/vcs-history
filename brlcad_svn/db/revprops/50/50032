after hours of trying to follow the logic, take a stab at a simple sanity check solution to an ARRAY_VS_SINGLETON issue being detected by coverity (cid 98).  it reports some path through the code resulting in the original head node getting incremented.  fix is to make sure we're not incrementing what we started with (since if it's a nugrid node, it should have been set to soemthing else on the first pass).
