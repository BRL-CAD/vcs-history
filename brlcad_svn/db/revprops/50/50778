prevent memory corruption if we end up with a null pointer.  probably implies someting is wrong elsewhere in the book-keeping, but since this is old v4 code there's minmal value hunting it down.  just avoids corruption which was leading to a bogus rt_freemem() debug message getting printed extensively after the endianness flip.
