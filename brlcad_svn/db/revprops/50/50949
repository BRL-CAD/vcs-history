there are too many exceptions to the rule that have never been an issue (such as var[i+2] or for (i=1; ..), remove the space around operators rule.  the intent was and still is to avoid complex math expressions that are error-prone to interpret without whitespace around some of the operators that logically group together.  don't need to spend time reformatting, up to the author/editor's discretion as long as the file is self-consistent.
