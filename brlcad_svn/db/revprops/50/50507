icv_image_save_open is already called by do.c:795, resulting in a failure to open the file when viewedge.c attempts to call it again.  Difference looks to be ICV_IMAGE_AUTO_NO_PIX vs ICV_IMAGE_AUTO between the two calls - looking at fileformat.c:278 the only difference is the icv_image_save_open command will not default to returning a pix file if it doesn't recognize the image format via extension.  Unless there is a good reason for rtedge to be a special case, this behavior should probably be consistent across the rt commands one way or the other.
