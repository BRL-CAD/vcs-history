As it turns out, umask settings do have some impact on CMake/CPack builds.  While CMake's install process does not directly make use of umask, the temporary files staged in the build directory do.  The install process in turn makes use of the permissions set on those files.  It does not appear to be possible to set umask from the CMake build itself, so instead warnings are generated if the umask setting looks problematic.
