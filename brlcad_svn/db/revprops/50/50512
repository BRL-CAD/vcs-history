summarize the release process more clearly with the underlying rationale.  the emphasis isn't monthly iteration, so make the steps clear on requirements for sync/tag and announcing release intentions.  include a copy-pasteable mail notification and improve some of the other steps so they can similarly be copy-pasted.  get the last release rev and set MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH for tagging.
