fix a 7+ year old bug making 32-bit and 64-bit binary uniform data objects (binunif).  they were getting stored as 16-bit and 32-bit respectively.  coverity noticed the unreachable 128-bit condition, but the 'fix' in r48823 didn't catch the underlying bit-offset error in the switch statement.  commenting out the 128-bit case merely masked the problem further.  fortunately, dsp binunif and byte files (the two common use cases) are unaffected.
