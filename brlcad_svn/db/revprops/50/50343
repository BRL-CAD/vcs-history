Had to fix flatness criteria for surface subdivision. Flatness was calculated by multiplying a series of Surface normal Dot products at select points on the surface.  Hit a case where small cylindrical surface had even numbered negative vdots and were canceling their signs. Simplified to look at each vdot individually.
