several hours debugging rt, but still can't find the cause of the crash.  document what I've been able to figure out so far (i.e., not much).  summary seems to be a crash using the noise shader (turb) due to corruption in libbn noise bookkeeping or parallel memory management while rendering our sample terra.g model.
