minor rewording.  tom fixed rtweight to handle blanks, comment lines, malformed lines, and the modified NIST materials file; problem was fscanf stops scanning on input at first error and thus the infinite loop: using fgets forces each line to be read; an extra buffer is needed in that case to handle the line input versus the sscan buffer for reading tokens (but I didn't try using the same buffer for both).  he also improved rtweight behavior on windows by converting to bu_fgets() now reading unix density files properly on windows and vice versa.
