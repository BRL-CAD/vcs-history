Investigating off-by-many errors in the solids regression test, Keith noticed view script differences.  Compared to Linux, Mac viewscripts differed in the last/15th place after the decimal point.  Cliff observed calculations from cos() differing on the 16th digit prior to being written out, undoubtedly due to subtle implementation differences (round vs truncate) as "real" value was nearly halfway between cos() values being calculated for Linux and Mac.  Double-precision IEEE floating point only guarantees 15-17 digits of precision, depending on the calculation, so using a .15 precision specifier makes our printed value dip into unreliable territory (1+15 significant digits).  By pulling the value up to .14, we get 15 digits of precision, identical view scripts, and the solids test passes without differences.  Looking through our history, this seems to be safe as the value prior to printing quaternions was %.9e.  Anything from 9->14 should be safe.
