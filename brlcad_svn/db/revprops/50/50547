add a line item for the conversion of implicit geometry into boundary representation format now that they are predominantly all implemented and seem to be working well (as seen by csgbrep conversion testing and brep mged command).  95+% all cliff with some support from wu on fixing up ehy, ell, hyp and 'brep' command.  also, a smidgen from yours truly fixing various memory management bugs and stabbing in the initial solid bspline->brep conversion.
