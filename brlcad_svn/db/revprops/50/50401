per IRC discussion in the aftermath of an autotools removal revert, tighten up the deprecation language to specify two minor release needing to include the deprecation notice.  include an example so it's even more explicit and not subject to intepretation.  strictly speaking, this reduces our deprecation window by a minor but makes the policy about as tight as it can get without being reckless or non-existent.
