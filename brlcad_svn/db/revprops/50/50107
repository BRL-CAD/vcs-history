convert the array index into an explicit case where we manually wrap around.  this should overflow and underflow reports from coverity and makes the intent hopefully a little more clear that this is some sort of wrapping convolution.  'should' preserve existing behavior but warrants testing (anyone have a tgf handy?) since it's prime for an off-by-one error.  cid 323.
