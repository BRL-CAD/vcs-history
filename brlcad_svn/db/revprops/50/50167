Commented out early bail out of BREP bounding-box intersect routine to also include bounding-boxes behind the ray origin. Lets the calling application handle cases where ray starts inside of a solid. We were getting an odd number of hits when rays were being started on the backside but just inside of an existing component messing up the segment in/out logic. Could have injected an "in hit" at the ray origin but most solids would have returned the calculated "in hit" at a negative distance from the origin.
