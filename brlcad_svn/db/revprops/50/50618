qualify all of the calls to the dist proc as being in the top-level namespace.  apparently if you qualify one in a proc, but not others, some version(s) of tcl assume the non-qualified one are for a non top-level scope even if a local one doesn't exist.  problem reported by Csanyi Pal via brlcad-users mailing list trying to use sketch editor.
