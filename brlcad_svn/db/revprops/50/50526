Add png ouput support, make the option handling a bit smarter - can spot .g, .pix and .png file specifiers without needing -i and -o options (although setting input and output files with the options overrules no-option specifiers) and treats any remaining unknown args as full color specifiers.  Net result is rtwizard feels a bit more like rt until you start adding on extra options, although -F/dev/X still needs to be -F /dev/X with rtwizard for now.
