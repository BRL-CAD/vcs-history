keith fixed a surprising bug in the relatively new BoT mesh TIE rendering bug where segments were being lost during rt_bot_makesegs. it was using a hit_vpriv array that TIE was never filling in, used for cleaning up odd hits, exiting before entrance, and dangling entrace cases.  this consequently was related to another issue where hit segments were off by 1.01 units.
