Changed flatness test back to to running product of the normal vector of the frenet frame projected onto each other normal in the frame set. Also added early bail once flatness criteria fails. Added straightness test in a similar manner using the tangent from the frenet frame. Changed getCurveEstimateOfV()/getCurveEstimateOfU() to solve using subdivision. Added tolerence value of BREP_EDGE_MISS_TOLERANCE  so we can get NEAR misses from  isTrimmed().
END
