Updated files xpush.c list.c copyeval.c showmats.c find.c pathsum.c wcodes.c wdb_obj.c trace.c ged_private.h push.c get_obj_bounds.c prefix.c and edcodes.c within the libged library. Changed functions 'ged_list' (ie mged 'l' command, lowercase L) and ged_pathsum (ie mged 'paths' command) to accept an addition parameter '-t' meaning terse to reduce the amount of information displayed when using these commands. This is useful when you want to use the 'l' command on a very large bot and do not want to see all full listing of millions of vertices and faces. Within function 'ged_pathsum' removed the call to clear 'ged_result_str' since in some cases we want to keep the information already in this string when entering this function. We just want to append to the 'ged_result_str'. Also initialized the '_ged_trace_data' structure as a sanity check. Fixed a seg-fault then the pattern string is just '/'.
