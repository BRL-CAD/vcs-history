suprising this hasn't been provided by now, but add an option for reading angles as radians or degrees.  most of our tools take degree angles but could just as easily take both.  avoid 'R' since it implies radius, but perhaps a 'rad' and 'deg' suffix would help.  probably best implemented as a libbn function.
