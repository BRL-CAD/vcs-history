Generalize the mechanism for passing flags from libraries up to other libraries automatically - had been assuming we could apply all flags to all targets, but libged's polycurve.cpp triggered a build error with clang (and had been warning with gcc) when the std=gnu99 flag got applied.  Only a problem with libged currently, but potentially could apply to any mixed C/C++ library. Approach now is more granular - can define C and CXX variables independently to pass up, and BRLCAD_ADDLIB will only apply C flags to C files and CXX flags to C++ files.
