nick fixed a bug in the conversion of ascii hyp objects into .g format where it would fall-through and try to create an eto of the same name.  this undoubtedly resulted in either a crash, (likely) error message saying it couldn't make the eto, or eto replacing the hyp.  fixed due to coverity cid 335, in r48532.
