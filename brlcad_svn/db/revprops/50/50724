apply sf patch 3530033 from Al_Da_Best ( aldabest ) - 'Adding centroid and surface area for ellipsoid primitive' though the patch now only adds surface area since someone else beat him to the centroid function.  the patch was slightly modified for strict compilation and still has a problem using fabs() and a hard-coded 0.0001 magic tolerance value, but can't fault him too much for that error since someone else apparently introduced that bad practice in the bbox routine.
