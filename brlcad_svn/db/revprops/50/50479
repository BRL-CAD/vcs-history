The workaround for xsltproc's failure to place man output in the correct location when odd pathnames are used is needed for ALL outputs generated - was failing in the multi-file output case.  Scrap the extra macro, and instead make the extra outputs source file properties in CMake.  The standard macros then check for and use the contents of those properties.  Somewhat cleaner and should be more robust.  For the first time in a while, distcheck-full passes on Linux with CMake.
