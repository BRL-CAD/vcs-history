Compiler warnings because of dynamically sized arrays based on runtime variable were resolved by allocating memory in r45741 (which was not subsequently being freed). Since these sizes are known at compile time, we can instead size the arrays using preprocessor macros. Also resolved, were 3 warnings about printf format specifiers; the pointers needed to be dereferenced.
