Updated function nmg_class_pt_s within file nmg_class.c. This change supports the prototype version of the nmg_triangulate_fu function. Within function nmg_class_pt_s it uses the raytracer to classify if a point is in, out or on a shell. During the computations of determining this, line intersection functions are used where some require finite line segments. To help resolve some of the computation problems I added a magnitude to the ray direction vector instead of the vector being a unit vector. The nmg model bounding box was used to determine the ray length. This is a work is progress. This change is disabled by default.
