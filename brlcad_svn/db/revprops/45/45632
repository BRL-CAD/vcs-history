eliminate all of the __OSTORE__ sections.  considered dead code because there was no managed way to enable those code sections.  appears to be a binding to a commercial API (Progress Software Corp's ObjectStore product), so remove in favor of simplified code maintenance and reduced complexity.  removes almost 3k lines of code.
