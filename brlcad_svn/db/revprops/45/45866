Enabled use of bounding box centers of objects as points. Basic object translations are working "translate -k obj1 -a obj2 obj3", "translate -a obj2 obj1", etc. (redrawing is broken, the objects have to be blasted). It turns out that getting the natural origin is what is causing the 0,0,0 coordinates; haven't been able to figure out why. Many things aren't working yet. At least some translations using reference vectors are working.
