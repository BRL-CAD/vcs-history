enabled the build of static libs for MSVC
Static libs shouldn't export symbols like the DLLs because they are linked directly.  Thats why the BRLCAD_DLL flag will be set for DLLs only.  The BRLCAD_ADDLIB and BRLCAD_ADDEXEC macros are setting this flag automatically.  If they are not used the BRLCAD_DLL flag has to be set manually if needed.
