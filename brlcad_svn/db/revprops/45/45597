remove rtmlt.  it was never a completed nor working implementation of metropolis light transport.  since it's become a maintenance burden (quellage) and isn't being worked on by anyone, time for removal.  kunigami's progress on the osl integration is already further along, so renewed interest can be concentrated there.
