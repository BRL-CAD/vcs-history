fixed a bug in NURBS plot where it was getting stuck in an infinite loop due to hitting an edge case where our v estimate for a given u was _exactly_ hitting the test point causing subsequent tests to repeatedly test the same point over and over.  this edge case is actually a happy done-with-function case so we can just return the precise v value.
