Subcommand functions that are modifying the drawing should have const parameters, since argument processing is done. Implementing this required changes to path.c, which accepted a non-const parameter, which led to a failure to detect that was modifying db_full_path objects when it shouldn't. Resolved edit_cmd naming inconsistencies (subcmd vs. cmd). Minor reorganization of edit.c
