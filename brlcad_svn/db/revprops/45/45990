Warn if we appear to be running archer from a non-install directory with an install already in place - this is the situation where .tcl files will get pulled from /usr/brlcad/* instead of local copies, which if unnoticed by the developer makes for some very frustrating troubleshooting (particularly for those not familiar with bu_brlcad_root's behavior).  We have enough information to spot this situation at runtime, so do it.
