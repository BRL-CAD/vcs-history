Fixed a bug in the mged 'rm' command. This command 'deletes all occurrences of the listed members from the specified combination'. A segmentation fault would occur when a region is displayed in 'mged' and the 'rm' command is used to remove a member of the displayed region and the member occurs in the region more than once. The changed function is 'ged_splitGDL' within the 'libged' library within file 'erase.c'. 

END
