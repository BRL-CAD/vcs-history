Simplified/removed some things in edit(), and resolved several unrelated issues, many of which were recently introduced. Translate isn't quite working yet. There seems to be a problem getting the apparent coordinates of objects, which I think might all be evaluating to (0,0,0). Also, there are several untested option/arg combinations.
