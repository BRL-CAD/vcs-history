Updated function 'rt_tor_tess' within file 'src/librt/primitives/tor/tor.c' by adding a call to function 'nmg_keu_zl' which removes all zero length edgeuse. Under certain conditions the function 'rt_tor_tess' will create a tessellated torus which contains zero length edgeuse which is invalid and causes a crash in later functions. An example of a torus which causes a crash during 'facetize' is object 'old.s82' within the 'm35.g' sample model. This change is disabled by default and supports the prototype version of function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'. This is a work in progress.
