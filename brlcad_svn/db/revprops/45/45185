Updated function 'nmg_booltree_evaluate' within file 'nmg_bool.c'. Removed the call to 'nmg_model_fuse' since it is not necessary here. This is called later within function 'nmg_bool'. This change will increase the speed in which nmg boolean operations are performed. For example, the mged command 'facetize' will run faster.

END
