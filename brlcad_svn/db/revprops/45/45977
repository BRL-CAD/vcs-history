Specifiying one or more coordinates using the -x/-y/-z options is working. There were missing parenthesis in several places, a couple conditionals that were !'ing when they obviously shouldn't, and space for a vector allocated conditionally when it should have been unconditional. I'll perform more thorough testing once batch operations are working.
