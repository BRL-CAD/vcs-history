major refactoring of the liboptical callback api to expand the function callbacks with their respective parameters.  in doing so, the headp mfuncs list parameter was removed (only used by stack and text shaders) in favor of just generating a new headp via optical_shader_init().  also ended up propagating a slew of genptr_t's instead of char* and some basic constness.  the stronger ansi type checking revealed several inconsistencies that got caught up in the cleanup along the way.
