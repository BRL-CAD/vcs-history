change the name of our iteration log/pix files to be more consistent with the benchmark.log files using -PID prior to the file extension.  also be more careful to only keep a backup once so that a given -PID test iteration backup file should correspond to the previous *benchmark* run, not just the previous *iteration*.  refactor into function since we do the cleanup twice.
