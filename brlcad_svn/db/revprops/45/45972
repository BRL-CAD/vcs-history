Using a single coordinate specifier per argument is now working, i.e. "translate -k -x ab/abc/sphere.s -a -x ab/def/sphere.s cube.s". Crashes if more than one is used per -k/-a/-r option. A routine consolidating multiple -x/-y/-z arguments into an edit_arg is the likely culprint. It was modified to accept a flag controlling whether to skip consolidation of union edit_cmd common.objects or not. Several unrelated corrections/comment updates.
