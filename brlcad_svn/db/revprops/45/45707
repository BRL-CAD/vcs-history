Updated function 'join_mapped_loops' within file 'nmg_tri.c'. Added more error checking and did some code cleanup and improved the existing error messages. Changed some of the logic to support the prototype version of the 'nmg_triangulate_fu' function. Under certain conditions a new vertexuse can be created and it was not adding this to the tbl2d table. The logic changes are a work in progress and are disabled by default.
