change ged_log an ged_result_str from being directly embedded bu_vls structs to being pointers.  this makes the struct smaller but more importantly lets us manage memory and initialization more easily.  sure, the pointer might now be null, but that'll be wrapped soon anyways (and can be validated).  happens to save a lot of '&' typing too. ;)
