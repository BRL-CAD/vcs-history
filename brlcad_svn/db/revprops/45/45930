Make a stab at itk, probably the trickiest of these extensions.  Need to do some more logic consolidation into tcl.cmake and the src/other CMakeLists.txt settings probably need some more study (there are a lot of possible cases) but getting there.  Need to study STUBS usage in the standard Tcl/Tk build more and see if I need some conditionalization logic for those flags...
