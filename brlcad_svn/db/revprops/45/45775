Added new functions 'print_loopuse_tree', 'nmg_classify_pt_loop_new', 'nmg_classify_lu_lu_new', 'insert_above', 'insert_node' and 'nmg_build_loopuse_tree' to file 'nmg_tri.c'. These function are prototype functions which support the prototype version of 'nmg_triangulate_fu'. Some of these functions may have their names changed or moved to a more appropriate location within the code. These functions are the beginning of code which classifies if a loop is within a loop and creates a tree to represent the relationships between the loops within a face. The end result will be groupings of loops containing outer and sometimes inner loops (i.e. holes) which can then have their holes removed (i.e. inner loop joined to an outer loop) and triangulated using ear clipping. These new functions are disabled by default and are a work in progress.
