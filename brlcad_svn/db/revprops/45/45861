make the dsp brep implementation use the new private dsp.h header for the DSP() macro instead of duplicating the code (bad, no donut for you).  similarly, there shouldn't need to be any need to validate the dsp_ip or load it because that would have already happened during import.  redoing that here will just leak memory and be not as good as what is done during import.
