Started on functions that convert db_full_path objects to points (natural origin/bounding box center); WIP. edit() was getting a bit difficult to read, which has led to several bugs, so I broke out batch expansion code into edit_arg_expand(). There are still some problems preventing this from working, but I haven't commited in a while and need to. Several changes to struct edit_arg helper functions; needed more versatility
