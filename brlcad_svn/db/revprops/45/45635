consistently default all builds (particularly fresh svn checkouts) to a system install into /usr/brlcad using rel- for releases and dev- for developer builds.  could probably even just key off of the patch number but leave as-is for now.  this will probably require windows to set the install prefix given there usually is no /usr path but that is needed for windows anyways for release builds.
