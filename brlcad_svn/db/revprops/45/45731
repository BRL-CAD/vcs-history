Updated several helper functions to work with a recent change from automatic arguments in union edit_cmd to pointers. Added command-specific functions to initialize the needed argument pointers. Fixed a problem with the help subsystem, and eliminated a bit of redundancy. More edit() testing, but not a whole heck of lot of foreward progress yet.
