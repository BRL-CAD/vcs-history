fix a bug introduced with the conversion of SCL's string management to using STL's std::string.  null values were getting injected into the parsing output since std::string will happily record a zero-character and keep track of how long the c-string buffer is independent of null-termination.  the streams happily print the entire buffer (i.e., not relying on null termination) causing literal '\0' values to get output.  fix was simple, don't append '\0' values.  should no longer be needed since empty std::string will stream empty.
