Key the static lib building on the build type.  Exposed a problem with making the trigger variable an OPTION in sub-builds - doing so forces the setting into the cache and makes it impractical for the AUTO_OPTION macro to do its thing.  Fortunately, the only files doing that were the ones we wrote - corrected them, and we're good to go.
