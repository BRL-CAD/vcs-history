Due to some previous changes, an edit_arg was set to point at to something before being 'initialized' to NULL, which was causing crashes later on. Also, the natural origin option was still being saved as a character, and the target object flag was not being set. Enabled support for multiple target object arguments. Added helper function to free last arg in a list, broke common functionality out to reduce redundancy. edit_translate_add_cl_args() is improved, but there are still issues. Improved handling of multiple leading/trailing arguments w/o options.
