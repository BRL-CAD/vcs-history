Updated the rt_ars_tess function within file ars.c. I disabled the functions nmg_shell_coplanar_face_merge and nmg_simplify_shell unless the prototype triangulation is enabled. The problem is these functions simplify the ars which causes more work for later triangulating the ars. The original triangulation code is unable to triangulate the resulting ars after being simplifed. In order to raytrace an ars, it is first converted to a bot primitive which requires triangulation. This is a temporary change to allow ars primitives to be raytraced when the original triangulation code is enabled.
