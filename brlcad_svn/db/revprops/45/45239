updated version of osl_rt. It now renders brlcad scenes using osl shaders. the results are still strange, but are getting better. I managed to find a suitable direction for the viewpoint for the scene cornell.g on db/. I did it empirically, since I couldnt extract this information from the orientation quaternion.
