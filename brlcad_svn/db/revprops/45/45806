Reflowed all comments. Enable execution of subcommand functions in edit(), "subcmd->cmd->exec()". The translate command should be operational through ged_edit() once I resolve several issues with edit() and friends. The only exception that I can think of, is the use of the bounding box centers of objects; although everything in edit.c was designed with this in mind, the argument-to-coordinate functions currectly will only use natural origins. It's only a matter of putting up a conditional in one function, to check the relavent edit_arg flags for a missing EDIT_NATURAL_ORIGIN flag, and then calculate the bounding box center rather than the natural origin.

END
