With the improved edit_*_get_arg_head()'s, individual subcommand init functions are no longer necessary; a generic edit_cmd_init() can handle it all. Reduces the number of functions needed for each subcommand to 4; nice. Also in this commit: noticed a variable for a return value being initialized to a literal value, rather than GED_OK.
