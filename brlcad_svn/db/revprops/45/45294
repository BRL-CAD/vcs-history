the wdb tcl objects and ged structures both assume they get to own the wdbp they were passed.  can't just remove the wdb_close() from wdb_deleteProc() as there doesn't seem to be any place in mged where the .inmem wdb is actually recorded (it's stored inside a tcl callback).  so let the tcl objects do their thing, but then that means the ged needs to acquire a full-fledged copy of the wdb and gets treated as another dbi observer.  this requires more extensive testing for release, perhaps a run through valgrind, but seems to be behaving better now.
