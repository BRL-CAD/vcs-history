Updated the prototype version of function 'cut_unimonotone' within file 'nmg_tri.c'. This function supports the prototype version of function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'. Improved the error checking and the logic to cleanup problem loopuse. Also did some code cleanup. This change is disabled by default. This is a work in progress.
