Laid out additional subcommand functions, and added pointers to them into the array of edit_cmd structs. This will help keep subcommands separate from the edit routines, so adding/modifying commands will be more isolated/simpler than I had originally planned. Started on edit(). None of this is not tested very well yet. WIP
