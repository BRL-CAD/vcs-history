Fixed a bug in function 'nmg_triangulate_rm_degen_loopuse' which caused an infinite loop when a loopuse contains a single vertexuse instead of a list of edgeuse. The function now also kills all loopuse which contain only a single vertexuse. The associated single vertexuse is also killed. This function supports the new prototype function 'nmg_triangulate_fu' (nmg triangulate faceuse). Preprocessor commands are added so these updates/additions are disabled by default. This code is a work in progress.
