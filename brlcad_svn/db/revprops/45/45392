Laid out a rough draft of rotate command Manual page. It's proving to be a bit more complex, and require more options than translate; there are still several issues/inconsistencies to work out. Added optional [OFFSET_POS] argument to every object argument in both commands, in order to add flexibility. Removed '.' options to ignore specific coordinates, as it would have conflicted with [OFFSET_POS], and -x/-y/-z options are clearer anyways.
