Updated functions vertex_neighborhood, get_pole_dist_to_face, guess_class_from_hitlist_min, guess_class_from_hitlist_max, isect_ray_snurb_face, record_face_hit, edge_hit_ray_state, ray_hit_vertex, nmg_class_ray_vs_shell within file nmg_rt_isect.c. Many changes are to support the prototype version of nmg_triangulate_fu. The changes associated with this prototype are disabled by default. The prototype related changes create a unitized version of the ray direction vector where needed. The remaining changes which are not related to the prototype function nmg_triangulate_fu are enabled. These enabled changes fix floating point 0.0 compares replacing them with SMALL_FASTF. The result will be more reliable classification of nmg objects during nmg boolean operations which will improve the operation of such commands as the mged 'facetize' and 'ev'. The prototype changes are a work in progress.
