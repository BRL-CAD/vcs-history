fix the uninitialized vls bug reported by starseeker.  indeed, the source name of the shader was not being initialized properly before bu_structparse expands a %V table entry and calls bu_vls_strcpy().  instead of just initializing the vls, though, go ahead and initialize the entire img_specific struct just because it's the awesome thing to do.  profile showed performance unaffected by the setup memcpy().
