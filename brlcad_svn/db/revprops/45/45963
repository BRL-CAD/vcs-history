Use a variation on the three way option trick to get more sophisticated about turning on/off the optimization flags as a function of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - if Auto, optimization flags are on for Release and off for Debug, but 'hard' setting BRLCAD_FLAGS_OPTIMIZATION to ON or OFF will override the build-type based decision.  Also, clear the compile flags before we do our thing to eliminate any flags CMake automatically adds for a given build type - that's why NDEBUG was in the Release compile flags even when we wanted to add debug flags explicitly.
