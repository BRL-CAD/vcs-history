Wrote a function to expand arguments with partial coordinates set, via -x/-y/-z options (support for this was missing in edit()). Required changes to functions for getting object coordinates; they now write to any vector they are passed, so that coordinates may be obtained without modifying the edit_cmd object. Resolved issue in an argument string parsing function, which was incorrectly pairing objects with the coordinates that they followed. Had to remove ability to disable "noisy" in a few places, due to the use of external functions that do not support it. Identified/noted the source of two issues that are causing assert failures/crashes. Shortened several function/var names.
