implement fchmod() for Windows.  this will likely break the Windows build, but committing it since the only issue should be minor header and preprocessor symbolage.  in order to implement fchmod on Windows, we rely on chmod() instead which is available but requires a filename.  this is normally not knowable, but windows provides a roundabout way to get it, so run with it.
