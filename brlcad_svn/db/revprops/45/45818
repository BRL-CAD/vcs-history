fix a FIXME, rename the struct curve definition that was embedded into rt_sketch_internal.  this creates a new rt_curve structure and moves the associated segment structures into rtgeom.  unfortunately requires nmg.h for the knot_vector and cascades a set of name changes, but improvement all around.
