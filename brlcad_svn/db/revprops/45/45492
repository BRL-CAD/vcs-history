Ah hah.  Per http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Version_Compatibility_Matrix, the *IGNORE_PATH variables weren't around until 2.8.3 - that's probably why the new mechanism for ignoring install paths wasn't working in some tests.  Bump our required version, as we need to avoid finding old installed BRL-CAD libraries.
