preliminary testing of the conversion from SCLstring to std::string is showing a consistent speed improvement in step-g for relatively small models.  Models taking less than a few minutes to convert are now taking approximately 10-30% less time.  Unfortunately, models that take more than 10-20 minutes still take 10-20 minutes implying that some other processing dominates as the files get bigger.
