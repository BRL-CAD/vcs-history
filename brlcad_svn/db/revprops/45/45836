Batch arguments were expanding, but only the first set was being executed. Fixing this meant writing a function to duplicate command argument groupings, which in turn required changing the subcommand functions for looping through args. The counters needed to be exposed as paramaters, and made non-static... which should have been done in the first place. Updated the half-dozen or so places that depended on the old logic.
