Cut down on a lot of duplication. Fixed a few issues with subcmd arg helper functions (and most are enabled/used now). ged_edit() generic subcommand argument parsing is nearly done. Still a WIP. Some option combinations are accepted that shouldn't be. It is crashing right now, too. That is to be expected, as it needs edit_str_to_arg() to work properly, and that is incomplete/needs some modifications.
