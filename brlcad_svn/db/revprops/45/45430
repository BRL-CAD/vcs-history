Changed function nmg_model_edge_g_fuse by renaming it to nmg_edge_g_fuse and allowing the magic of a nmg object to be passed in instead of a pointer to a nmg model structure. This change allows the function to fuse edge geometry in other smaller nmg objects such as an nmg shell or nmg faceuse. The following files were changed raytrace.h nmg_simplify.c wdb_obj.c nmg_tri.c nmg_fuse.c nmg_bool.c. The purpose of this change is to improve performance of nmg boolean operations by only fusing edge geometry in the smallest nmg object necessary.
