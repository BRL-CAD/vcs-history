so comparing by -lt makes the timing comparison suck for normal iterations because it causes the comparison to effectively be the floor() of the elapsed time, which makes causes TIMEFRAME to get exceeded (e.g., elp=1.99 will iterate again even if TIMEFRAME=1).  revert back to less-than since what we really need is a do-while loop.  achieve the same by initializing our elapsed counters to negative, so we still get sane behavior at TIMEFRAME=0.
