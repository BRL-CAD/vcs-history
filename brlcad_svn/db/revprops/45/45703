Added two new functions to support the prototype version of nmg_triangulate_fu. These functions are 'nmg_tri_kill_accordions' and 'validate_tbl2d'. The first function is a specialized version of the 'nmg_kill_accordions' function which allows killed vertexuse to be removed (nulled out) from the tbl2d table. The second function verifies that all vertexuse within a faceuse is stored in the tbl2d table. These functions are a work in progress and are disabled by default.
