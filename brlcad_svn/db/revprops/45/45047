may need revisiting, but unsetting and resetting __GNUC_MINOR__ (gcc 4.0.1, mac 10.5) leaves the compiler in some odd state where subsequent header inclusion still think it is undefined (even though #ifdef before their inclusion shows it is!).  removing the protections makes things work again so will have to rediscover a different fix for whatever environment was failing if it still fails.
