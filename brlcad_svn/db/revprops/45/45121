remove the SCLLOG/SCLBOOL wrappers on the SCL Boolean and Logical enums.  they were being conditionally put into a namespace in order to be protected in case they're used within a 3rd party context (like CORBA) that might also define same-named enums, but the macrofied protection just adds complexity.  iff a conflict is encountered, the types can be put into an SCL or P23 or SDAI namespace.  'Boolean' would be prime for outright removal/replacement with 'bool' except it also supports an unknown value so keep it around for now.
