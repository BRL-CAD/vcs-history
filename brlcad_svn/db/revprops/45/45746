Updated functions 'nmg_class_pt_e', 'nmg_class_pt_l', 'class_vu_vs_s', 'nmg_class_pt_s', 'class_eu_vs_s' and 'class_lu_vs_s' within file 'nmg_class.c'. Most of the updates were changes to support the prototype version of function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'. The remainer of the changes were code cleanup. The logic changes are disabled by default and are a work in progress. These changes are related to classification of nmg objects during boolean operations.
