Add M_LIBRARY to libremrt.  BRLCAD_ADDLIB isn't used here because this library isn't installed and is only built as a static library - in the (relatively rare) cases in BRL-CAD where this is true we just use the raw cmake commands for library building rather than obfuscate the logic with more macros.
