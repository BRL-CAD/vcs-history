libpng-1.5.x is the current stable libpng series now.  Update to libpng 1.5.4, 'cause that's what all the cool kids are doing.  (API cleanup is a good thing, too...)  Starting with a vanilla check-in, will probably need to re-apply Makefile.am changes and will definitely need to port CMakeLists.txt changes forward.  Will be submitting the CMakeLists.txt changes back to see if we can get them included in the next version of libpng.
