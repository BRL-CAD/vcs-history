Updated functions 'nmg_class_pt_s', 'class_eu_vs_s' and 'class_fu_vs_s' within file 'nmg_class.c'. The changes will increase the speed in which nmg boolean operations are performed. For example, the mged command 'facetize' will run faster. The change adds a compare to the shell bounding box to exclude nmg objects (shell,face,loop,edge,vertex) as early as possible in the classification to prevent extra processing.
