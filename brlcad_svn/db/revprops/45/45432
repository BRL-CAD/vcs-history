Added a new function nmg_vsshell which validates the pointer structures within a single nmg shell structure and all structures within. The function nmg_vshell was changed to call the nmg_vsshell function. The function nmg_vshell is passed a list of shells to validate instead of a single shell. The purpose of this change is to allow a single nmg shell to be validated instead of all shells within an nmg model. The files raytrace.h and nmg_ck.c were changed.
