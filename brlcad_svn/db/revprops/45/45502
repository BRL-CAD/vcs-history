Updated the prototype version of function cut_unimonotone within file nmg_tri.c. This function supports the prototype version of function nmg_triangulate_fu. These prototype functions are disabled by default. This is a work is progress. Changed the test for an infinite loop and added more error checking. Also did code cleanup.
