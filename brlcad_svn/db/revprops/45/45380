Started rearranging things, to put translate/rotate/scale syntax handling in one place. Re-wrote proposed 'translate' manual per conversation with Sean. There were a couple more issues resolved and ideas added along the way. Next step is to ensure that rotate/scale will work alright with the same syntax.
