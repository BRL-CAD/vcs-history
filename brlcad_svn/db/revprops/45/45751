added simple support for the multi-sample framebuffer. I'm currently using the scanline array to hold the partial averages, but this is not good since it is a char array and many values will be truncated when I compute the next average. I think we must use a dedicated buffer to hold these averages. To test this mode, compile with -DEXPERIMENTAL_MODE
