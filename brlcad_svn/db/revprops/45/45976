Comparing the contents of argument heads with that of common->objects is an unsure way to end loops involving get_arg_head(). Instead, compare the address of common->objects with that of the argument heads. This is of greatest practical significant in batch operations, where it is possible for common->objects to be NULL, and therefore match the first NULL argument, which is not necessarily common->objects.
