Finished the edit_translate_add_cl_args() function (previously *_add_args()), so the logic of unique cmd-line args for that cmd are validated (needed 1 done to proceed with edit()). Added flagging of common options to ged_edt(); now, only cmd-specific options are recorded as chars. Since bug fix in r45733, I was able to start enabling/testing '.' batch operator(WIP). Also, made an alias of '--'. Trimmed long lines/comments. Removed dead code.
