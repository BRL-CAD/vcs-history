Translations to absolute coordinates are mostly working now, id est "translate 10 20 30 sphere.s". Ommitted coordinates are set to 0 for the time being; will be enabled once relative positioning is working. Fixed lots of small stuff that was causing big problems: return variables not being checked properly, vectors not being initialized, using a ptr where a ptr-to-ptr was needed, etc.
