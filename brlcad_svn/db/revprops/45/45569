Updated the prototype version of function bn_isect_line_lseg and bn_isect_line3_line3_new within the libbn library within file plane.c. These changes are disabled by default. These functions support the prototype function nmg_triangulate_fu. Made changes to code logic and performed code cleanup. This is a work in progress.
