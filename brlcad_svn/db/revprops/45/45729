Started on command-specific argument handling for translate, fixed some minor problems, and simplified some things. Need to have edit() add appropriate flags to command line args and remove command line character options from each arg's cl_options[] before I can continue. Tried to add this functionality in ged_edit() as it is originally adding the args, but it really needs to be done on a second loop, since the arguments before and after the current arg make a difference in how to apply the flags.
