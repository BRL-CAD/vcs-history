Changed the way that commands are added/stored, to use an array of structs similar to other command lists in BRL-CAD; much better. Set up ged_edit so that it behaves like a wrapper when the command name is not a ged_edit subcommand. Otherwise, when the command name is a ged_edit subcommand, it behaves as if it were the only command available. The syntax for some of the subcommands is pretty intense, so I also implemented a help system that displays the expanded syntax. Ex: "edit help", "edit help rotate" "rotate help", etc.
