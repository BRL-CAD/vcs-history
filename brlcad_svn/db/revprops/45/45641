got step-g to crash with a couple input test files, one crashing on Surface.h:48 implying some stack corruption or memory issue.  so add protections all the way up the stack to make sure we didn't run out of memory or dereference a null pointer at some point.  probably doesn't get to the heart of the crash, but should help isolate it and help halt sooner (and hopefully more gracefully than a crash).
