Renamed stupid "*_concise" functions to "*_wrapper". Added functions to get the next argument "head" in the union edit_cmd. Not too happy about adding yet another command-specific function; but it seems necessary to keep separation, while still having an intuitive way to build arguments (id est union edit_cmd). With these functions, we'll be able to pass over all of a command's arguments, without being aware of the union edit_cmd layout. The new plan is to keep edit() entirely command-agnostic. Certainly made adding another set of functions more palatable.
