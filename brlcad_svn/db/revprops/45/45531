Created a new prototype version of function bn_isect_line_lseg in the libbn library within file plane.c. This new version is disabled by default and exists to support the prototype version of nmg_triangulate_fu. The changes to this function were necessary to process the output from the prototype function bn_isect_line3_line3_new. This is a work in progress.
