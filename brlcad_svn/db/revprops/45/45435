Fixed a bug in function class_eu_vs_s within file nmg_class.c. The mid point of the edge was not computed correctly. I also used points near the vertices but still on the edge for the fallback if the mid point can not be classified. This change improves the success of nmg boolean operations and can be seen when running, for example, the mged 'facetize' and 'ev' commands.

END
