the osl-renderer now works with multiple osl shaders. Made several design changes to allow recursive rays... it now returns in the renderinfo struct information about the new ray that must be cast. the caller of the system must shoot the new ray. this is good because I imagine brl-cad shaders and osl shaders could be mixed. I've not tested this system with sh_osl, but rather osl_rt. on the other hand, I imagine the calling interface is essentially the same. So, in order to apply osl_rt, I need to discover how to initialize the shading system globally (not on sh_osl setup) and how to use shoot_ray
