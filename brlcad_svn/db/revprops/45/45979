During certain batch translations, objects after the first target object simply moved to the same location as the first target object. This was due to certain translation vectors not being recalculated after executing the first translation. Since information about an argument is lost after the first vector is calculated, there needs to be a new vector (and therefore struct edit_arg) for each translation.
