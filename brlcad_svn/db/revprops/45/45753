edit() will now "expand" batch operation args, by performing a deep copy of every target obj's edit_arg struct, consolidating option flags between the two as necessary. Added detection of keypoints missing their matching 'TO' arg, since every cmd should have that behavior. Replaced edit_arg_free_if_empty() with edit_arg_is_empty; a bit more versatile that way.
