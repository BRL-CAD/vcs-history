Tracked down an issue where the last object wasn't being added, and the last node in the linked list was empty. Added support for numeric args (as abs coord, rel pos, or obj offset). Added/renamed constants for specifying coordinates, so that significance goes from left to right: '%s/EDIT\([[:upper:]]\)_COORD/EDIT_COORD_\1/g'. Several smaller, formatting/comment corrections.
