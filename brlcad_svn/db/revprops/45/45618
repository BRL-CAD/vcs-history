apply sf patch 3376896 (All instances of SCLstring changed to std::string) from lainiwakurax.  patch converts scl converts almost all instances of SCLstring in SCL to standard STL strings.  tested minimally with a few ap203 conversions that all seemed to parse and convert equivalently.  outstanding.
