Updated the 'rt_ars_tess' function within file 'ars.c'. This change simplifies the 'ars' primitive geometry to improve the success of performing nmg boolean operations with 'ars' primitives. Commands such as mged 'facetize' will have greater success when the geometry to facetize contains 'ars' primitives.
