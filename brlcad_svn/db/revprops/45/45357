Updated functions 'nmg_two_face_fuse' and 'nmg_model_face_fuse' within file 'nmg_fuse.c'. These changes improve the fusing of coplanar faces during boolean operations of nmg objects. The changes can be seen on curved objects such as spheres which are not distorted due to improper face fusing. The changes effect functions such the mged 'facetize' and 'ev' commands.
