Retrieves correct tree to be edited:
A)If path's CWD isn't '/', the object's parent is retrieved so that the object's entry can be modified.
B)If the path is '/', the object (combination) itself is returned so that all instances of object are changed, by modifying it's entire tree.
All existing logic relating to this was moved to translate().
