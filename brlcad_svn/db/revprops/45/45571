Updated function class_eu_vs_s within file nmg_class.c. This change supports the prototype version of nmg_triangulate_fu. Made a logic change which stops the error message "class_eu_vs_s:  classifier found edge midpoint ON, edge topology should have been shared" when performing nmg boolean operations such as when running the mged 'facetize' or 'ev' commands. This change is disabled by default. This is a work in progress.
