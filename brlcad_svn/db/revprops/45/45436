Updated the prototype version of the function cut_unimonotone within file nmg_tri.c. This is a work in progress and this change is disabled by default. Some code cleanup was done and the ability to reverse the direction of loopuse was added to correct situations after a loop cut that the direction reverses i.e. is cw and should be ccw. This change supports the prototype version of the function nmg_triangulate_fu.

END
