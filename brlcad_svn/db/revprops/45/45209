remove all of the B U _ expanded function names.  it helped find API functions in the source files where they were mixed with implementation code, but in the header, it's all API.  moreover, it makes our documenting job harder since it prevents auto-brief (recognition of the first line/sentance as a brief description).  with the title removed, we can remove all of the @brief markers too.
