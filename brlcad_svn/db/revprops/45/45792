initial implementation of a new procedural geometry generator that makes menger sponges.  menger sponges are sierpinski carpet patterns in 3d.  this implementation supports creating the normal 'inside' subtraction patterns as well as inverted 'outside' subtraction patterns.  there are also options to only perform the patterns along specified xyz axes.  this test case was written as a means to test/compare performance of arb8+csg evaluation against evaluated bot and evaluated NURBS representations, as well as being a solid test of n-manifold conversion logic.
