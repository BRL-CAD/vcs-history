Updated functions 'vertex_neighborhood', 'ray_hit_vertex', 'isect_ray_faceuse', 'guess_class_from_hitlist_max', 'guess_class_from_hitlist_min' and 'nmg_class_ray_vs_shell' within file 'nmg_rt_isect.c'. Most of the changes support the prototype version of the function 'nmg_triangulate_fu'. The remaining changes are code cleanup. The logic changes are disabled by default and are a work in progress. These changes are related to classification of nmg objects during boolean operations.
