Implemented mechanism for reading multiple subarguments per option and lists of arguments for edit subcommands. Objects are currently the only type of argument supported, but the logic to add additional parsing capabilities is in place. Generic option handling works fairly well now, and provides good feedback to the user about bad option/argument combinations as well as possible without knowing the syntax of a given command. The syntax of -k/-a/-r options and -x/-y/-z suboptions are standardized, and intentionally not changable on a per-command basis. All unrecognized options are simply stored for later processing on a per-command basis. The next step is to add additional argument parsing capabilities to edit_str_to_arg(). Then it's off to edit() to check that the argument grouping and order makes sense for the given command, expand the batch character('.'), translate objects/offsets/relative positions into absolute coordinates, and any other command-specific prep, before handing off to the command.
