simplify bu_getprogname().  forget about trying to cash the progname result and just re-evaluate the name again.   this is necessary anyways in case the caller repeatedly calls bu_setprogname() with different values.  also add protection from bu_basename() which will return '.' or '/' for some strings and that's not very useful.
