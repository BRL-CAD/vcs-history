how about this.  cliff and bob improved mged/archer/bwish run-time behavior on windows by fixing bu_basename() to work with the windows path separator.  this low-level interface is used for capturing the path to the running executable, data resources, and more; so fixing the routine should generally make things better, making apps more consistent for windows users.
