Relative and absolute translations of single objects is now working, as is using a default of the bounding box center of objects or option -k to set keypoints. Objects and numbers are now working for all arguments, as well. Using the apparent coordinates of objects (i.e. translate -k a/very/specific/instance/of/shp.s -a 0 17 2.3 shp2.s) is working somewhat, but is off a bit in many cases. Specifiying coordinates/objects with -x/-y/-z is not working at the moment. Using the batch operator when translating a single object already works (i.e. translate -k 4 -a . obj), and accepting the batch operator and multiple objects to translate is close to working.
