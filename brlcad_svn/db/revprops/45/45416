from mpictor's commit fixing a crash from newer versions of flex, https://github.com/mpictor/StepClassLibrary/commit/37ac5dc82f6da91a62a39596ad0582649fce91a6; which is from a gentoo spim patch, which seems to have originated from a fedora patch.  apparently yy_init was changed from meaning 'needs to be initialized' to 'was initialized', effectively flipping the boolean meaning.
