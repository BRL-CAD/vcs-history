Initializing cur_arg pointer to wrong value after freeing, resulted in stepping over two nodes in linked list rather than one.  Missing braces for if statements causing havoc. Attempt to free a shallow copy of a union edit_cmd (wasn't causing any problems though, since its contents were first replaced with NULL pointers, which was detected by the freeing function and therefore nothing was freed). Simplified and clarified a few other small things. Still some problems with multiple -x/-y/-z uses in a single argument.
