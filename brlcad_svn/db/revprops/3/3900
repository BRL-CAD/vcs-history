Implemented a new meaning to a_onehit:  how many hit points
need to be accurately determined.
This provides a big performance "win" to the reflect/refract code,
which needs 3 hits, and was forced to compute the ray to +infinity,
which was *very* costly.

Alas, somehow I seem to have made things in general slow down.
The larger the model, the worse it gets.
This must be pursued further.
