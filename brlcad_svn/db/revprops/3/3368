Fixed bug in reversal of wn (the algorithm requires that this have
whatever sign the cross product gives it).
Added code to break up four and five vertex polys into triangles
(this assumes that the poly is convex).
Added vector reversal in the normal routine based on ray direction
(this is not officially "correct" but it at least allows the rendering
of polygons until we get "plate mode polys" or some such implemented).

END
