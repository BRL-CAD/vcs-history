Moved merging st_regions[] into regionbits[] from rt_shootray(),
where it was being done once for all regions crossed by a ray,
into rt_boolfinal(), where it is now built separately for each
partition.

In models where the ray may traverse quite a few regions, this
should result in a substantial savings, mostly from less calling
of rt_booleval().

END
