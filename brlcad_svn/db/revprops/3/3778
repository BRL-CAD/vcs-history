Added a new "closing" state, so that if the decision is made to drop
a server in the middle of several back-to-back packages, all the
state of the package library isn't yanked out from under it while
deeply recursed.
This prevents REMRT from dumping core when the XMP blasts us with
a batch of crappy packages.
