First cut at working pan and zoom.  We now allocate a scanline
XImage buffer for zoomed repaints.  Currently only works in
'm' 24bit store mode.  Needs some cleanup/reorganization.
Added single-button-mouse remapping.  Fixed [s]cursor to actually
do screen/memory locations.  Neatened colormap file hack.
todo - libfb colormap repaints, better scanwrite hack, 6x6x6 cube.

END
