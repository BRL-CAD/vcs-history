Fixed the material id lookup logic to check for a reg_mater entry with
mid=<digits> as part of the parameter string.  If found, this is used
as the material id rather than looking in reg_gmater.
This capability allows material id to be inherited from groups downward
rather than necessitating creating super-regions.
