Includes changes in how MGED colors the various solids.
Externally, the color selection now matches that used by RT.
Internally, this was accomplished by adding 3 more fields
to the solid table (s_basecolor[], s_color[], s_dmindex),
and eliminating the mt_dm_int value from the region-id-based
material table.
