report from bob anderson of g_lint not working on windows, almost certainly because there is no /tmp directory.  use the TMP/TEMP environment variable and make sure we're running out bu_brlcad_root version of g_lint.  add .exe for good measure, but probably unnecessary here because 'open' does the right thing and searches PATH (whereas exec does not?).  iterating with user to test.
END
