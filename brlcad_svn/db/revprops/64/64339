Fix the Archer command entry so saveview can be run with its full range of arguments. By default saveview uses the name of the open database in the script. This is a problem in Archer because the open database is a working copy, which means it's deleted on program exit, invalidating the script. Address this by silently passing the name of the original database to saveview if the input database isn't specified by the user. There's still a problem in that if a user creates a saveview script based on the working copy and doesn't save changes back to the original database, then the saveview script may still be invalid. For now though, possibly invalid is better than always invalid.
