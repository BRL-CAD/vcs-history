Trying to think ahead a little - generalize the triangulation calls so we don't need to introduce new functions even if we introduce options for triangulation algorithms.  There are a number of these with different trade-offs, but they have (mostly) the same inputs and outputs - try to make the API ready for that now instead of having to alter it down the road.
