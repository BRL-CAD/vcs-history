revert c58024.  the HAVE_WORKING_* tests are only run when we're compiling strict which means we lose all the provided functionality (like hostname reporting).  plus, they introduce a new convention in the caller code that complicates usage (HAVE_* is already supposed to imply whether it's available for use, i.e., working).  we may need to introduce HAVE_DECL_* ammendments where an interface is available but not declared due to mode of compilation.
