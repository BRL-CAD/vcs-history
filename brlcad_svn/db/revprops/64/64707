Looking at the rtg3 issue, and from there into icv, we need better file extension extraction code.  Setting this up in libbu as a general functionality before porting icv to it.  Model the functionality on the get_filename_component feature of CMake, although we handle things like absolute path elsewhere so we're using only a subset of their options.
