Add the vanilla Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction Version 6.13 sources from http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Code/PoissonRecon/Version6.13 (the latest as of April 10, 2015.)  The only change from the original zip file contents was to correct mixed line endings in a few Src files so subversion would accept the files.
END
