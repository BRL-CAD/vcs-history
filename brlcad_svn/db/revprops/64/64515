Try to find the greatest distance from the plane to an arc midpoint and use that for our testing - needed if we have multiple cylinder pieces making up a shape.  Also, use the resulting distance to try and reign in the length of the subtraction arb8 primitives a bit.  Doesn't do anything about their width, which is also possible in theory, but it's a start.
