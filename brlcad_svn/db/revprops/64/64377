We were assuming that isocurve intersections along surface edges had to be part of the boundary of a surface overlap, but this is not true when two surfaces intersect /only/ at their edges, as in the case of two planar surface meeting in an 'L'. We have to do the full overlap boundary test every time to categorize isocurve intersections correctly. Previously, isocurve intersections that weren't determined to be part of an overlap boundary were discarded, to be reconstructed later. Trying to solve an isocurve intersection from intersection points discovered during general surface-surface intersection doesn't work well, especially when the isocurves are at the edges of the surface, so as with r64233, we'll opt to retain the non-overlap-boundary isocurve intersections and report them as-is.
