make a line/plane intersect function in openNURBS data types.  Easier to read and use, fixes some issues with NIST 2.  Needs much more careful/rigorous testing, but as of this commit all 5 raytraces, CSG only and CSG/NURBS combinations, from a casual visual inspection don't appear to contain any major errors.
