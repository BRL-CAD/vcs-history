update most of libfb and all callers to size_t for image sizing.  this has a benefit of not permitting or needing to check for negative values.  it has a risk that some loop construct wasn't properly updated or some tool actually relied on negative coordinates.  however, ran a number of manual tests, all fb-related regressions and integration tests are passing, and build is clean (mac, clang6).
