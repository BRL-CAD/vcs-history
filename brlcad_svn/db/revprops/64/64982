symmetry.  rename libgm to libbg.  similar to our basic utility and basic numeric libs, this describes a library scope for 'basic geometry'.  add benefit is that it also doesn't seem to have any notable use (actually even less use than gm).  scope still needs more rigorous definition to avoid scope creep, but notionally seems to be unstructured geometry entities that can be statically defined (and non-variadic, finite).
