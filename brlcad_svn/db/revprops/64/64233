Trying to find a surface-surface intersection curve involving an isocurve by fitting to solved points doesn't work well when both surfaces are planar. In this case the intersection should have been found during isocurve-surface intersections, and we can just make the intersection event from the unclosed isocurve intersection and skip trying to solve for other points.
