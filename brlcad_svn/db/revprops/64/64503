This appears to get the right basic shapes in place for the makerbot replicator object Boss-Extrude1_008.s, but the booleans are out of wack (not surprising, as this is a negative planar_object and up until now the logic contemplated positive shapes.  May also need a correction in the cyl/arb logic, not sure yet.
