Added getSurfacePoint() that uses the bounding volumes along with the 
Newton iterate to find the surface UV of a point on the surface.
Fixed getCurveEstimateOfV() for decreasing 't' ranges.
Added getLeavesBoundingPoint() function to BVNode to return bounding 
leafs that contain the point.
Initialized m_face to NULL for all BVNode constructors.
Set fuzz on  m_node.m_min,m_max for all BVNode constructors.
Forced recursion of BuildBox() for non-leaf nodes.
Added 'removeTrimmed' boolean to surface subdivision tree as a means to 
tell the routines to not discard known trimmed nodes(tree needed by STEP 
before trims are assigned).
