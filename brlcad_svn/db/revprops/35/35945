bob fixed a bug when raytracing an object that is displayed for editing within a given subpath context (e.g. draw all.g/cone.r ; rt).  the display lists weren't being tracked as pathed objects, only lists of solids.  now they're tracked as display lists that refers to what the user asked for, each path with its own solids list.
