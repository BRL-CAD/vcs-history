Add the skeleton for a csgbrep proc-db - eventually this will be used to do examples of all of the primitives going from an implicit to a NURBS representation.  At the moment it looks like the ability to do this is not yet set up, so need to wire in the rt_*_brep ability to some sort of public API.
