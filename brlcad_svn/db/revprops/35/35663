really crude initial support for antialiasing.  there are currently two horribly inefficient methods, including one that doesn't even really work yet.  the one that doesn't work, uses 4x4 sub-pixel sampling to determine edge contributions within that cell.  the one that does work (poorly) only compares a local sub-sample to the neighboring full-sample pixel cells.  they're horribly inefficient as they merely shoot additional rays to determine that cell's intensity contribution.
