Get some of the 'easy' csg-brep added - these primitives will just convert to nmg and use that routine.  ars has some longer term interesting possibilities, but for replicating existing surfaces this should do OK.  ebm, which fundamentally uses pixels and has square edges (however small) should also be a fairly clean if fairly massive workable nmg conversion.
