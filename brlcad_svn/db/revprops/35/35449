make sure the ITCL_LIB_FILE has the appropriate filename suffix.  the .a suffix is wrong as you cannot package require those. alas we cannot seemingly use tcl's SHLIB_SUFFIX variable since it's not available (as are the other TCL_SHLIB_SUFFIX and similar vars).  instead put a horrible platform hack so we can acommodate mac's dylib suffix.  this definitely needs improvement but will hopefully go away when we can call incrTcl's configure with the upcoming 4.0 release.
