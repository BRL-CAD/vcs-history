part is and has always been a stupid short name for the 'particle' primitive, which was also a bad name idea.  v6 needs to fix that by minimally renaming it to something less confusing, like 'pill' or by implementing a more generalized metaprimitive structure for supporting constraint object combinations like 'part'.
