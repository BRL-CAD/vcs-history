Start cleaning up the opennurbs tree building routines/logic.  Would prefer the flatness test to be a per-node affair (like, say, isLeaf) but need to hit my head on it a bit more first.  For the time being, since there is still active debugging going on with indianlarry and this approach is not yet functional, sticking it into two temporary files that are EXTRA_DISTed.  Once the trees are building successfully in testing, see about rewiring brep.cpp to use the different tree structure.
