this is cool.  bob implemented support for sub-object erasures where you can d/erase an object within a currently displayed object.  it will expand the display list to the list of sub-objects still currently displayed (e.g. e all.g; d all.g/platform.r; who; and it'll report all.g/cone.r all.g/light.r, etc).
