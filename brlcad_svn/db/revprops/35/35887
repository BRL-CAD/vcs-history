in rt_pipe_adjust() an only temporary invalid pipe segment will not be considered as an error any more (reword for brevity, release prep, revision 35879).  this addresses a problem reported by randerson303 on discussion forum where a g2asc+asc2g would fail with a bot outer diameter must be larger than inner diameter error.
