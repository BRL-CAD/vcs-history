thanks to a report from Wim Bokkers, sf # 2822415 (rtweight crashes on Windows), rtweight should no longer crash on windows or elsewhere.  the problem was an assumption in rtweight's view_init() that the HOME and PWD environment variables are always set.  When they are unset, we end up with null pointer dereferences and crashing.
