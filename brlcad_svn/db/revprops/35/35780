if LIBGL is '' and we happen to be on a system that will conviently link opengl when the user provides LIBS=-lGL, this test will incorrectly succeed for the WindowsGL interface.  Add a wgl-specific call that should hopefully work fine, namely calling wglMakeCurrent() with NULL parameters.  needs testing on windows, obviously.
