reword as it wasn't added to mged...  stephen 'el magnifico' kennedy wrote a procedural human geometry generator (called 'human') that was added to archer.  in addition to a command-line command, there's an initial (possibly non-functioning) archer plugin gui too.  implemented with bob's help of course.
