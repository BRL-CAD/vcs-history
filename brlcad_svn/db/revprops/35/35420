add a BC_CONFIG_COMPLETE macro that is used in conjunction with BC_CONFIG_CACHE to let it know that configure completed successfully.  BC_CONFIG_COMPLETE must be called before AC_OUTPUT because it sets a cache value that is read looked for during the next run.  this implements sf feature request 2828793 from matt_chan (RFE: delete configure cache on failed run).
