increase the maximum ogl framebuffer size from the previous 1280x1024 to 16384x16384 (non-trivial to allow unbounded).  moreover, eliminate the odd shared memory break code that was in place for irix 4 and earlier.  this should fix a problem I ran into where I couldn't fb-fb from a large X framebuffer to an ogl one.
