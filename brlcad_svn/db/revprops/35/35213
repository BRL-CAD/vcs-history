OK, have a working raytrace where some parameter passing is taking place.  Does not produce the dramatic speedup seen elsewhere, possibly due to my replicating the existing flatness test point selection rather than the 'clever' choice.  Since there is a slight speedup (a about 10 seconds out of a minute and a half prep) I'll go ahead and commit, with an eye  towards further optimization later.
