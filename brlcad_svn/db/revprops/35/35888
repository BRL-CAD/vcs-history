Even though proe spits out left-hand rule triangles, set things back to have "no" orientation in case proe ever spits out a mixed bag of left and right hand triangles. While we're at it, since proe seems to be spitting out left-hand rule triangles (i.e. clockwise), reverse this to be right-hand rule (i.e. counter-clockwise) so that shaded-mode works properly without having to run bot_flip.
