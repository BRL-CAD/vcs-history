add a proper --enable-rtgl flag to configure that will enable/disable compilation of the new rtgl dm interface.  it's still tied to opengl (which is presently defaulted off), so you have to specify --with-opengl too.  intentionally did not assign aliases or add to enable-all as a) it's still under development, b) it needs more work at least to not hang drawing, and c) there still needs to be a way to turn all the dm/fb's on/off consistently with separation from their external deps.
