Removed a call that was causing Ogre to go through a full render sequence (undesirable, as it involves buffer flipping and possibly 
other actions based on the assumption that Ogre is the only user of the context), and disabled Ogre rendering altogether to test Qt 
operation with a custom event loop (successful).

END
