Added code to split up a display list if part of the list is no longer being displayed. That is, if "all.g" which contains "tor.r", "box.r", "platform.r", "cone.r", "ellipse.r" and "light.r" was originally being display and "all/tor.r" was removed from the display then the display list for "all" would be split up into the following new lists: "all.g/box.r", "all.g/platform.r", "all.g/cone.r", "all.g/ellipse.r" and "all.g/light.r".
END
