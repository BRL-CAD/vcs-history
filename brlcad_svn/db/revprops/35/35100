Ah HAH.  Fix the flatness test to use corner and interior points the way the old setup did (even though the interior points are a bit different.)  Appears to fix the visual flaws from the default rt view, but the strange symmetrical dot lines in the top down view (that disappear on zoom in) are still there.
