Working pushbutton overlayed!  Something about manually setting the size of the OgreGLWidget with ->resize(1024, 768); threw it off; my 
guess is that my (tiling) wm's enforced resize produced a layout that resulted in the widget being offscreen.  It may be worth testing 
previously failed options with said resize call removed.
