Ah.  Need to subdivide even flat nurbs surfaces in order to assign small subsets of the trimming curves to small areas of the nurbs surface for evaluation purposes.  I wonder, would it be 'cleaner', in cases like this, to do some sort of test of points against the curve tree?  i.e. for a uv point, if inside the uv bounds of a node, find subnodes that it is inside of, repeat until leaf node(s) are found, then work on the leaf nodes?  Probably more expensive for a trimming test, but avoids breaking up flat surfaces.
