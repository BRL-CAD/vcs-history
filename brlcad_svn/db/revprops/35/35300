improve the opengl header tests (which were not working correctly on Mac OS X 10.4) to go through AC_CHECK_HEADER instead of being custom AC_COMPILE_IFELSE tests.  opengl functionality tests occur later on.  set GL_CPPFLAGS instead of GL_CFLAGS for the header search paths to be consistent/pedantic.
