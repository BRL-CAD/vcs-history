add a '-a' option to mged that allows users to specify a display manager to attach to.  this avoids the attach prompting seen in interactive mode that should help systems that prompt for an attach device even when non-interactive.  expand the docs with examples including filling in details on the -d display option as well.  note that you cannot (presently) invoke multiple attachments due to the way display manager creation is presently deferred without a little restructuring.
