document the new antialias/aa and both_sides/bs options to rtarea.  while antialias is still a WIP and experimental, the basic framework is in place and the two options play well together.  need to make the framework more generalized, though, so better filter processing can occur.  also fix the manual page for rtedge which looked to be missing the end quotes for all options.
