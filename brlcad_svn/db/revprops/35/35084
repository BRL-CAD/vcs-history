apply a simple patch that should hopefully fix sf bug 2820579, reported by Jeff Meldrum (jspaces) regarding a const to non-const conversion.  according to a handful of online sources, c++ apparently changes the signature of strrchr from the posix C decl with two overloaded possibilities, both input and return are either const or non-const.
