Switched to a custom mainloop which instructs Ogre not to swap the OpenGL buffers, because Qt presumably does this.  While it has not been determined whether Qt's buffer swap occurs at the right time, this has a promising side effect: a corner of the render window contains a block of white, the default background color of Qt's rendering.
