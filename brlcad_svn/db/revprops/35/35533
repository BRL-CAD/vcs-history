Adds a new class to keep track of intersections between ON_BrepFaces. These classes record the intersection curves, segment the curves based on the trimming curves of the faces they came from, and slates the trim curves that got intersected for destruction. Also adds in the functionality needed to sort curves by start and end point and so that they can be matched and reconstructed in to trims.
