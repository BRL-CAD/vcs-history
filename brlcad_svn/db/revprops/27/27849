add at least three (rather minor, all with workarounds) bugs noticed relating to libfb/ray-tracer file redirection.  libfb cannot utilize standard output/error 'device' files (e.g. /dev/stdout) without path trickery, using such a device fails if used with a pipe or redirect, and the ray-tracers output corrupted imagery if using -o to a non-seekable file (like /dev/stdout).
