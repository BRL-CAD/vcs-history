complete rewrite of the auto_path handling code in support of the forthcoming tcl/tk upgrade (8.5a5).  the logic is entirely changed so that less arbitrary searching is performed.  now the routine attempts to detect whether it's being run from a source directory or from an installed location, and allowing TCLCAD_LIBRARY_PATH to be obeyed for additional paths.  this needs tweaking/testing on other platforms, but the overall approach is a vast improvement to the previous.
