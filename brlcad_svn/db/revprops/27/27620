john continued to rock when he wrote bu_fgets() to allow automatic cross-platform line handling ala fgets(), which doesn't necessarily handle all of the various line endings that can be encountered (CR, LF, and CR/LF being the predominant ones).  in particular, this fix addresses a bug that was reported on windows with dxf-g parsing files from another platform incorrectly.  note the fix as it applies to dxf-g at least.
