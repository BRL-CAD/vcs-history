john fixed the bug where the dxf-g converter was improperly handling files encoded with a different line ending style (e.g. CR+NL or CR only).  this was done by implementing bu_fgets() that takes CR's into account.  still need to test more and probably update all of the callers of fgets() but it's there now.
