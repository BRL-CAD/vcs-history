mged help command now shows help for all args listed.  this fixes a bug with the 'help' command where issuing something like 'helpdevel aip hist' would report the non-existance of the 'aip hist' command.  now correctly returns the help for all listed individually as was documented.  this issue was reported by an analyst at arl.
