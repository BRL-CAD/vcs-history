add support for arbitrary matrix transformations to torus primitive .. while there's certainly question on what this means to the mathematics of the implicit form (they're no longer mathematically a torus), the underlying modeling capacity is still needed and storing a transformation matrix or at least scaling vectors in the primitive (or above the primitive) would go a long way to handling this somewhat unique case.
