update all usages of fgets() to instead use john's swanktastic bu_fgets() that behaves as one would generally want regardless of the line ending type of the compilation platform or of the input files.  bu_fgets() responds to input files that use CR (usually old mac), LF (usually unix, new mac), or CR/LF (usually windows) for the line ending so now these file do too effectivley squashing buggish/bad behavior.
