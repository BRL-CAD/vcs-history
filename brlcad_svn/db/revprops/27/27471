remove the png headers from our include directory.  png_cppflags are now provided by configure and appropriately set to src/other/libpng if we're not using a system libpng.  this should help to avoid header conflicts aside from just unnecessarily duplicating 3rd party headers. use the new png_cppflags as appropriate, though have to add it to _CFLAGS since per target _CPPFLAGS support wasn't added until automake 1.7 (and brl-cad allows anything 1.6.0+).
