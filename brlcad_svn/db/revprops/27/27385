restructure the X11 checks so that if --without-x11 is provided, all of the associated x11 checks are also disabled as well so we don't waste time testing for things that will not be used.  similarly, don't auto-add /usr/X11R6 to the search paths or add the extra restart paths unless we're in automatic or yes mode
