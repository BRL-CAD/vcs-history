Pedantic licensing update to retract the "BSD Advertising Clause", i.e. clause 3 of the original 4-clause BSD license.  As granted by William Hoskins, Director to the Office of Technology Licensing at the University of California, Berkeley, update the license on code copyrighted by Berkeley to retract the advertising clause.  See ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change for details.
