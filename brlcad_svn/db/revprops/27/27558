compensate for an autoconf inconsistency issue where apparently newer 2.60+ autoconf is setting datadir to datarootdir as a default, causing a need to evaluate datadir before using it with things like AC_DEFINE and AC_SUBST values.  do an explicit eval echo like is done for the summary printing.

thanks to IriX64 for noticing the problem and helping pinpoint the cause.  the problem affected most BRLCAD_DATA installation paths as well as awf and brlman (which use BRLCAD_DATA).
