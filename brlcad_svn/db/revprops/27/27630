bu_getprogname seems to be behaving now, so use it for selection of the executable name unless it does return null for some reason -- then default back to just 'mged'. try (again?) to set auto_path before Tcl_Init since we need to set up auto_path before init so the scripts, including init.tcl, can be found.
