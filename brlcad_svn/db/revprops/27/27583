AM_PROG_CC_STD was deprecated and later made obsolete by automake 1.8 with the functionality merged into AC_PROG_CC.  the macro attempted to ensure that the compiler is running in 'ansi mode'.  add AM_PROG_CC_C_O to handle compilation of non-libtool stuff with compilers that don't happen to support the common -c -o syntax.  latest automake seems to be complaining about the option being missing/needed (reported by IriX64) during autogen.sh.
