fix a bug, or at least really bad behavior, where calling up the wireframe of a dsp that failed to load any data would cause the app (mged) to abort.  the abort was due to a BU_CK_MAPPED_FILE that was occurring before an already existing check for whether the data was valid.  reordered correctly, and updated the error message to say what wasn't found so the user might have an idea of what to look for.

END
