major rewrite, add support for -s, -l, and -i options for silent, verbose output (ala cmp's -l option), and support for skipping input.  make the return/error codes more uniform as well as more detail on the usage.  still need to actually add the print statement for -l, but everything else should be done.  basic operation and previous use remains unaffected.

END
