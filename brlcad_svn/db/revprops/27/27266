awesome.. not only did karel (aka clock3) identify and report on an animation bug in rt with extensive detail, he went on to trace down the problem and actually identified the bug.  a variable that keeps track of frame progress was not being reset to null after a frame was completed causing subsequent frames to dereference an invalid pointer and segfault.  apply the fix from sf bug 1629285 (persistent segfaults during animation - with a fix). this affected all raytracers, but not library users.  excellent work, karel.  excellent.
