erik fixed rtedge multithreaded output render bug reported by clock3 aka Karel Kulhavy (sf bug 1657171 - 7.8.4. rtedge renders bullshit).  the problem was a race condition when rendering in parallel on output to a file that would cause scanlines to be written to file out-of-order.  a modification was made to have file output wait for each line in order before writing.
