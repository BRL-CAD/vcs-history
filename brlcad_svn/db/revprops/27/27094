get rid of the _WIN32 sections for recv/send instead of read/write .. this really shouldn't be necessary if the compatibility macros in the config_win.h header are specified correctly, but for now keep it as it is just without all the repetition by using macros that call the corresponding routine.  oh yeah, and M-x indent-region ws too.
