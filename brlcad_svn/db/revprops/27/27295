Updated the remaining remnants of the original BSD license from libtermlib and libregex as part of a pedantic licensing update to retract the 'BSD Advertising Clause', i.e. clause 3 of the original 4-clause BSD license.  This change was granted by William Hoskins, Director to the Office of Technology Licensing at the University of California, Berkeley.  The license on code copyrighted by Berkeley (as well as code that had updates from other contributors but that exempted clause 3) may have the advertising clause removed due to the explicit permission given by Hoskins to retract the requirement.  See ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change for details.
