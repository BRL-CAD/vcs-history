restructure library linkages so that brl-cad libraries no longer list their dependencies as a LIBADD.  dependencies are moved into configure.ac and provided via _LIBS variables so that they are specified at link time.  this supports hybrid static library compilation as well as other more varied mixture configurations.  use the new _LIBS variables throughout.  probably want to re-combine them later into a single symbol name per library but this will suffice for now.
