change the way COPYING and INSTALL are protected from being clobbered by automake's stupid behavior of overwriting our files with generic GNU content.  instead of saving a backup to a file in the aux dir, save the contents of the file to memory (that is even preserved across internal restarts).  restore as needed if/when the content is clobbered.
