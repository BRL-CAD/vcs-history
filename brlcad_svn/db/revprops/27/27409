This script updates a given set of files (or most all files in this
project) with consistent whitespace formatting.  The script can be run
on individual files or in batch mode, and is intended to be run
periodically to help ensure consistent formatting.  Currently, the
following actions are performed by default (but can be selected
individually at run-time):

  a) removes whitespace on lines that only have whitespace.
  b) removes whitespace at the end of any line.
  c) removes successive blanks lines so there are no more than two
    in a row anywhere in a given file.  WS_SUCCESSIVE=2
  d) removes all blank lines at the end of a file.
  e) ensures that there is a newline at the end of file.
  f) expand embedded tabs to spaces.
  g) unexpands leading whitespace and tabs, inserting tabs at the
     default system tabstops.  WS_TABSTOPS=8
  *) show progress.  WS_PROGRESS=yes
  *) keep backups if a change is made.  WS_BACKUPS=yes
