make autogen.sh now report a version number based on the last commit date as well as an auto-extracted copyright range.  turn the version error reporting into a function so it can be updated in one place and fix/remove the trailing _SH that didn't belong.  add comments at the beginning of each of the manual steps.  when stashing COPYING and INSTALL in memory, make sure they actually fit -- irix seems to have issues.
