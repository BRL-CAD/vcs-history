major update.  this change adds support for protected recursive build preparations, saving copies of all the relevant COPYING/INSTALL files that might get stomped on by automake/autoreconf (EVEN WHEN USING AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS).  the files are even still stashed into memory too by using tricksy path-specific variables.  this fix will restore the files correctly regardless of whether autoreconf or manual steps are taken.  t'is a royal hassle just to compensate for automake's bad behavior, but it at least all seems to be working well.
