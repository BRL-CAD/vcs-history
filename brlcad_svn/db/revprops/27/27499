either PNG_NO_MMX_CODE or PNG_NO_ASSEMBLER_CODE are required for successful compilation on AMD64 Linux with gcc due to linking of 32-bit assembly with 64-bit object files.  compiling with -m32 avoids the problem but just tack on PNG_NO_MMX_CODE for now since that doesn't limit compilation/features like the other two options.  should probably test for this mix in configure and set some cppflags accordingly.
