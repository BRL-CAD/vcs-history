Finally isolated the problem where certain operations in the mged command window will result in the input prompt getting in front of 'mged>' prompt.  the problem turns out to be various default scrolling text widget bindings that modify the cursor input position, including page up/down.  fix is simple, just do the same binding operation but don't move the cursor.
