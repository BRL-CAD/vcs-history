hmm.. such a conundrum.. it is nice to clean up and blow away the aclocal.m4 that configure drops in but now that recursive configure works, tcl/tk actually use their own custom aclocal.m4 (instead of acinclude.m4) so deleting the file has undesireable impact on build prep.  disable aclocal.m4 deletion for now.
