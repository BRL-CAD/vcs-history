there does seem to be a ray-trace consistency failure in the solids.sh regression test case where it fails on Mac OS X with one pixel exhibiting an off-by-many error on the edge of the middle ARB8.  this only seems to occur when using an optimized -O3 compile (and using -fno-unsafe-math-optimizations seems to make no difference) possibly indicating a floating point/tolerance issue that needs to be accounted for so that results are exactly repeatable regardless.
