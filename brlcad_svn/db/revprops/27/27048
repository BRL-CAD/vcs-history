bu_prmem() was printing the number of available slots in the memory debug
table.  This was easily mis-interpreted as the number of memory allocations.
Since this is a diagnostic for how the memory debug table is being manipulated
and not something the average user/programmer wants to see, the value
was removed from bu_prmem()'s output.  Minor benefit:  The table now prints
one less line, so output is more compact.
