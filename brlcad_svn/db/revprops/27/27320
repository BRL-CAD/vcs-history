this fixes a compilation/linking issue involving the new C++ openNURBS library integration.  it accounts for bad behavior in pre 1.5.8 libtool where the generated libtool script would contain an -all_load directive on the linker line for libraries that use convenience libraries as part of the whole_archive_flag_spec.  that flag in turn causes gcc to fail with various errors on duplicate standard math and io symbols.  the libtool script is simply stripped of the -all_load directive, which causes libtool to correctly just include all the convenience libraries and link the objects manually.  this problem was specific to the default libtool (1.5) provided on mac os x (10.4).
