according to one of the tcl devs (thx jenglish), Tk_IsMapped() is not what we should be using to determine if the tkwin is 'valid' .. being 'mapped' apparently means that there is a window that has been explicitly mapped via a Tk_MapWindow() call or is otherwise fully drawn/displayed.  fall back to a simple non-null check instead.
