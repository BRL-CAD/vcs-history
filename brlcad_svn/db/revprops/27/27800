massive restructuring of the code.  functions are defined in visibility order so declarations are unnecessary, functions are made static so they don't collide with librt's similar (but not identical) importFg4Section.c symbols (Add_bot_face, do_trid, do_quad, and do_tri functions; grid_pts variable), rename aforementioned and others with an f4_ prefix just to entirely avoid the naming confusion, reorder macros, defines, static vars, and functions into sections, and of course massive ws update while we're at it.
