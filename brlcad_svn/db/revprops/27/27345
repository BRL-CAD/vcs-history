add support to detect/convert \a9 copyright symbols, convert them to (c) for consistency just like everything else. also, more importantly, add the ability to use this script to process individual files (e.g. in conjunction with find).  if there's an argument list, that is what will be processed.  otherwise, it will do the usual task of processing everything under the src root that it recognizes (and that isn't exempted).
