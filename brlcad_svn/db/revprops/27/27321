this fixes another compilation/linking issues involving the new C++ openNURBS library integration. added is a check for the -fexceptions gcc compiler/linker flag that takes care of an unresolved __Unwind_Resume symbol error when linking rttherm (quite odd that only rttherm seems to provoke that symbol being undefined).  the symbol relates to exception handling support in gcc that would otherwise be provided if linking with g++.  could also have probably added the -shared-libgcc flag as well for the same result.  thanks to Andrew Pinski for this particular fix.
