john's bu_fgets() fun and my update to the various tools that needed it ends up improved the end-of-line (EOL) processing in about 70+ tools.  basically any command that read in a text file using fgets().  this fix is particularly relevant for running our tools on windows where data files are frequently migrated from the unix/linux/max side without a line-ending conversion.
