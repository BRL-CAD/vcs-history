account for a new tcl/itcl interaction bug caused by the upgrade to 8.5, first reported by alice and soon after by john, whereby tcl panics and aborts mged when you call up the combination editor or other incrtcl interface widget.  upon further investigation, patches are made to both tcl and incrtcl to 1) not panic as the check is bogus/inappropriate at that place in tcl (body is empty and marked as such) and 2) actually provide a compiled body pointer (which is what it was aborting on) just with an empty string (idea extracted from code already in incrtcl cvs).  either fix alone takes care of the problem but we apply to both so we can work with combinations of system or compiled tcl and itcl.  woot, that was the last issue holding up release...
