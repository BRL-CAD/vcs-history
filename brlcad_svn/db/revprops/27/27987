Finally isolated the problem where certain operations in the mged command window will result in the input prompt getting in front of 'mged>' prompt.  the problem turns out to be various default scrolling text widget bindings that modify the cursor input position.  there's a whole list of such bindings, but without testing this update just lists them and overrides the two that were obvious (page up/down).
