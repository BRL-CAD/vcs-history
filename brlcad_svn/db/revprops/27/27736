initial import of packaging files used by Arch Linux, provided by Loui Chang (louipc).  I took his files and modified them a little so that they are auto-populated with configure details, so there are fewer assumptions (cept there's no good way to populate the md5 checksum field without tying this to 'make dist' somehow; might just be best to remove them).
