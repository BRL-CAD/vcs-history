Consistently use integers instead of shorts for the region id, air code, GIFT material code, and los value for the rt_comb_internal structure.  region ids are already handled almost entirely as integers throughout the code, but the usage of shorts in the comb structure seems to be a carry-over from prior v4 format support that was never changed.  a review of code seems to indicate that the only negative impact should only be rather unsupported behavior if someone actually reverts a v5 db to v4 that has region idents that overflow short.  (this mod is in support of JTCG/ME and addresses sf bug 1532661 "Mismatch In Size of region_id" reported by Tom Browder)
