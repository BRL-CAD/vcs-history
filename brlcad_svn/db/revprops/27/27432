add a new rt_mirror() routine for mirroring an object about a specified axis.  the routine is derived from mged's f_mirror command hook and is one step closer towards getting rid of the switch on primitive types.  routine takes a database instance, a from and to object name, and the axis and returns a directory pointer to the new mirror object.
