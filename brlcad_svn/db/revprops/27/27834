be extra careful about clearing out variables when we're done with them and utilizing even less space when encoding string chars.. we're right up against the ARG_MAX limit on irix and (some) bsd systems where keeping two copies of our COPYING file in memory is turning out to be too much, but everything is fine if we only ever have just one copy of the file retained in memory.  ahh, such abusive fun with environment variables.
