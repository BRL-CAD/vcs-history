bu_vls_vprintf() shouldn't inch up the size of the string
with multiple mallocs per line, it should make sure that there
is at least a line's worth of buffer available before starting.
If somebody really wants to keep *lots* of small strings around
in vls buffers, they should dup 'em after building 'em up.
