Expurgation of Tcl/Tk code complete.
This interface now uses only Xlib and GL calls.
The following bug remains: when the image is first drawn, on occasion it
is not drawn completely.  When a redraw is forced, the rest of the image
appears.  This might be a problem with the flush routine (although
ogl_flush() seems pretty thorough) or with the handling of the first exposure
event.
