Use a sentinel file instead of listing all of the output directories - approach suggested by David Cole on the CMake list, seems to work and build doesn't keep recopying files.  Also tweak the tclscript routines to depend on the file used by the copy target.  Disable the option to turn targets on/off - now needed for tclscripts build, no longer spewing one target for file, and anyway the build should ensure changes made to data files in the src dir are reflected in the data tree in the build dir.
