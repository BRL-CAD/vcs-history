call NEAR_EQUAL() with a 0.001 tolerance instead of rt_fdiff() since that function is deprecated.  this potentially affects fastgen platemode overlap reporting since it's no longer performing a relative tolerance comparison, but the impact shouldn't be too significant since the absolute tolerance is rather loose at 0.001
