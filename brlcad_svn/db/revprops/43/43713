Looks like that doggone global was stuck in 'on', and because it started that way the plans never formed properly - they assumed no output command was needed when it was.  The global was inherited from the design of find, and I never cared for it, but it'll be a bit of work to do it any other way so for now just make sure it's zero before we start forming plans.
