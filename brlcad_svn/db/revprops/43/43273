implement an initial shp-g shapefile importer for BRL-CAD.  this was developed in less than a day during Civic Hack Day in order to visualize Baltimore City data made available to the public.  the converter takes the shapefile input (using shapelib) and imports the data as sketch/extrude geomettry.  sketches working great, extrudes need some debugging love.
