fixed the combination editor.  didn't achieve understanding into the underlying cause (left as an exercise to the reader), but changing Itcl_Init() to a 'package require Itcl' was not equivalent.  iwidgets ends up attempting to create a class twice (LabeledFrame) causing a runtime error.  changed back so release can progres.
