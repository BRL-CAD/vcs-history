clear a strict compilation warning from gcc 4.5.1 (reported by bhinesley via irc) where a warning about an operation within the random number generator may be undefined.  it's undoubtedly due to multiple increment calls being passed as function args, so evaluation order might not be what one would expect.  simple enough to get the random number prior to the function.
