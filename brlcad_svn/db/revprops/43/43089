Clean up the Aqua logic a little.  Punt on Aqua for now, since a) it's not working anyway b) there's a fair bit of work to do with the tcl/tk CMake logic to enable Aqua c) the Aqua layer for Tcl/Tk is in flux (moving from Carbon to Cocoa) and it's not clear that the older Carbon backend in 8.5 will work on newer OSX systems (all new development effort is focused on the Cocoa backend).  Togl will need to be made to work with the new Cocoa backend once it appears as well - preliminary patches have been merged but they are untested, so revisit then when Aqua backend becomes hot again.
