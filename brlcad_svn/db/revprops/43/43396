major quellage cleanup including missing struct elements, unused parameters, exact floating point comparisons, unused vars, and much more.  big honkin commit because of two changes that ripple through.  ap global changed to APP so that params passing an ap can use ap for the param name.  also replaced convention of using a version char* global with a version() function.
