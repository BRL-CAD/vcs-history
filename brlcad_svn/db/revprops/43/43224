Don't copy the headers into the bin dir - a little experience suggests that it's better from a debugging standpoint to have error messages relating to headers pointing directly back to the file to edit.  This is also a concern with Tcl/Tk data and the like, but there the tradeoff is between complicating search logic vs. identifying the file to modify in case of error - need to check but if memory serves Tcl/Tk errors aren't very helpful about pointing out what file to edit anyway, so the loss would be fairly minimal.  Another possible approch might be to symlink instead of copy, but the cross platform implications of that would need to be explored.
