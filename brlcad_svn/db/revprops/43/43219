Tweaks to get BRL-CAD compiling with the latest clang/clang++ - a few things that look legit, lot of adding of UNUSED and removal of self assignments - if there was a reason to avoid UNUSED in these cases will have to revert and try something else.  Somewhat mysteriously, bu_byte_offset didn't cause a compiler failure - that's probably incorrect and we still need to do some sort of #if defined(__clang__) specific logic there.
