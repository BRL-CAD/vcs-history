replace all of the NEAR_*() calls with an arbitrary FLT_MIN (which is basically one ulp step up from 0) to their corresponding ZERO() and EQUAL() calls.  FLT_MIN shouldn't be used anyways unless 1ulp is the goal (in which case there's a libbn function for it), SMALL_FASTF is our base computation tolerance.
