restored interactive prompting for mged's 'mater' command, which was functionality lost during the migration to libged.this feature was prompted after discussions with ezzieyguywuf via IRC and after having run into the problem myself several times while modeling.  tutorial documentation was inconsistent as it relied on the interactive prompting for instruction.
