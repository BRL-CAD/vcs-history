Add more of the machinery for distcheck file checking - modify macros, add specific macros for ignoring things not otherwise covered by macros or build logic.  Fail in distcheck if an ignored file is represented elsewhere in the build logic - may indicate a previously unused file is now in use and shouldn't be ignored any longer.
