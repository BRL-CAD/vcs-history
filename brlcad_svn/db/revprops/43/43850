cliff and I apparently (hopefully) squished the 'red' command bug where it wasn't working on windows.  the problem was two-fold.  the regex code wasn't breaking on newlines and (apparently) libbu's mapped_file fallback support had an off-by-one error where it wasn't terminating the mapped file with a zero byte.  that was causing regex to scan beyond the buffer extent.  that issue very likely affects other tools and interfaces that use our mapped file support on windows, but nothing specifically confirmed.
