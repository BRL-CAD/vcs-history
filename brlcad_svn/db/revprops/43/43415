We don't want any of the CFLAGS being added to the BRL-CAD build to make it to src/other - from what I'm seeing on the CMake list the correct way to do this seems to be adding the src/other subdirectory before any CFLAGS are set at the top level.  This also means that the src/other CMakeLists.txt files have to 'stand on their own' a bit more than before - i.e. they can't depend on the toplevel settings to give them what they need.  This is fine (indeed it's the right way to do it) but jove in particular isn't a proper stand-alone subconfigure yet and some of the others probably need tweaking.  Hopefully this will build - currently stops with ntohl not being defined, which is unrelated.
