Chop third party macro stuff down to just autoconf - need to sync with the newer one in BRL-CAD, but this has specific improvements to the autoconf routines that will need to be merged back into the main version (BRL-CAD trunk no longer does third party builds with autoconf, but apr and friends look to be very difficult conversion prospects for CMake.)
