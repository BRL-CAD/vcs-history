bio.h header was de-netted, bin.h added.  found a few other show-stoppers, though.  nmg is busted due to a host/net bug.  have to test tie optimization for release notes (as it's the major highlight).  search implements '.' so it needs a quick test.  and finally, verify red/ted work since tom is reporting a failure in .2 with red.
