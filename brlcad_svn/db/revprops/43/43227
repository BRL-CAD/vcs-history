Go with symlinks on platforms that support them for data - this means we get both the build layout and editing in the source tree.  Windows is too stupid to allow this so we fall back on a full copy - it'll be up to the windows dev not to change things in the build tree and forget to copy them back to the source tree.  In principle if they do remember to do the edit in the original src file, the build targets should copy it for them.
