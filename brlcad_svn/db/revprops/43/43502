add an initial corrollary header file similar to bio.h but for internet networking instead of input/output.  it's similarly a 'private' self-contained header (so no HAVE_* defines), but should help consolidate the header preprocessor logic into one place.  this header is effectively treated as a system header coming before inclusions of brl-cad public/private headers.
