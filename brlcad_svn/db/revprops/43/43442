need librt_private.h for private flip func, also change call from rt_reldiff() to a NEAR_EQUAL() due to deprecation.  benchmark validation required but the use here seems to be a fairly safe since we're considerably tightening the test whether the vectors reduces the ellipse equation down to quadratic form.  might affect worst case performance but should provide the same results.
