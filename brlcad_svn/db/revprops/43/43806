Nifty tweak for doc directory - although it's early to be thinking along the lines of docbook, set up an svn:externals property to pull the xsl sheets and any other resources from BRL-CAD's doc/docbook directory, instead of duplicating them in geomcore.  Also rename Doxyfile - that will need to have some hardcoded paths replaced with CMake variables.
