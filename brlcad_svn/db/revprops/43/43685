why there are custom blocks of code to unitize the vector instead of calling VUNITIZE() is curious and potentially related to the fuzzy instability.  regardless, tweak the dot product result if it just barely over/under-shoots due to precision problems.  using NEAR_ZERO/NEAR_EQUAL here isn't optimal since it'll clamp values already within the valid [1.0,-1.0] range to the limit of that range.
