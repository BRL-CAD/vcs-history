inadvertently reviewing and fixing bugs for release, fixed a never-implemented feature of halfspaces.  if you put them into a combination and apply a matrix to the combination, librt would bomb with an invalid magic error.  the half primitive was updated to handle that case which is used by mged to apply matrices to wireframes without writing to a disk record.
