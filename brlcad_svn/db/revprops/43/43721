implement some nifty redraw code that looks at what objects are displayed and what command-line arguments were specified.  if displayed objects are being listed on the command line, then they are potentially being edited so go ahead and redraw them.  while this might cause redraw lag for huge models on commands that are merely read-only, the more common problem is the display not being refreshed when it should for commands that DO edit the geometry, leading to user confusion and mistakes.  consider the latter the more prevalent failure and negative user experience of the two, so redraw.  this should more universally and consistently update the display list and allow some of the other wrappers to be eliminated.
