may or may not be specific to Mac OS X, but the bug report and confirmation were both on Mac OS X.  the bug prevented both archer and rtwizard (both bwish-based) from running.  they'd abort out during initialization with a multiple class error.  problem was isolated as a change to the way bwish initialized.  thanks to vtts for reporting the related combination editor bug via IRC.  Runtime release testing for the previous release presumably happened on Linux, so this may be a platform-specific issue.
