Rework how CFLAGS are assigned in CMake.  Major changes are using build type specific flags to hold things instead of the catch-all, and changing the STRICT_FLAGS brlcad_config.h include to WARNING_FLAGS.  The way CMake sets things up, turning on the warnings but not strict just means you're expecting to see all the same output without failing.  Conditionalizing the bu.h undef/redefine logic on strict and not warning violated that principle, because format warnings would appear without strict being set but disappeared once it was set.  Conditionalize instead on whether we have the warnings - it's possible to be strict without the extra warnings, and not strict with the warnings, so the warnings are a better variable to key off of.  Need to adjust configure.ac in trunk to define WARNING_FLAGS instead of STRICT_FLAGS, or change how it behaves as well - probably simpler to rename variable and just go with existing behavior until cmake logic goes live.
