MFC r43815, put STRICT_FLAGS back where it was - apparently the presence of %V warnings only in non-strict builds is expected - we want to see other bu_log related warnings that are valid, and cannot separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to the error reporting, so we have to make that tradeoff in order to add -Werror.  This is very unfortunate since it means a strict build isn't sufficent to catch all valid warnings and a NON-strict build is also required for full coverage.
