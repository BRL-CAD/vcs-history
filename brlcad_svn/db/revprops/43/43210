provide a ZERO() macro that corresponds with the EQUAL() macro.  tolerance is defined at compile-time so it's not the best to use, but still more reliable than exact floating point comparisons.  it'll also permit cleaning up numerous NEAR_ZERO() callers that arbitrarily use SMALL, SMALL_FASTF, and SQRT_SMALL_FASTF when the intent is just a nearness to zero.
