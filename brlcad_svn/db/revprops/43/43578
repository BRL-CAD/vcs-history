reword tie integration from user-visible perspective.  erik integrated the former 'libtie' high-performance triangle intersection engine (tie) into librt as a way to get optimized BoT raytracing.  initial results showing a halfing reduction of raytrace time for models at 2k+ triangles.  erik added an 'rt_bot_mintie' option (exposed via mged and rt -c) for toggling when the optimization kicks in.  currently set really high at 4M until further testing and improvements are made.
