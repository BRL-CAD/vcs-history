formally deprecate the old eXternal Data Representation (XDR) functions via API markers.  all of the bu_p(long|short|etc) and bu_g(long|short|etc) functions have comparable byteorder functions provided standard via posix.1 as hton(l|s) and ntoh(l|s).  the one exception is support for converting 64-bit long long types, so use the recently added configure.ac tests and define htonll() and ntohll() respectively as macros supporting big and little endian platforms.
