fix mged zoom bindings on mac os x with default X11 (where 3-button mouse emulation is disabled) so that you can actually zoom out.  make cmd-click behave the same as button-3.  unfortunately, the same binding does not seem possible with option-click for mouse 2 (in fact, option seems to act like mod2 aka the command-key.  none of the other mod types seem to help.
