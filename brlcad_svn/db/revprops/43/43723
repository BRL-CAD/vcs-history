restore incremental prompting functionality to the mater command.  even better than before.  leverage GED_MORE for additional prompting for any unspecified arguments.  also takes advantage of bu_str_true()'s ability to detect input exceptions.  this feature was prompted by discussions with ezzieyguywuf via IRC and having run into the problem myself several times, where mater unintentionally stopped prompting for missing arguments when it was migrated to libged. the documentation was also inconsistent since it referred to previous interactive prompting.
