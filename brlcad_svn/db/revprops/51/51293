Updated the mged gr/grouper command in file grouper.tcl. Fixed a bug where the display state was not reset when grouper exited. This was causing the frame buffer to not display correctly. Improved logic to ignore a selection box with zero area. Changed the output of the contents of the selection box to list on a single line. This change was to make easier copying and pasting of this list. Improved status messages while grouper is processing.  

END
