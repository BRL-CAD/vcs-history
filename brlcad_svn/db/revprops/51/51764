Changed the definition of the *ged_graph_objects_positions* routine; integrated it as a command. Made sure that the commands *graph_objects_positions*, and *graph_structure* always exist so that the user is not misinformed that they are invalid commands, provided that the Adaptagrams library isn't available.
