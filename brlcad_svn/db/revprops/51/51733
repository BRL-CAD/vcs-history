Updated function nmg_edge_g_fuse and added functions ex_comp ey_comp and ez_comp which are used by the updated nmg_edge_g_fuse function. These changes are in file "nmg_fuse.c". These changes were to improve the performance of the nmg_edge_g_fuse function. This change effects the mged facetize and ev commands along with most of the geometry export tools. The performance improvement is most noticed when the number of facets in the model is roughly over 50,000.
