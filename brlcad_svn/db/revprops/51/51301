this is easily the biggest release we've made since going open source.  add write-up details on some of the bigger changes occuring with this release including the completion of coverity fixes, nurbs enhancements and v&v, importer improvements, doc translations, introduction of the socis simulation project, ambient occlusion, integration of rtwizard, and more.  should have released before the coverity backlogging... and pressed for it harder/sooner after.  still, lots of great awesome.
