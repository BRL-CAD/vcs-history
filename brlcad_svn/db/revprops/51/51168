This fixes some of the issues that were encountered using the rtwizard interface in Archer. The fix was to compute the eye_pt (i.e. a call to get_eyemodel computes this) whenever the display changes and convert it to view coordinates before comparing to the mSavedViewEyePt. The eye_pt with the largest Z value wins. This value, if set, is used to override libged/rtwizard.c.
