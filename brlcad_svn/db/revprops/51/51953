Added routines for positioning the nodes and setting the layout of the graph. Along with the name, type, and positions of the objects, the coordinates of the connection points between the nodes are provided as well to the Tcl script. The outputted graph has now an organized structure, polyline connections and arrows at each end of an edge.
