daniel applied a fix in r47473 for a bug that was preventing the detection of V4 regions during raytrace.  it looks like this is the same bug reported by chris pitts a couple weeks ago, which he'd traced down to db5_sync_attr_to_comb() wiping out the comb structure.  recommit to fix name consistency.
