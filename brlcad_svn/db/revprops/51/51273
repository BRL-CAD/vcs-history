MGED dumps core when trying to pick an edit primitive from the display when nothing is displayed. The problem was in wdb_rt_gettrees_cmd(). We need to keep checking argc since it's being decremented as we process args. Also modified wdb_cmd() ===> needed to pass a pointer to ret in the call to bu_cmd so we get the correct return value.
