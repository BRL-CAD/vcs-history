Added a new mged command "bot_fuse". Add a new file "src/libged/bot_fuse.c" and updated files "include/ged.h", "include/raytrace.h", "src/libged/Makefile.am", "src/libged/CMakeLists.txt", "src/mged/setup.c", "src/libtclcad/tclcad_obj.c" and "src/librt/primitives/bot/bot_brep.cpp". This new command is a work in progress. This command attempts to repair BOTs using NMG fuse functions.
