Added a mechanism for using mouse interactions to edit the matrix above some member of a combination. Previously, mouse interactions resulted in edits getting pushed into the selected object. That is if the selected object was a combination, the edits wound up as matrices above all members in the combination. And if the selected object was a primitive, the edits were pushed into the primitive. Archer has another mode button in the toolbar for deciding how mouse interactions are applied to the select object.
