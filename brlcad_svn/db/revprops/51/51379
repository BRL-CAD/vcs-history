Don't just need loops, need to know which loop is the outer loop.  Could cheat since we're using xyz planes at the moment, but since this should be more general need to project edge points onto a common plane for bbox comparison.  Start preparing needed pieces.  For now, turn off NURBS components - not ready for them yet.
