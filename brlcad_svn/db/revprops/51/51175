revert r51012.  it's unclear how the comment is true, improving reliability on Windows, because the casts are not right. they describe an array of character pointers (char*[]), but then that's repeatedly used as a 'char *' with casts forced everywhere.  needing casts pervasively like that is a sign something is fundamentally wrong.  casts should be rare.
