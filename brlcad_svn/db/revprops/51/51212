Problem was not with the red regressions, but a deeper issue involving syncing low level data structures and attributes - red editing saw appropriate region flag, but some other tools wouldn't.  Fixed now - may possible be worth adding a different test to check specifically for this in the future, but it's only likely to come up in the next big attribute handling refactor.
