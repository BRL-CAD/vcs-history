This fixes an issue in _ged_rt_set_eye_model() where displayed geometry was not showing up in a raytrace due to the eye_model not getting adjusted at all or an adjustment was made incorrectly. The first problem was that the eye_model was not getting adjusted unless the view center was inside the bounding box of the displayed solids. This breaks depending on the view. If not zclipping the eye_model is now always getting adjusted. The second problem was that the eye_model was getting adjusted by the extent of the bounding box diagonal alone. We also need to consider how far away the center of displayed geometry is from the view center.
