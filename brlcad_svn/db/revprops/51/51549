Do some experimentation with altering LIB_DIR.  Need some introspective ability to know the relative library path, so add a command that can give us that.  DOC_DIR needs some work - should be more like MAN_DIR and not necessarily assume DATA_DIR is the final destination.  Looks like the main problem with moving things out of lib is (surprise) the Tcl/Tk initialization process and packages.
