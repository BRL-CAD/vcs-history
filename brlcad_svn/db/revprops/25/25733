clamped integer value printing of primitives in mged (addresses sf 'bug'/request 1359253).  this is a cosmetic change that identifies primitive values being displayed that are within hardware floating point tolerance of an integer and clamps the value to the integer instead of printing the floating point fuzz that got injected (most likely due to units or a double->float->double conversion).  this could be extended to all load/store operations to correct floating point conversion errors, but there's probably more to be gained by replacing floats with fastf_t's instead.
