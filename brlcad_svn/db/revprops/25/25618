refactor the resource searching into a look_for function so that it's clear exactly what directories are being searched for which resources.  remove the compiling and automatic conversion of encountered ascii files for now too.  resources are searched for presuming first that we're a binary install and failing that, we're being run from a source distribution after a make or make benchmark.  identify the major sections with comment labels, and rename the benchmark function to bench in order to not be confused with the tool of the same name.  this fixes a bug in the run-time identification of resources in the share/brlcad/VERSION directory.
