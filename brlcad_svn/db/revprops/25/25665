no longer install tclsh/wish, use btclsh/bwish.  this simplifies our scripting consistency and gives better knowledge over whose tools are being invoked, aside from also being able to customize the command processing, providing brl-cad tcl commands, and auto-loading our required packages.  this was done in 7.4.0
