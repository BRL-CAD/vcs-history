readd the searching of top_srcdir/include as it is required in order to support distcheck and building in non-srcdir builds.  since it causes trouble for the system facility/header checks (e.g. tcl.h -- which probably shouldn't be in 'our' main header dir anyways), set the cppflag after the system checks are done.
