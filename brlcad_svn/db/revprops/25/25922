add a check to test whether we ended up with POSIX threading if only primarily to have the hint in the config.log output.  the pthread test was found in gd's configure.ac and seems a reasonable fairely comprehensive test.  pthread_cleanup_push is reportedly non-functional stub function on solaris; pthread_create and pthread_join are not necessarily in the same lib on irix (even though we prefer sproc on irix for performance); pthread_attr_init is apparently bonked on dec too.
