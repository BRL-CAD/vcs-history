add support for --enable-everything and --disable everything options to simplify configuration when making distributions.  this requires consolidating all the 'checking' print messages for whether args were select together after checking for the everything setting.  also, add the args to BC_RETRY_CONFIGURE so that they are preserved on reinvocation.
