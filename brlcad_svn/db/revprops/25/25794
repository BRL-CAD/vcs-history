Updated termination check so that "vol/weight" tests cannot cause early
termination when "error checks" are being done.  The -n required_hits flag
now only applies to vol/weight calculations.  This fixes a behavioral bug
where analysis could run past the "lower" limit on the grid spacing.
Since interface checking is not implemented, it was removed it from the manpage.
Updated manpage with new syntax for -g option.  This is not implemented, but it
snuck in.  I'll commit the changes to g_qa.c RSN.
