don't buy into the philosophy of requiring a minimum version so strictly.  add extra failure support for configure.ac files that are actually using autoconf macros newer than the stated minimum requirement on the half-presumption that they are perhaps not strictly necessary for the build.  warn verbosely about any edits iff it helps autoconf succeed.  this helps everything 'just work' even for the maintainers without requiring tools to be updated for potentially insignificant _yet_still_ useful macros. the gnu autotools folks really suck for making forward/backwards cross-platform version support such a pain (both bugs and by trying to force devs onto a single version across all supported platforms).  issues like this make scons more appealing every day, impractical idiots.
