commit a version that walks the specified geometry both with db_walk_tree() and db_functree().  db_functree was ultimately considerably more simple for this exercise, but useful to see what was provided with db_walk_tree and the differences. add support to run the client either passing all geometry or just a subset (hence the subtree walking)
