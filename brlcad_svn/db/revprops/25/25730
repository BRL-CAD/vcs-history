include math.h and float.h since they are required by this header; remove the archaic sqrt() prototyping (should be detected/provided by configure); add comments on NEAR_ZERO and CLAMP; implement INTCLAMP for determining whether a value is within computation tolerance of an integer -- if it is, return the value clamped to the integer.

END
