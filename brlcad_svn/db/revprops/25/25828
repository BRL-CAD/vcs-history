ran across george toth's name on src/librt/memalloc.c which cvs shows dating back to at least 1988.  that makes him almost certainly a BRL contributor, though uncertain where he falls in the timeline in relation to the others and whether or not he was a core developer (indications point towards isolated contributions)
