New kd-tree building algorithm (yet to be named) is now suitable for general purpose
use as an improvement (avg 25% - 100% faster) over the old algorithm and uses about
half the memory consumption as before.  One more criteria is yet to be added, more
improvements to come.  Algorithm is 10x slower than mid-split so kd-tree caching
is on the way.
