comment on the 'libtool: install: warning: ... .la ... has not been installed in' warnings being spewed by libtool due to some libtool bug that fails to install the .la files.  this bug is not bsd specific, but considerably more frequently observed on bsd since ports has had a never version of libtool for some time now.  seems to be a bug in the newest versions and may be related to not using LT_INIT or using the slightly older libtool.m4 with the newest.  regardless, provide a work around for libtool's lameness.
