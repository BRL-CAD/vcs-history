the perf.sh script is completely absorbed into run.sh as the function perf() allowing utilization of run.sh's existing search techniques for locating resources.  This fixes a problem/bug where perf.sh was incorrectly searching the right directory for reference logs.  by bringing the functionality internal, run.sh now gets to control righting to summary and there is no need to blindly tail the summary file for results.
