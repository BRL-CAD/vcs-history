Daniel Eischen on the FreeBSD project suggested using SIGINFO instead of calling the the private _thread_dump_info() function.  _thread_dump_info is/was provided by the bsd c_r library which is not used in certain 5.* versions of bsd (e.g. 5.4 on amd64) when using the -pthread option.  since _thread_dump_info is called when a SIGINFO is raised, it should be equivalent.  probably drops support for older bsd systems that predate sysinfo, but they'll probably require more work regardless
