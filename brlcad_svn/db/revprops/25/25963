do not include our config.h header in common.h if common has been installed (our public header files shouldn't be using config defines anyways).  this will undoubtedly require more testing, but it makes it such that 3rd party developers don't necessarily need to include /usr/brlcad/include or use -DHAVE_CONFIG_H to get the header to simply work
