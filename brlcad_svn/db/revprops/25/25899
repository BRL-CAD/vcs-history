the variance computations in the benchmark suite weren't correctly
checking for a negative average error causing a negative variance
causing a computation of a sqrt against that negative causing the
suite to catch and output the error as:

ERROR: square root of negative numbers is only in your imagination
awk: division by zero
 input record number 1, file
 source line number 1
/usr/brlcad/bin/benchmark: line 704: test: -le: unary operator expected

problem solved by taking the absolute value of the negative error when
computing the variance.
