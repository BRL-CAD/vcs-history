adam ross was really a full developer, even through GSI, given the quantity and level of his changes and contributions so credit him appropriately.  time-wise, that slots him around chris johnson and mike markowski.  markowski confirmed that he started during BRL and that he doesn't mind his e-mail being added. jra is still active.
