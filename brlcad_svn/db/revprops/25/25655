bogus autom4te.cache protection.  handle corrupted/invalid cache dirs that will cause aclocal to fail.  handle out-of-date cache dirs that autoconf 'should' recognize but obviously doesn't for at least most current versions of autoconf as well resulting in an unnecessary failure.  cache files shouldn't halt tools, stupid lame gnu build system tools.
