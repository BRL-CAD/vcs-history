simplify the summary printing at the end, where a separation line comprised of asterisks is output with a length based on the dynamic length of the 'brl-cad is installed here' line.  the motivation for the change is due to the peculiar difference in the behavior of bsd make vs gnu make.  performing a mathematical expr that evaluates to zero (e.g. expr 3 - 3) causes expr to return a non-zero return value causing bsdmake to think something failed, even though we are in the middle of a special shell rule.  this 'failure' in turn halts a make install, although we are 'done' by this point anyways.  still, the error is annoying and using tr to generate the asterisks line is hopefully sufficiently portable, and it avoids the expr/bsdmakism regardless. may the bsd builds rejoice in unity.
