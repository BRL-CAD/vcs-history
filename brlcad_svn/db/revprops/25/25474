get rid of the -fPIC hack, libtool really should take care of it (figure out the altix problem later if it's still around); get rid of -mdynamic-no-pic as it wasn't supposed to actually get added to a flag, it only encouraged the test to fail on non darwin systems before the tests were refactored to BC_ tests.
