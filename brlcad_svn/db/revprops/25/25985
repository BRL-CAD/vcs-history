This is an application for re-shooting rays and comparing the results
to previous applicatin runs.  The princiiple use will probably be
in the regression test suite.  In that context, it should allow us
to shoot all the MUVES test suite rays outside of MUVES.  The one downside
is that it relies on the RT_G_DEBUG flag DEBUG_ALLHITS to cause librt
to log the original rays.  Since floating point values are logged with %g some
precision is lost.
