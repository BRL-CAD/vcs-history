rewrite do_pixel() for a 30% performance enhancement on an model-less scene. this results in a savings of 5-30% time depending on model complexity/size.  the performance is gained by removing some rediculous memory copying into temporaries and optimizing away several divisions and modulos.  the main loop is also unrolled one iteration since the default case does not involve hypersampling. also rework the logic on testing whether a pixmap (previous results render) is being used since considerable time was spent testing each pixel even when a pixmap wasn't being used.  most of these optimizations were performed based on Shark profiler results on OS X of rendering a large empty image. there are still a plethora of cpu stalls that should be fixable with compiler alignment directives
