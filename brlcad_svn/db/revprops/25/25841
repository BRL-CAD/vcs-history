increment in steps of 100 instead of the previous 500 -- not likely to have 100 objects being cloned together; replace the dist function with the vmath.h DIST_PT_PT macro; add comments out the wazoo for what's going on; provide the correct minor_type for db_diradd(); add some sanity checks and debug printing; convert all the string manipulations to be strncmp, strncpy, etc (though they should be just bu_vls strings)
