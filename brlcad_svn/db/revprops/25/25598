if the intersection normal that's returned is knowingly reversed, flip it (while still complaining).  this usually indicates a bug in the underlying primitive or a problem with the geometry itself, but rendering nothing/black is pretty worthless.  also, limit the number of shade_input messages about flipped normals to just 100 so as not to spew unnecessarily to the console and slowing down the raytrace.
