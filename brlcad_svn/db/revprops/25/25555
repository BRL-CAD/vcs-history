itcl doesn't need to include the include directory, in fact it causes problems since it can pick up our itcl.h which picks up our tcl.h which requires common.h which requires HAVE_CONFIG_H to be defined which causes problems. (thanks Stefan Fiedler)  in face, don't add include to our overall cppflags either since autoheader is supposed to take care of this in the makefiles
