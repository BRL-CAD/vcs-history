type_arb() was calling redoarb(), which was rearranging vertices.
Is this correct?  I'm not sure, but I've commented out the call
for now.  In any event, it's certainly a nasty little side-effect
that you'd be excused for not expecting given the name of the
function (i.e. type_arb()) and the context in which it's called!
