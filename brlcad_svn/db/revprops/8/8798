"unglued edge"
problem is happening in nmg_fcut.c, on NMG_ACTION_CUTJOIN, when
connecting a lone vertex with an existing loop.  The routine
nmg_join_singvu_loop() joins the lone vertex to the existing loop with a
new edge, without bothering to search to see if there is an existing
edge. Nor should it.  I've modified that block of code to call
nmg_findeu() first;  if an existing edge is found, after the new one is
made, the two are fused together in proper radial orientation.
