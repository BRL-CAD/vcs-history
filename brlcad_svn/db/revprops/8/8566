(1) Intersection of vertex with line changed to enlist vertexuses,
and to make a comprehensive search.
(2) All edgeuses on a line of intersection (from the other face)
are tabulated, in an attempt to do a better job linking them
up with intersections made in the other face.
All this code is highly suspect.
