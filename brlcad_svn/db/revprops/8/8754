When breaking
an edge in fu1 at the intersection point ("hit_pt") with the fu1/fu2
intersection line, and there is no existing vertex for that point, and
there are edges in fu2 that line on the intersection line (and in this
case happen to cross the hit_pt), just dropping an OT_BOOLPLACE
self-loop into fu2 isn't the best thing to do, because there is the risk
that intersections might not be done later.  I've written
nmg_break_eg_on_v() to take care of the business right away.
That fixed m13 and m15.
