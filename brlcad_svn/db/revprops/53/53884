Now that DocBook documentation does pass xmllint validation thanks to Cezar's work, turn on validation whenever BRL-CAD's strict build setting is enabled (i.e. most of the time.)  xmllint validation is the DocBook analogue to our C/C++ strict flags, so it makes sense to enable both when we're being 'strict' - forces us to keep the sources in a clean state.
