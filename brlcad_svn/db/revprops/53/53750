Fixed a bug in function "nmg_bool" in file "nmg_bool.c". Changed when classlist is allocated to after all changes to the model are complete. The reason is these changes increase the number of objects in the model and the allocated size of classlist needs to be large enough for all the objects. Also changed when function "nmg_classify_shared_edges_verts" is called to after all changes to the model are complete.

END
