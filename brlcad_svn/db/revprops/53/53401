big whoosh repair of the assumption that fastf_t are doubles.  critically, all import/export routines CANNOT be fastf_t since that's intended to be a variadic type (that's why there's a typedef).  we have to convert fastf_t to double before export and after import.  use the ELEMENTS_PER_* defines to convey the type where appropiate and helpful for documenting intent.
