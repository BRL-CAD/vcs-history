remove a hard-coded 0.001 constant that has been in here since 1989 (mike, r3900).  the intent seems to be to discard partitions that are behind the ray start point implying the constant was attempting to capture near-zero or negative partitions.  this should be something below SMALL_FASTF but the 'large' value implies it may be accommodating compound math model-space values so go with the more dynamic distance tolerance (0.0005) which makes this only slightly tighter than it was.  regression tested/passed on osx.
