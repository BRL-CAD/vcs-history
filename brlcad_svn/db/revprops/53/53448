revert r52479 that converted if_ogl to libbu memory management.  this caused a semaphore deadlock for rt where it had already acquired a BU_SEM_SYSCALL semaphore prior to the fb_open() call.  this is the second time a conversion to libbu caused a race -- need to adjust the locking api to avoid this recurring problem (and need to rework libfb to allow internal locks).
