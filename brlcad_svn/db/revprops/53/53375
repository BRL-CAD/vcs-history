Added a call to function "nmg_edge_fuse" at the end of function "rt_pipe_tess" in file "pipe.c". This is required because if a pipe is facetized to an NMG object, the resulting NMG can not be properly raytraced without the edges being fused. This also impacts NMG boolean operations since raytracing is sometimes necessary to determine if an NMG object is in/out/on another NMG object.
