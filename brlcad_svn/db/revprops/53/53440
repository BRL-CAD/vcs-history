Made changes to files "raytrace.h", "nmg_rt_segs.c" and "nmg_rt_isect.c" for functions "unresolved", "check_hitstate", "nmg_rt_print_hitlist", "hit_ins", "isect_ray_vertexuse" and "nmg_isect_ray_model". Did some code cleanup to help avoid confusion between the head of a "hitmiss" bu_list and elements in the bu_list. Fixed a bug in function "check_hitstate" causing NMG raytracing to fail.
