Facilitate merge work by removing the const_ typedef return types introducded in r49683. It's not clear that returned values need const qualification, or that they are assigned to lvalues that preserve that qualification, so these const_ types are presently an elaborate way to accomplish nothing, and moreover have caused issues parsing some express inputs. Until someone can authoritatively determine what values should and should-not be considered read-only, we'll take a much simpler approach to suppressing misued qualifier warnings by just omitting the erroneous application of const to generated return types.
