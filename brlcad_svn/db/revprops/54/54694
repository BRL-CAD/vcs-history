helped a navy user (roles) with a fastgen patch file conversion that uncovered a variety of issues that have been improved upon in patch-g.  the tool would cryptically fail if the file wasn't (unnecessarily) read/write.  it also had numerous hard-coded limits (like 500 materials, 1500 of this, 1000 of that) that would cause memory corruption and cascading bad behavior.  limits increased nearly two orders of magnitude, but still hard-coded for now since that requires a lot more data and testing to implement safely.
