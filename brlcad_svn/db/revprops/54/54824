Add a stripped down version of the jove.emacs Emacs configuration file intended to help Emacs emulate the jove editing experience ('stripped down' means removed things in the original file that didn't load in modern Emacs and/or code that didn't seem especially relevant to jove emulation.) Add to misc, in preparation for removal of src/other/jove.  This needs to be tested by experienced jove users, but it is a starting point.
