upon closer inspection, it looks like boost just did exactly what I had originally planned to do anyways, namely calling the pthread and win32 TLS api, so strip out the boost hooks.  it's not worth having the additional compilation complexity to get boost_thread compiling cleanly and the major third-party dep it would be adding to libbu.  we can just do our own thing here in far far fewer lines of code, far less integration complexity.
