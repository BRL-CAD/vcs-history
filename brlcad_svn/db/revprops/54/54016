confirmed after a bit of research that NRTC was indeed the northrOp research and technology center of the northrop corportation, prior to being merged into northrop grumman (1994), not northrup.  tracing back through ancient usenet and arpanet postings also confirms that Willson (two ell's) is indeed correct too.
