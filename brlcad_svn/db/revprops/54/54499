Initial checkin of the 'poly2tri'  C++ library for creating a constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) of a polygon using a sweep-line algorithm. This package will be used during the generation of facet meshes for BRL-CAD NURBS. This version of 'poly2tri'  was obtained from github at 'git://github.com/jhasse/poly2tri.git' and based of a google code project of the same name. The methodology implemented is based on the paper "Sweep-line algorithm for constrained Delaunay triangulation" by V. Domiter and and B. Zalik. This checkin is a snapshot of the initial repository code before being integrated into the BRL-CAD build system.
