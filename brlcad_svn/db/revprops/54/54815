TkTreeCtrl (http://tktreectrl.sourceforge.net) is a better, more powerful tree widget than the default ttk widget - there's a decent chance Archer will be making use of this, so checkpointing the CMake build for it.  Will revert until there is a need, but don't want to lose the working CMake build.  As a first step, commit the vanilla sources for a diffing baseline.
