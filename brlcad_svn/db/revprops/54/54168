In some cases (e.g. OS X), CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT is set to "" when threads are available, causing IF(CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT) to fail even if threads are available. This, in turn, causes compilation of libxml/src/threads.c to fail. We now check if Threads_FOUND is true, which should be more portable
