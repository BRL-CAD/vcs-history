users are trying to run dbupgrade on windows and were running into a -permissions error from tcl.  turns out that's not a valid 'file attributes' option on windows.  instead use the -readonly option.  also quote the file names all over the place and don't use a \R4 suffix just in case there are spaces or other special characters in the original file name or we're on windows.
