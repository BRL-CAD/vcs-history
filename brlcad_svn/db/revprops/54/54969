stub in an implementation of thread affinity for mac os x, to the extent that mac supports the notion.  they don't really do affinity, but will let you group/ungroup threads to help/discourage cache sharing.  here we put every thread into their own group so the default affinity scheduling should help minimize cpu movement.
