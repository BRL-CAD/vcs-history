Binary incompatible v4 file upgrade by dbupgrade resulted in shader contents that caused parse_list_elem to fail in bu_shader_to_key_eq - add sanity checks to make sure we've got something valid before proceeding.  Doesn't address why the shader string was garbled, but does prevent MGED from crashing when trying to draw the geometry.
