reported by user josh baker, fix a problem with the dbupgrade mged tcl command.  it was never tested on windows so there were several problems, most notably a 'file attributes' -permissions error that prevented the upgrade from starting.  there was also no accommodation for spaces in file names and it was using a windows-problematic \R4 file name suffix.
