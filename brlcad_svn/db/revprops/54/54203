Updated openNURBS file "openNURBS.dist" and removed files "opennurbs_brep_changesrf.cpp", "opennurbs_brep_kinky.cpp", "opennurbs_crashtest.h", "opennurbs_memory_new.cpp", "opennurbs.sln", "opennurbs.vcproj" and "opennurbs_staticlib.vcproj". These changes remove files not used by BRL-CAD and are not part of the 2012-10-24 version of openNURBS. In addition this corrects an error "Files listed in subversion but not accounted for in build logic", related to openNURBS, when running "make distcheck-full".
