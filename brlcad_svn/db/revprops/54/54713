Created libbu wrapper functions for functions "fseek", "lseek", "ftell", "fstat" and "stat". Made the name changes in most of the code. I did not change the names of the functions in c++ code and code which was not already using the libbu library. The purpose of these wrapper functions is that these functions are very platform specific especially for windows 64bit. These changes build on linux. More changes and testing is needed.
