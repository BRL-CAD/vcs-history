need to explore the portability of this, but go ahead and locally override the _GNU_SOURCE setting so that we can enable processor affinity for pthread systems.  after much headache, figured out that _GNU_SOURCE needs to be defined before the common.h header.  common includes some system headers and the features.h header is only going to get read once to set the necessary __USE_GNU define and declaring the CPU_* macros and pthread affinity funcs the implementation uses.  this is going to jack up linux benchmarks, but it's a nice 5-50% improvement on even small smp systems.
