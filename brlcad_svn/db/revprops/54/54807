implement macros for swapping vectors and matrices.  use a single temporary float for the vectors, but a full temp matrix for the matrix swap.  while the single fastf_t temp is fewer read/write instructions, it may be more coherent (faster) to use a full vector.  warrants testing if put into critical code. implemented in do{}while(0) fashion so a semicolon becomes necessary
