restore stdout and stderr when we're done with the GUI by capturing them with a dup() call and then later restoring back with dup2().  this fixes a problem where an atexit() callback couldn't write out anything during shutdown (SIGPIPE) because Tcl had destroyed the channel we set up.  document and descope a couple of the globals while we're at it.  untested, but this should work fine on windows as well because dup/dup2 are c89 and msdn-supported.  begging for some _WIN32 cleanup consolidation (the duplication seems unnecessary).
