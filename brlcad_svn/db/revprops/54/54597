re-re-revert to r54338 before I started causing damage.  apparently two different versions of opennurbs came out one month after the other, both labeled as v5.0 and the latter removing substantial functionality (3 functions) that we utilize.  there are some files to get a closer sync with the latest sources, but we'll need to either keep a *much* bigger patch set or implement even more functionality in our libraries going forward.
