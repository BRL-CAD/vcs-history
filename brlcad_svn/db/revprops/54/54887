apply skriptkid's (akshay kashyap's) gci patch (http://www.google-melange.com/gci/task/view/google/gci2012/8070202) that implements cpu thread affinity.  initial testing showed a HUGE impact on massively parallel systems with one 64-core ibm power7 system showing a benchmark performance improvement around 50% (VGR increase from 120k to 180k).  currently only implemented for pthread systems, but should be easily extended to other platforms and gives bu_parallel() some initial infrastructure so bu_parallel threads can know their CPU id.  very cool.
