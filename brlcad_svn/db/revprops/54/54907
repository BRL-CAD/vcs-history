clean up some of the failure logging and pass the thread cpu id numbers indexed from 1 to ncpu (inclusive).  that way we can reserve cpu 0 for the parent process/thread that is creating all of the threads.  stub in an initial bu_parallel_id() function to get the cpu id, but just checkpointing the work in progress because __thread is apparently unavailable on Mac OS X.
