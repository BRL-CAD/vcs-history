turns out r54203 was removing files that opennurbs removed, so I was wrong about them needing to be added to the build logic (something fishy, they were in my earlier version of 2012-10-24...).  there were other unsyncd files to be added and removed, though, and this gets them in sync.  notably updates their msvc and xcode build files (which we do not use), removes example_dump and their massprop code.  intentionally keeps the now-deleted opennurbs_x (surface surface intersection!), openurbs_brep_kinky (surface cleanup), opennurbs_brep_changesrf (surface conversion), and opennurbs_based (succinctly identifies RhinoSDK removals!).
