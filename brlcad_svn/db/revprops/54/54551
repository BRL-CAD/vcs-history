expand docs on how BU_GET()+BU_PUT() are supposed to be used, add new BU_ALLOC() convenience macro that basically is the same as the old BU_GETSTRUCT() macro without being specific to structs -- it just saves some of the typing repetition when allocating a single struct.  most of the existing BU_GET() calls will get converted to BU_ALLOC() unless a BU_PUT() pairing is obvious/trivial or if it's performance-critical code.
