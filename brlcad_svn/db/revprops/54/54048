ran into an rt crash when I enabled randmt on a highly-parallel system.  the global_state static was uninitialized leading to the conclusion that we either have a memory corruption issue or, more likely, a problem with initialization order.  c++ guarantees the order will be in the order declared, but I can't find any reference of that guarantee for C.  Still, the intermediate variable seems unnecessary since we can just get rid of the pointer.
