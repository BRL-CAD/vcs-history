Added _ged_combadd2 for the purpose of building up a comb tree from possibly more than one member before writing things out to the database. This was added for use by ged_group to reduce database fragmentation when adding many members (i.e. perhaps 100,000 or more). Note - _ged_combadd2 could use an upgrade to handle an array of relation operators so that functions like ged_comb could also benefit.
