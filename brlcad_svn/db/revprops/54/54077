eliminate enigma from our distribution. *sniff*  it's a maintenance cost that recently reared its head once again, which isn't acceptable for an interface we're not using.  it's even more obsoleted as time goes by as a public domain replacement for 'crypt' considering some desktop systems can bruteforce crack them in mere seconds.  if we need to encrypt something, we can look to modern methods.  doesn't go through our deprecation process because it's back-end infrastructure, not a tool we've provided (hence why it's always been in misc)
