bump RT_DBNHASH up to the next power of two instead of 5120 and document the heck out of it as a deprecated interface.  include memory usage calculations (64kb).  the increase from 1024 should slow down all of the callers that manually iterate over the hash (prep, search, db open/lookup, push, tops, ls, ...) but probably not noticeably so -- more likely to slow lookups down iterating down bigger linked lists with big geometry (need to profile/test/compare).
