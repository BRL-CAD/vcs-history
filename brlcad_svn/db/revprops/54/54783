mass conversion of nearly all the 2277 instances of bu_malloc() and bu_calloc() where there were single structure allocations to BU_ALLOC().  this has the main benefit of brevity, helping with maintainability and readability.  it reduced 20k chars and eliminated over 1.5 lines (same # statements, they just tended to span multiple lines because they were so wordy).  about 500 instances are converted.  the one logical change is that BU_ALLOC() ensures zero-initialization via bu_calloc() and that should generally be a good thing for structures, maybe even fix an obscure bug or two.
