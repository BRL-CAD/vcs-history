stub in an initial implementation of a really fast heap-based memory allocation capability for small allocation sizes.  it allocates size-designated blocks of memory ('pages') in order to substantially reduce calls to system malloc.  it has a nice property of being O(1) on alloc and profiles substantially faster than system malloc.  from half to several orders of magnitude in testing (making the call cost near-zero).  presently only implemented for byte sizes 1 through 64 (trivial to extend).  implementation of free is stubbed empty, but intend to reuse free cells and reclaim memory on-demand.  made to match BU_GET/BU_PUT so it can serve as the back-end implementation.
