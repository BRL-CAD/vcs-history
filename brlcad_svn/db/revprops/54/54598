redo the merging of additional updates, adding in some overlooked changes from the previous v5.0 update, without all the mess.  adds back the deleted opennurbs_brep_kinky.cpp and opennurbs_brep_changesrf.cpp for reference since they seem highly relevant to our needs (along with code in opennurbs_brep so they'll compile).  remerges r54573 (partial), r54576 (partial), r54577, r54580, and r54589.
