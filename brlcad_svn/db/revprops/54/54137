Fix several instances of VMINMAX being used without first initializing its min/max arguments. Also, consistently use INFINITY/-INFINITY rather than MAX_FASTF/-MAX_FASTF when initializing. That way if INFINITY/-INFINITY appears in any of the tested points it ends up in min/max rather than being replaced by MAX_FASTF/-MAX_FASTF. That faithful propagation could encourage bug discovery since INFINITY/-INFINITY are likely the result of an unintended divide by 0 or overflow condition.
