Adding vdslib 0.9 to src/other.  To preserve history, start with the original vdslib_0.9.orig.tar.gz contents from the Debian source package (the original website no longer has the source code - contacted the author to see if 1.0 was available, but apparently it hasn't survivied - in any case 0.9 is the version with a license that works for us.)
