fixed an infinite loop.  turns out if you subtract your only light source from the scene, the tracer thinks it's there but can't shoot visibility rays at it.  there was a retry loop based on the assumption that we might need to retry since the light radius/angle is random number generated.  that seems to be an unnecessary bias, though, and is clearly unhelpful when there is no light to be hit.
