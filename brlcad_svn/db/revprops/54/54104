rename and move doc/deprecation.txt to a new top-level CHANGES file.  that name was selected after reviewing a number of other projects with similar deprecation announcement requirements and it seems to be a reasonable evolution.  more clearly announcing changes to developer users is just as important (if not more so) as the non-developer 'user-visible' NEWS items.  It has also been a repeat topic of discussion, a repeat issue (devs not remembering it's in doc/), and one of the most frequently revisited docs.  That's compelling support for introducing a new top-level file.  Introducing it into include/ was considered, but it also covers commands.
