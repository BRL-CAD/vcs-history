restore the increased M_SQRT3 precision change that carl had made to the polynomial root solver, which broke the solids regression test.  walking the math through the debugger showed that a slightly different root was being returned causing a ray to intersect the massively distorted eto in the solids regression at enough of a delta to cause different light computations.  this resulted in a single pixel off-by-many, which we also update in the reference image so that it reflects the new more accurate answer.  while we're at it, increase the precision of 1/3 and 1/27th by computing them during static init.
