revert 54485 since the added precision introduces lots of benchmark result off-by-many changes.  the low precision .707 value has been there since Version 2 of RT (commit 395 in Aug 1985).  a case for updating the benchmarks could be made, but the sensitivity possibly introduced by the double-precision value is concerning (will single-precision fastf_t give same values?)
