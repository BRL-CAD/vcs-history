The following tweaks are for Archer's sketch editor. Update the sketch panel when the units are changed. Use bboxVerts to get the bounding box instead of calling the canvas' bbox method. This results in a better initial scale factor for the sketch view.  Hook the edit panel entries to non-array variables. Other minor tweaks.
