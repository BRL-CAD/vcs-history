OK, make a better stab at this - a single commit that makes both tktreectrl and tkdnd packages available in BRL-CAD.  Not clear yet if tkdnd is the right thing to use for tree element manipulation, but it will allow for support for things like dragging and dropping a .g file onto Archer to open it.
