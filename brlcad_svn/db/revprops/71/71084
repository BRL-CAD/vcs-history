maybe bad idea, but try turning on address sanitizing by default for unoptimized builds.  they're already 2x slower, so this may make them 3x-4x slower than optimized builds, but we get a whole host of valgrind-style error detection at runtime (oob accesses, use-after-free/return/scope, double/invalid free, and leaks).  rename other one verb-noun s/BRLCAD_THREAD_SANITIZER/BRLCAD_SANITIZE_THREAD/g.
