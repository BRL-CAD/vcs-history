Add support to db_lookup for getting the leaf dp for a full path.  Based on 
GSoC work by Peter Pronai.  This is intended to allow search -exec to operate
on object returned by full path names.  It also has the side effect of making 
ls return the leaf object of a path if it exists - e.g. ls all.g/platform.r
will now return platform.r, instead of object not found.  This doesn't break
make check, and is arguably an improvement over returning an error since the
path input could never have been an object name to begin with.  However, it is
not ideal in that a path-to-file ls on the Linux command line will return the
full path not just the root file name.  I think this is OK to go with for now,
since we can always handle ls behavior at the ls command level if we so desire,
but before announcing the change in NEWS it warrants discussion/a second
opinion.
