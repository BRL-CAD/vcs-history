Use a slightly different example, which with the M35 will return 3 results for easier verification of expected search behavior (the -v flag is useful here, probably should mention that...).  Note that if we append the / to all.g a who report on the drawn objects still reports only the primitives, despite the draw command supporting full paths if given them...
