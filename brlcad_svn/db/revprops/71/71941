Replace the Clarkson convex hull code with Antti Kuukka's C++11 implementation of quickhull from https://github.com/akuukka/quickhull - a timing comparison with the Stanford lucy model reported 2.5 seconds with the new method vs. 11 minutes 45.5 seconds with the old method.  (Part of the time increase for the old method was due to the overhead of swap space usage - memory requirements also appear to be *much* lower for the new code.)
