Preliminary script that runs all commands and evaluates whether they
display usage, return an error, indicate deprecation, and more.
Implemented for commands that get cleaned up (e.g., with usage fitting
within 80 columns), to help them stay clean and concise.

Currently uses the GNU timeout utility, so portability is limited.  It
also takes several minutes to get through hundreds of commands, so
it's not yet enabled as a test until it can run in parallel.
