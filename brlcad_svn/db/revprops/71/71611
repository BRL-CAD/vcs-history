eliminate the long-standing bu_brlcad_data() stalwart.  bu_brlcad_root() is essentially a drop-in replacement for typical use (adding 'share/' to the beginning of any paths being looked for, though intent is to replace both with new API.  this eliminates an old autotools carryover where bu_brlcad_data() would search up a hierarchy for resources -- which shouldn't be needed any more with a build root mostly matching an installation root.
