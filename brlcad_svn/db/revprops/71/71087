simplify, we only need to take the address to get around the function pointer 'conversion'.  this could be wrong on a platform where function pointers are not the same as void pointers, but posix guarantees that it'll work for any platform providing dlsym.  now since we technically wrap other implementations, e.g., windows, calling code should probably still only do data object symbol lookups (which can contain function pointers).  also fix the other calls to use our bu api.
