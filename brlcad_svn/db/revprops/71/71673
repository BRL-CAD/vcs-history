fix a bug handling strings greater than 2GB chars long.  it was overflowing int and causing padding up to the amount of overflow.  conceivably still has this (or some other) issue for strings longer than max ssize_t (and > max size_t), but an improvement nonetheless.  detected via large .g file testing.
