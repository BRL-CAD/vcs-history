finally get to the meat of matters for specifying a cache dir.  here's new path API intended to replace bu_brlcad_* and other functions.  it uses vararg so callers can build up a path specficiation and be composable.  intentionally doesn't use vls for result to keep it application agnostic, but a bu_dir_vls() wrap may make sense depending on the call sites.  intentionally does not preserve the noisy lookup flag as that gets into front-end reporting.  enumerations are based on what we currently use, intentionally trying to avoid introducing notions of system and user versions of paths.
