fix source of rtwizard failures.  it was putting 0.0-to-255.0 values into a bu_color, which only happened to work when bu_color didn't care what values were stored (making some bu_color like these incompatible with others, depending on the values).  the intent here was 0-to-255 chars, so fix is simple.
