More work on hooking the polygonizer up to the winding number code.  This is undoubtedly getting the cart before the horse, since it's extremely likely most of the parts of the winding number computation stack are working, but in princple once it is clear how to hook this up the question then reduces to which components aren't doing what they are supposed to do correctly.
