clean libanalyze/api.c: remove some globals, move all common structures to analyze_private.h, replace raytracing_context with current_state structure; Add some more analysis features like ANALYSIS_OVERLAPS and ANALYSIS_EXP_AIR; update libanalyze/surf_area.c, libanalyze/volume.c and libanalyze/centroid.c to work with the structure change
