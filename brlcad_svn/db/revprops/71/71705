We no longer need to keep the reference images in .asc format for portability, and they just induced cost when lights.asc and moss.asc triggered name collisions with identically named files in those regression tests.  Convert the reference images to PIX files and update the regression tests accordingly.  For images there should be no further need for 'asc' image storage at all, but need to investigate use of asc2pix relating to dsp data files before we can deprecate the asc2pix tool.
