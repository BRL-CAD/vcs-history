implement a new bu_snooze() function, inspired by the BeOS function of same name and nearly identical in function to usleep(3).  obviously related to nanosleep() and sleep(), implementation currently uses select() instead of having cmake function tests (which wouldn't be very helpful when compiling against standard.  that said, this very well should work on Windows too because of select().
