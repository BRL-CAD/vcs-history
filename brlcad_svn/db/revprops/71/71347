implement automatically pretty-printed usage for all the rt* commands.
included new behavior is bimodal output where commands only print a
minimal set of options by default unless the user has requested help.
when asking for help, all registered options are printed in groups.

printing happens automatically within a main usage() print function
that looks at the length of options and descriptions in order to line
up all descriptions consistently in a neat column.  it aims to fit
usage within 80 columns (at an approximate 20/60 split), putting the
descriptionon a separate line without word wrapping.

options are managed through a simple singular option() registration
interface.  reflecting the common option handling (in opt.c), defaults
that apply to (nearly) all rt* apps are registered automatically and
then each application customizes as needed.  this can include
regrouping, reordering, and hiding options.

pretty-printing logic should be adaptable to bu_opt without much
effort, probably even adapting much of usage.cpp as-is, but will
require some thought on how to best adopt support for groupings and
levels.  in addition to high-level groupings (e.g., "Raytrace
Options:") and short/long verbose levels, of additional consideration
will be the concise grouping of help strings for related options
(e.g., "-w and -n").
