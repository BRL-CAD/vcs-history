The hardcoding of DB5_MAJORTYPE_BRLCAD in the rt_db_put_internal5 call in rt_db_put_internal was resulting in an incorrect binunif file being copied during a db_concat operation involving a dsp with an in-.g-file data source.  The data object was being copied, but librt would attempt to interpret the resulting object as an ARS rather than a binunif.  The rt_db_internal should have the correct major type, so just pass that along...  not sure why the DB5_MAJORTYPE_BRLCAD type was hardcoded, but it dates back to r20070 in 2001.
