Checkpoint an experiment reworking the notion of database full paths slightly.  Use PImpl imlementation hiding, allow user data associated with paths and nodes in paths, build in booleans and matrix awareness, and allow for node sharing across multiple full paths via a node pool.  Untested - just checkpointing after I got it compiling.
