add a new integration test to help ensure cross-platform correctness on large databases.  this is particularly important on platforms like Windows where 64-bit compilation still results in 32-bit int/longs.  currently, it makes the database large by setting a large title, which is unfortunately not handled very efficiently (up to 4 or 5 copies are made of the title string as attributes are copied by value and serialized to disk) but does the trick well enough.  heavily I/O bound, it's an interesting disk and memory test too (Mac laptop clocks at 10/25/45/60/87 seconds respectively for 1/2/3/4/5 GB runs).
