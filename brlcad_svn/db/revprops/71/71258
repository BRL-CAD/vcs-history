Add functions to get per region stats for volume and mass; Postpone the freeing of reg_tbl to analyze_free_current_state - we need reg_tbl to get region info after raytracing; Store the number of regions in current state and add a public function to get the number of regions - helps to iterate the reg_tbl without rtip->HeadRegion; Store the region name to reg_tbl for printing afterwards in libged
