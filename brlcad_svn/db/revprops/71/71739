throttle lingering ogl framebuffers so they don't burn up CPU when rendering completes.  previously handled events as fast as possible in a tight loop, now checking every 50ms (polling ~20 times per second).  this makes for vastly better power consumption on laptops as well as freeing up cores even on desktops, particularly with multiple lingering windows.
