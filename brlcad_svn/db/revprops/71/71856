Add an MGED 'lint' command to find and report various problems in a .g database.  In the long run this might actually be a good place to put functionality like rtcheck and gqa's overlap testing, and it definitely needs more checks for things like twisted arbs and other invalid primitive definitions, but for the moment start with a few basic tests for cyclic paths, missing objects and invalid BoTs. (fixed case typo)
