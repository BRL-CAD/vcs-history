Modify all the rt commands to allow more simplified control over
logging verbosity via the -v flag.  Previously taking a hex like debug
flags, it now requires no argument letting the user increase verbosity
by specifying -v multiple times (e.g., -vvv).

It will still take a specific value too, which is convenient for
unsetting defaults (i.e., -v0) or turning on a specific high flag
before increasing lower flags (e.g., -v0x1000000 -v).

NOTE: this begs for applications to logically manage logging better,
to group related log and/or debug messages into sets, up to four total
sets (bits 0-7, 8-15, 16-23, and 24-31) as verbosity increases 8 bits
at a time.

rt currently still defaults to -1 (all bits set, all logging enabled).
