remove all traces of rt's -d depth option where it would write out the
pixel depth as 8-byte double data interleaved in the .pix data stream.
this was referred to as "pixd" data, and had just terrible usability
and implementation implications.  depth should have just been written
to a separate file.  the pixdsplit utility was provided to separate
the image data from the depth data, but testing indicated that this
quirky feature was broken and the .pixd manual page is missing,
presumably removed earlier for being weird.  thus per change policy,
it is being removed wholesale as minimally impacting.
