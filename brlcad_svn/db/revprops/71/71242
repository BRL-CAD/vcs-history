fix conversion to/from rgb char arrays.  per typical convention and
several of the other existing functions, color values should be in a
0.0-to-1.0 range when stored/accessed as floating point and 0-to-255
range when stored/accessed as unsigned chars.

unit tests were merely checking if it retrieved the value that was
stored, so it didn't catch this.  now does an extraction as rgb chars
instead of peaking directly into the struct.
