prioritizing the compilation install directory over the runtime directory causes bad behavior when running from a build directory and with relocated binaries.  original concern was injection vulnerabilities, but that just requires current dir to be after install dir or not checked at all.  while we're at it, remove searching /usr/brlcad entirely as some magic path -- that was wrong in the first place.
