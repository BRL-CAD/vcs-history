Protect against abrupt exit in the initial nmg_booltree_leaf_tess.  Keep track of the methods employed on each region so resume can actually resume and not be forced to retry (the latter may be what is desired, but in the use case of restarting a large partial completion we don't want to re-attempt already attempted failure cases.)
