bu_bomb really wants to write to stderr - since we are redirecting the bombs to a log which we may or may not display, the flush of stderr once MGED is running facetize is dumping out the bomb messages at the end of the command run.  The logging hook captures them, but doesn't unhook bu_bomb's writeing to stderr (which makes sense, since normally bu_bomb indicates something is really really wrong and it needs to make minimal assumptions while getting the word out.)  For this case, while we've set things to _ged_facetize_log_nmg, hijack stderr and reroute it to /dev/null and put it back once we're done with that particular nmg attempt to allow everything else to proceed normally.
