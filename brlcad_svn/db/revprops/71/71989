ugh, definitely warrants more cross-platform testing (double-click menu invocation on linux in particular), but this fixes a bug where the attach dialog is displayed incessantly on piped input (one per input line) as mged incorrectly deduced whether it should be in 'interactive' mode.  we now wait a 10th of a second before checking for exceptions and let a controlling terminal be a stronger indicator.  may want to consider a command-line option that unsets interactive instead of trying to auto-detect.
