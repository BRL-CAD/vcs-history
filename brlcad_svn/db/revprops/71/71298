Start of an ls code refactor.  Use bu_ptbl, start setting up to be able to optionally handle full paths as well as object names, although the latter needs considerbly more infrastructure work.  Need to look at using BSD column.c/ls.c code as a starting point for a properly generic column formatter to replace _ged_vls_col_pr4v... then we can teach our ls command more of the tricks available on the Unix command line.  Need to get the printing logic to the point where it doesn't need things like cflag or rflag - those should be handled in the generation of the ptr/path sets passed in to the printer.
