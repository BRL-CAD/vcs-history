logfile comparison is a problem specific to nirt, so that test should deal with the paths... not printing the entire run command makes log lines really confusing (at best) for other tests.  r71686 is symptomatic of the overly sensitive method of the nirt test (i.e., diffing output) -- we should always adapt on false positive failures, they're costly (like now).
