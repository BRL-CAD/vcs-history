Saran found a critical bug in rtcheck where it was losing overlaps due to bad iteration book-keeping.  when processing overlap pairs, if it found a pair in reverse -- i.e., if it had A overlaps B, C overlaps D, then found B overlapping A, it would lose everything after the reverse pair (e.g., knowledge of C overlpaping D as well as stomping on the counts for A+B overlapping).  possible copy-and-paste error, fixed in r71091.
