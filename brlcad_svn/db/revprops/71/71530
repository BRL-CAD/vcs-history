Stash some initial notes on how we might go about implementing http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/projects/fast-winding-numbers/ for BRL-CAD.  Still a fair bit about the details I don't understand yet, and unfortunately the point version of this is implemented in libigl and partially using CGAL - https://github.com/libigl/libigl/pull/810.  Might still be worth asking the author if we can use their part of the code there under MIT, although I don't know how useful it would be without libigl/CGAL...
