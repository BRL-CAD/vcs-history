Enable Bloomenthal's Implicit Surface Polygonizer as a fallback to the facetize command instead of SPSR.  Use point sampling to get an initial point and an estimate of dimension scale for the walking step size, but experimentation shows that theinitial guess might be far too large.  To automatically accomidate this (well, avoid griding completely to a standstill anyway - it still is a slow process) a timeout has been added to the polygonizer - it will bail if it detects it has been running 'too long'.  The default is 30 seconds per iteration, with the user able to override this.  With this hooked up, a straight up 'facetize -r component m35-bot' run appears to generate geometry for all non-empty objects automatically.
