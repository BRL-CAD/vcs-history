The default arb7 from make, facetized into a BoT, triggers an infinite loop in the oriented bounding box code (bb -o arb7.bot).  Stash this to use for later testing/debugging - the immediate infinite loop is in the MinAreaRectangle::find_vertex logic, but why its getting inputs that kick it into the loop will take more investigation.
