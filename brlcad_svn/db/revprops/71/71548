significantly rework the regression tests.  to improve debugging, tests now write to a single log file for all output and errors from commands, named consistently with the same filename prefix as that of the regression test (e.g., shaders.sh logs to shaders.log).  similarly, all intermediate and output files generated by each test now use the same test prefix as a consistent filename prefix (e.g., shaders.half.prj and shaders.rt), so it's trivial to figure out which files go with which tests.  also of note, tests now clean individual files immediately before creation (instead of deleting all generated files at the beginning or end) so that they are localized to where they are created -- will probably want a registration feature in library.sh to clean up at the end, but keeping this role with cmake for now.
