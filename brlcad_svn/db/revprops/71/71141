rewording as it didn't technically crash.  g_lint vs glint was causing a tcl exception.  fix required renaming to glint.  commit message was: fix MGED's overlap tool, which crashed due to the renaming of g_lint to glint in r61110.  (moved entry and reworded commit message: news items should be roughly ordered chronologically, so this one from saran belongs higher up.)
