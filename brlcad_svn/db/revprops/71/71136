cezar debugged and fixed (in r71120) fbserv regression test hanging where fbserv was getting stuck (causing ctest to time-out the test) due to select() returning -1 due to tv_usec having more than a second of time (the default refresh rate is 60s).  fix was to set tv_sec+tv_usec properly so select is happy.
