Do a little more sanity checking and open/close reporting.  Somewhat surprisingly, db_open appears to happily open a file that is not a valid .g file and return a dbip... would it make more sense to (at lesat as a default behavior) return DBI_NULL for something that db_scan reports doesn't have a proper database header?
