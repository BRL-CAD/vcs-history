Let's make the eventual intent to remove libtermio/libcursor as public APIs explicit - we need to get away from code that uses these low level terminal features.  Windows is a first class support platform now and its interactive user interface paradigms aren't built along these lines.  Commands that are non-deprecated and still using libtermio in our code: btclsh, bwish, fbzoom, fbcolor, fbpoint and pp-fb
