one expression/function/conditional per line for readability.  every major guide concurs on not combining because code is scanned vertically more.  the brevity breaks casual scope scanning (on glance, code looks indented incorrectly) requiring considerably more effort to read and can lead to logic errors on future edits (particularly with return/exit/print/die statements).
