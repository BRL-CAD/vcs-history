start unraveling the horrible whitesmith-pico indentation style that put statements on the same line as open parens (and still indenting the paren).  put the statement on the next line.  also caught a few that just had comments following the open paren, but move them down a line too.  applying auto-style formatting should clean up their indentation later.  one step closer towards global consistency..
