This should finally (re)fix the Debian and Ubuntu builds.  The problem boils down to the Debian devs insisting on modifying default upstream libtool linkage behavior.  They 
do this for performance/relinkage reasons so that rebuilding and installing a base library (like libpng) doesn't necessarily require relinking all callers.  They force 
*off* the addition of dependency libraries on the linker line by setting link_all_deplibs=no which in turn mucks havok with compilation.  Their intent seems to assume that 
all libs are installed before a binary needs to link against them so that recursive linux dynamic link lookups will find everything needed via rpaths alone.  So all of the 
dependencies listed on our (not-yet-installed) libtool archive libraries are stripped off when binaries are linked.

This fix reverts the libtool script back to the default "unknown" value for link_all_deplibs.  So libtool does properly keep track of the recursive dependency descriptions 
provided in the build files and allows binaries to link against libraries that aren't yet installed.
