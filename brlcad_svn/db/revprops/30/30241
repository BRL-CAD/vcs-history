awesome, dbi_fd is already in a struct sections marked as private (for librt only) and subject to change .. so change^Wremove it.  there are surprisingly few uses even in librt, so it seems really safe to remove the fd and avoid repeating the same bug of corrupting file pointer streams by closing their associated descriptor.  go ahead and remove it, callers can always call fileno(dbi_fp) if they really need to do unix i/o.
