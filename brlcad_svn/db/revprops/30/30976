add the -no-undefined libtool LDFLAGS flag so that libtool will ensure that all symbols in each library are resolved properly.  this helps preserve more obscure portability problems for systems like windows and aix.  required a few mods for mac os x including providing -fexceptions as a libtool -Wc compilation flag (since 1.5 strips -f options).  also pass -framework options through with -Xlinker so that libtool similarly doesn't strip them from the linkage
