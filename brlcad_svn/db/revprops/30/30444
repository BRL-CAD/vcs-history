add a distcheck and install check to make sure that the tclIndex and pkgIndex.tcl files aren't empty.  there are some configurations generating empty files when the auto_paths are not set up correctly.  the installs will seem to be just fine .. but are actually rather busted and will result in a variety of screwy run-time tcl failures when trying to use any of those routines.  also make elapsed.sh use top_srcdir for the DATE file since it's a BUILT_SOURCES file.
