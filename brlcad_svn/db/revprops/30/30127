accept markus elfring's sf patch [ 1864112 ] "Improve const-correctness" where data items that are const are so annotated.  while there are undoubtedly hundred (if not thousands) of such cases across the codebase, he provided a patch for several dozen that were in adrt, fbed, lgt, nirt, burst, and remrt.  patch was half manually applied as too much had already changed since the 7.10.4 source release it was based off of.  credit him with thanks for finally making a proper patch instead of vague notional 'questions'.
