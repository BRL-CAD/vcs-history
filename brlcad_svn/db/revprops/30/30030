sweeping string management changes to help ensure more secure/consistent null termination and bounds checking.  use bu_strlcpy/bu_strlcat where appropriate passing the size of the buffer (expected to be a NULL-terminated C-string) instead of calling strcat/strncat/strcpy/strncpy.  this lets us get rid of most of the sanity/manual null-terminations.  also update to use sizeof instead of hard-coded constants where useful.  hopefully not too many/any bugs getting introduced though the entire commit was painstakingly reviewed at least three times over and passed all manual testing as well as the regress tests.
