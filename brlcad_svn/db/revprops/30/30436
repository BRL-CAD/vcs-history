Add a new bio.h private wrapper header for consistently defining native and standard I/O interfaces provided via stdio.h, unistd.h, io.h, and fcntl.h.  remove the 300+ instances of a HAVE_UNISTD_H block throughout with a simple include of bio.h.  this change was also motivated by the need to remove all of the header includes from the windows-specific config_win32.h (so that winsock2.h can be included before windows.h cleanly).  of course, needs windows testing and perhaps a few file tweaks given how many files were modified.
