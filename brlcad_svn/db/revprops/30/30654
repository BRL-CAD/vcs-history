john added a new -k 'kutaway view' option to rt that allows users to specify a cutting plane for fast(er) computation of cutaway images that approximates the image that would be produced by actually subtracting the equivalent halfspace and potentially satisfies clock's sf bug 1812560 (Cutaway view 210x slower) but still makes this an absurd-yet-fun run-on sentence.
