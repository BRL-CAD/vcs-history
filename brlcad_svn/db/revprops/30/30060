refactor libpkg so that the windows-specific pkg_init and pkg_terminate functions should no longer be necessary.  according to the msdn docs, the functions may be called multiple times as they internally reference count the number of calls to each and deallocated on the last/matching WSACleanup that corresponds to the number of calls to WSAStartup.  the calls were moved directly into pkg_open and pkg_close (which will get picked up by all callers including fb_open) and removed from all callers.  this should fix all of the libpkg-using network apps like all of the framebuffer utilities that still need to be ported as well as more consistently now automatically ties in the cleanup call to the pkg connection closure.  hopefully this doesn't cause bob problems (i.e. it's untested.. ;)
