large conversion/specification of the fopen callers as to whether the file is binary or text in order to help the Windows port along.  Unless specifically certain that there is no binary fields or EOL assumptions in the file reading, the files are marked as binary in order to preserve format with other platforms.  also, be more consistent on using fp for fopen'd file pointers instead of fd (which would be an open'd file descriptor).
