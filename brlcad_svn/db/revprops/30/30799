talked to applin for a while and got some additional history.  it's not clear that earl actually wrote any code, but did contribute to algorithms and docs.  likewise, applin coded around 1982 (sometime before March 1983) before the code was under revision control and then stopped shortly after (circa 1984/1985) so he was BRL-only.
