fix a problem that bsd make made apparent where there were multiple rules for operators.g (direct and via .asc.g) causing a cyclic reference.  Instead, use the same build approach but create an operators.asc2g file instead of operators.g; additionally make that file dependent upon asc2g so we're sure to keep updating the lt binary wrapper as needed.
