bob, erik, and myself have all failed at reproducing the mged text flood hanging so the problem was either a ScrolledText widget Tk bug that was fixed with the upgrade to Tk 8.5 or it's sensitive to timing issues and isn't easy to provoke on fast machines.  needs to be revisited on a slow machine, but that doesn't need to hold up the release.
