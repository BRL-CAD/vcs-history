decouple liborle from libfb (and in turn from libbu) by having it provide its own RLEpixel and RLEColorMap types as well as defining RED/GRN/BLU if needed.  this should fix compilation woes being seen on some platforms (e.g. debian) under certain configurations -- particular an error related to not finding tcl.h (from bu.h from fb.h).
