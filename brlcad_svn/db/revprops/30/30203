since the directory is being pulled dynamic from bu_brlcad_data, don't pay any attention to what is in the .mgedrc (probably shouldn't write it out).  more importantly, don't use the -display option with the $mged_browser so that it'll actually work.  need some better way than calling up tcl_platform(os)...freakin fugly.  this does, however, make help finally work on mac os x.
