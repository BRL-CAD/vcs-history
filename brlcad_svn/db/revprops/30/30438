Bob fixed a bug in the X11 framebuffer interface where it would cause the entire X11 display to go black or not depending on whether the framebuffer window had focus or not.  this issue was related to a problem with the visual type and colormapping where a bad visual was being selected.  now it selects a truecolorvisual (instead of directcolor iirc).
