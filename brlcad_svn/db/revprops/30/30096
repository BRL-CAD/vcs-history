improve and clean up dbconcat's behavior, now allowing users to specify either a prefix, a suffix, no affix, or an auto-incrementing suffix/prefix when importing.  if there is a name conflict on import, the user is notified that they didn't get what they asked for.  this mod was annotated on sf bug 1816012 from david loman (dbconcat segfaults) that jra already fixed.
