remove the protections for the 'm' mode in the opengl framebuffer as well as requesting indirect buffers, now always requesting direct and seeing what we get.  my always doing 'multiple window mode', the code now (correctly) acquires and releases the opengl context for all of the drawing so that there aren't multithreaded crashes on mac and linux. bob and I tag-teamed tracking down the cause and a fix for this bug over a couple days.  interestingly, the crash on linux only occurred after he 'fixed' the linux behavior to always use a direct color map (upon which it began consistently crashing like the Mac).
