initial implementation of run-time byte order detection via bu_byteorder() that returns the current endian type.  type endian type is one of BU_BIG_ENDIAN BU_LITTLE_ENDIAN and BU_PDP_ENDIAN for now, and uses a simple union test for finding the ordering.  profiling showed that it was actually faster to compute than to lookup from a static iff the first test is the right one (which makes sense, avoids a load/read).  we need *run-time* detection in order for Universal binaries to work correctly on Mac OS X.
