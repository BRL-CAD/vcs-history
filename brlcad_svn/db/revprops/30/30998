revert 30995 as regfree does need to be defined to TclReFree else unresolved symbols on other platforms.  the problem (presumably on windows) is probably the build finding the src/other/libregex/regex.h header before tcl's from src/other/tcl/generic/regex.h; the include paths should include tcl first in order for tcl to compile its regex interface.
