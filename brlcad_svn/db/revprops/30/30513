yet one more stab at accounting for parallel make problems where the libtool wrapper script is invoked by too many threads before it has time to generate the lt-asc2g binary.  this fixes the problem by creating a lockfile mechanism that invokes asc2g first on just the operators.asc file (cause it's so damn small) before running everyone else.  seems to work like a charm though I bet there is still an exceptionally rare race condition possible if the operators.g dependency isn't handled first (it's listed as a dep so it should be first)
