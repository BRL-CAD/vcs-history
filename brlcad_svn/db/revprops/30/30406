needs some run-time testing, but apply the style changes to the tcl sources.  indent.sh did surprisingly well at about 90% correctness though it was often confused by embedded #'s in the sources.  seeing other examples, it looks like it's valid to quote the # (e.g. for upvar and #auto) and/or quote stringlists that have embeeded #'s but use {}'s.  still needs testing.
