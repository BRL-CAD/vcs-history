mged now no longer dies in an assertion failure when the geometry file is bogus.  it properly reports that things don't seem right and continues gracefully.  this handles the simple test case of 'touch file.g && mged -c file.g units m' that was bombing out.  now it detects/reports that it's a bogus geometry file and marks the file read-only.
