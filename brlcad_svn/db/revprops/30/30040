refactor the bu_fchmod interface to only take a FILE * instead of the filename as that has the same security vulnerability as calling chmod() does.  remove the chmod() call in the implementation as that was just done for Windows where fchmod() or a secure equivalent doesn't seem to be available.  instead, punt by doing what cygwin does.  just ignore the request and pretend it failed.  might want to pretend it succeeded, but good as anything for now.
