and the test case cube is now working.. apparently something isn't being specified correctly if the right face curves (which were all intentionally specified in reverse order) even after accounting for the edge reversal when making the edge trimming loops.  still have to figure out why that wouldn't work, but everything does seem to make sense and even renders correctly when the curves have the intended direction.
