move MAX_PSW from machine.h over to bu.h, fixing the value at 1024 for now (the max value present in machine.h).  this makes that the hard limit on number of procs/threads that may be spawned at a minor (trivial) memory expense when not in full use.  ray-trace performance does not seem to be affected by the size of the tables.
