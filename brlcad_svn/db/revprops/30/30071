Bob fixed PIX image file creation bug on Windows .. this fixes a problem with many of the pix and framebuffer tools that render directly to a pix file via libfb.  the problem was the file was not opened in 'binary mode', which is required on windows or it will perform EOL translations (wreaking all sorts of havoc of course with a pix image)
