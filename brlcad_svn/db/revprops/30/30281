remove/refactor DEFAULT_PSW from machine.h so that now it's really just up to rt_avail_cpus() to report the max and up to the user to decide how many.  the default is now consistently set the same for everyone to the number of processors available.  if someone needs to re-port to an old CRAY and specifying -P1 from userland isn't sufficient, we can refactor a bu_default_cpus() routine with better logic.  one step closer to removing machine.h
