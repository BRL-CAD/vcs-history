Erik made nirt's -b backout option use the model's bounding sphere as the backout distance instead of the hard-coded 1000 define and also made it use a much simpler backout method by just backing up the original ray being fired by the model's bounding sphere size.  vaguely recall there being a request regarding nirt's backout behavior, but don't see any hint of it.  think it might have been a verbal request/inquiry.
