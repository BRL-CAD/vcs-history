annotate the results of the OpenGL framebuffer bug hunt.  the problem seems to be directly related to SMP processing with the ogl framebuffer interface.  with PARALLEL turned off, it works just fine; with it on, the app crashes during the first OpenGL write call into the glx context likely indicating that either the context initialization is invalid (perhaps needing to occur per-thread) or data needs to be semaphore protected.  either way, enough progress was made to push the interface back another release since the specific cause is still unclear.
