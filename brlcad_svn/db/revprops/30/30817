make HOST, PATH, USER, and DATE depend on brlcad_config.h so that the values reset every time configure is run.  this way the date stamp and build system should match whomever is performing the build for source dist builders instead of the maintainer that made the distribution tarball.  the downside is more frequent rebuilds of everything for internal devs.
