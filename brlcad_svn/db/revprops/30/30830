only warn about the string truncation if debug is turned as it is indeed entirely valid for the src string in strlcpy to be longer than size.  this check was mainly added because there was a slew of strncpy code migrated over and the truncation by the new strlcpy wasn't intentional (or desirable).  there are undoubtedly more callers that need to be weeded out.
