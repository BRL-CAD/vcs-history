NATURAL_IEEE and REVERSE_IEEE are no longer used.  instead, try to utilize the bu_byteorder() run-time checks now where possible or WORDS_BIGENDIAN where not feasible.  while this doesn't change the behavior of htond and htonf, care needs to be taken for the floating point format not being what we expect.  make the configure test warn more verbosely if we encounter something that may not be ieee 754 floating point format (which in turn might imply htond and/or htonf need modification, the other known floating types aren't even used).
