add a new -u units option support to rtarea so that users can specify the desired output units.  announce clearly that the output format of rtarea is subject to change soon as is the terminology being used.  this is in preparation of addressing other user requests to fix the naming conventions, default units (using local units), and support for additional output formats (tables).  this feature was requested by _many_ (most?) modelers and analysts.
