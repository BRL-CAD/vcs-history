woo hoo! the performance problems were simply because several of the glXMakeCurrent acquire/release pairings were .. wrong.  rather, they're in the wrong place with respect to the logic sometimes only acquiring in a specific scope but then releasing in a different scope.  made them all consistent and sure enough it all behaves spiffily now .. yay for the return of the ogl framebuffer.
