Major change in the way ellipses are used to model sides.  Instead of 1 rotated ellipse per side, use two non-rotated ellipses for the top of the sides and a single ellipse to take care of the bottom half of both sides.  Mathematical solver code is unchanged since it is quite general, but additional ellipses are being solved for and inputs should constrain them to be non-rotated.  This method should have the potential to guarantee a specific tire width and may (with some more work) be more flexible for unusual tire sizes.
