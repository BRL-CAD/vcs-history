add protections and notification to users that installing into /usr is generally a pretty bad idea (particularly for those linux folks).  require that they interactively confirm that they would like to continue (by having them type 'yes'/'no').  there is probably additional specific checks that could be added to make sure libdir and prefix aren't different, but it's a good first stab.
