remove MALLOC_NOT_MP_SAFE from machine.h, moving it to src/libbu/malloc.c and enabling it for all platforms.  there were only a few old platforms that were not specifically set as malloc-not-mp-safe and it's not clear which of those were actually verified as safe so just turn it on for all for now.
