make the wgl interface do the same as the ogl interface, fixing the various incorrectly scoped wglMakeCurrent calls so that they actually pair up correctly with the logic.  also, actually make them release the context (the code was wrong, they just kept it) so when parallel support is added to windows, it'll actually work.
