Woo hoo.. machine.h is now gone.  Refactor the last bit for defining PARALLEL by making a configure --enable-parallel option (which defaults to yes for now) with aliases for --enable-parallel-build, --enable-smp, and --enable-smp-build.  only other bit remaining was sgi/mips settings, but at least irix6 does set them both with gcc and mipspro so they should be fine.
