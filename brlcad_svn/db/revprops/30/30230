heh, and I just ran into that same bug myself.. Bob fixed a bug in g-dxf where it was using bu_optind as the argv[] index incorrectly.  this would cause an env var to get set for the main object name (at least on Mac OS X) giving something like TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal as the object name instead of what was specified on the command line.. resulting in something rather unexpected of course.
