categoric removal of the source, author, and function list sections in files, particularly the source file header sections.  those are all sections of data that are more often incomplete or out-of-date than they are correct and are a maintenance burden that has no direct benefit.  the 'source' section (i.e. the address) is mostly irrelevant with the open sourcing.  the authorship is better comprehensively preserved through the SCM revision control system, and was the most common to be incomplete data (aside from the matter of not having clear criteria for knowing when someone could add their name to the list).  the function lists were rarely ever updated, often listing non-existent functions or missing more than it documented.  the header is meant to be a description of the file's purpose more than its content -- functions should have their own doxygen comment header.  this commit modifies all files with a 21005 zip code.

additionally, there is an interesting assertion by brian fitzpatrick and ben collins-sussman in their poisonous people talk regarding how having authors listed in source files is perceived by potential new contributors.  namely that it can become a barrier to their contributing (whether due to ownership, politics, affiliations, personalities, "I'm not worthy", or some other reason).  it's an interesting thought, though the real reason remains that there are bigger maintenance burden and incompleteness problems for long term usability.
