John made an interesting observation this afternoon, and remarked that
nmg_break_3edge_at_plane(hit_pt, eu1, fu2) breaks it's edge (eu1) at
the plane intersect point (hit_pt), even if hit_pt falls OUTSIDE all the
loops of the face (fu2).
This is not an unexpected behavior, but I put a call to the
classifier in, just to double check.
