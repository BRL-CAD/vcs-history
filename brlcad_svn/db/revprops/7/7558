Completed moving the set magic number in structure to where the
structure was actually "good".  Reordered many of the structure
initializations to follow structure definitions (or inverse) and to
help keep the initializations localized.  Added general comments.
Started to prepare for removal of vertex(use) stealing.  Made special
case of vertex in shell call to nmg_ml become a call to nmg_mlv().
