When intersecting two faces, can't search other face for a likely
vertex, need to search the other shell.  Otherwise, this can lead to
nmg_region_v_unique():  2 verts are the same, within tolerance
because the necessary vertex already exists, but in another face.
(Typically a radial face).
Changed from nmg_find_pt_in_face() to nmg_find_pt_in_shell().
