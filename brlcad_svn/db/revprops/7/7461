Changed nmg_class_pt_s() so that it searches all faces for an ON
condition before dropping into the ray tracing (Jordan Curve Theorem)
strategy, since (a) this is a more accurate way to answer the question,
and (b) the ray tracing isn't sophisticated enough to handle the
ray/edge classification question that can come up when the projected
(intersection) point is ON an edge.
