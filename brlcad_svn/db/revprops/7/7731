The  "start vertex is topologically on the other
face" fast-test code was only reasonable if the edge is non-coplanar
with the face.  If the edge lies in the face, then special 2D handling
is required, as there can be arbitrary many points of intersection
between the edge and the face.
Code reorganized to defer the start point's topology check until after the test for co-planarity was
performed.
