Fixed bugs in zoomed-in mode of "sgi_bwrite" so that the shared memory
	copy of the image is written correctly, and the screen is drawn
	properly.
Fixed bugs in windowing logic of "sgi_repaint" so that the image is
	drawn in the proper place when the window center is greater than
	the image center in X or Y and the off-image portions of the
	screen are blanked out.
Added "sgi_rectf_pix" function to neaten up the off-image blanking
	code.

END
