Fixed bug related to initializing shared memory. "sgi_repaint" was getting
called indirectly from "sgi_getmem" before the window state variables were
set, so that the "SGI(ifp)->si_[xy]zoom" were zero, and "sgi_repaint" would
divide by them causing a floating point exception.  This was done correctly
in the RGB mode portion of the code.  Therefor, it only occured while under
MEX, after a reboot (so that shared memory would be initialized), and when
I had had a rough morning...
