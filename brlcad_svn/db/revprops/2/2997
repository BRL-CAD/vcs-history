On SGI 4-D release 2, there are no function prototypes.
On SGI 4-D release 3, function prototypes exist, and are used
in math.h, but __STDC__ is NOT defined.

Worse, on SGI 4-D release 2, giving the type of the argument
results in that symbol becomming globally known.
Hence, the change from "x" to "_sqrt_arg_x".
This seems to keep everything happy.
I HATE SGI!!!
