added getopt, variable screen size, stroke descriptor free lists
with large mallocs, single_banded mode, cleanup up a little code
and some documentation - lots of good stuff!
Note: -t thickness now means width in pixels, not number of extra pixels.
ToDo: thick points, square aspect on nonsquare screens(?)
