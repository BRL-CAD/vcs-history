Added logging and (bounces omitted) code to max bounces exceeded
case.  Improved code which handles max internal reflections
to just continue on in the same direction.
Both fixes cause quenched rays to assume the color of SOME part of
the sceen, rather than just picking a color for them.
Also added code to look for small cracks in glass, and fuse them.

END
