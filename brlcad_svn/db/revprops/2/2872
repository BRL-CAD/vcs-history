Added -z switch to turn off shadows and changed f_Model and f_Region
	so that when inside a solid, the surface normal is the reverse
	of the ray direction.  Now report surface normal from f_Region.
Converted to use of librt/machine.c rather than lgt module resource.c
	and also adopted rt_parallel() from machine.c.
