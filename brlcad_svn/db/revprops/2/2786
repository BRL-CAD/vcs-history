Fixed bug in hit routines: by using a tolerance of 0.1 mm for hits
behind the ray origin and tossing them out small objects were not
being rendered.  Also, the logic for recovering from this could
cause the pt_outhit of the pt_headp to be accessed erroneously.
The tolerance was decreased to 0.01mm and placed in BEHIND_ME_TOL
with common macro Get_Partition used everywhere.
