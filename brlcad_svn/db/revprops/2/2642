First pass over Sun 3/50 support.  Improvements include bug fixes to
sun_bwrite (while zooming), and support for the following;  sun_bread,
sun_window_set, sun_zoom_set, sun_cmemory_addr, sun_cscreen_addr,
sun_cmread, sun_cmwrite.  The use of shared memory ala if_sgi.c was
implemented, but the max window size limited to 512x512 as a default
due to only 4 Megs. of memory on typical 3/50s.  This was almost a
total rewrite with the exception of the color Sun support which was
left intact as much as possible.
