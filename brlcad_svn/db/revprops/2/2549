Both known difficulties are now resolved:
-- hollow glass
-- hitting right on the edge.
Error handling has been significantly cleaned up, and the reasoning
behind the tests explained.
rr_hit now returns one of three outcomes, good, bad, or push on.
Lowered bounce and i_reflect limits to conserve CPU time;  images
seem just as nice with 3&5, rather than the previous 4&9.
Only remaining known problem is lack of Refractive Index tracking
from region to region -- this causes bogus inclusion of reflection
rays at the interface.
