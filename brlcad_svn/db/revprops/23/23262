fix a IA64 crash bug where string functions were not getting a prototype due to USE_STRINGS and the implicit integer to pointer cast the compiler does by assuming the function returns an int obliterates the upper bits of the address (which is actually used on IA64).  don't cause a tiny memory leak by loosing track of a static const char array too while we're at it in units.
