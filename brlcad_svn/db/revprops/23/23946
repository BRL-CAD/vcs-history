if a secondary autoconf fails with an error saying that AC_PROG_LIBTOOL is missing, pull the misc/libtool.m4 in as an acinclude.m4 and restart the configuration.  this should allow a successful autogen on systems that have a libtool that's already moved forward to LT_INIT or otherwise don't have the AC_PROG_LIBTOOL macro.
