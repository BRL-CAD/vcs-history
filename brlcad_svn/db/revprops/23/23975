separate out the tests for a clobbered INSTALL/COPYING file into their own m4/restore.m4 using a BC_RESTORE_CLOBBERED macro function.  it takes two optional arguments for the files to check and the directory off of the srcdir to find them in.  if the files have a revision id, those take precedence over a content difference in the backup.
