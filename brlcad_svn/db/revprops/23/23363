backed out changes introduced to divide mostly empty cells in the space partitioning grid into empty and non-empty cells.  This was a performance tweak which has introduced a difference in MUVES output when processing overlapping regions because the order in which solids/regions/segments/partitions are processed is now different.  When the default overlap handler is called, and no other criteria are available to choose the "winning partition" it picks (arbitrarily) the first one in the list.  This ordering is based upon the order in which the partitions were created, which in turn is based upon the order in which the primitives were intersected.  By having a different order in the space partition cell list of objects, we were seeing a different outcome in the "winner" of the overlap contest.
