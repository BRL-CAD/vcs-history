added bu_strdupm() which takes a purpose string in addition to the ptr to be dup'd, so that the reporting can be
similar to bu_malloc() and friends when debugging is turned on.

Changed the logging in bu_realloc() so that it reports the old address as well when realloc() moves the memory.  This helps people who are manually looking through the logs at memory usage patterns.
