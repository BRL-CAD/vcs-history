add a libtool.m4 just in case the compiling user has a libtool installed that's already converted to LT_INIT or a setup that is otherwise missing the AC_PROG_LIBTOOL macro.  it's not a good idea to put the libtool.m4 into the m4/ directory as that may cause automake variable mismatch bugs (where the libraries end up missing their extensions) when there's a suitable system libtool.m4 already.
