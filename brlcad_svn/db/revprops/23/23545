Changes to allow BRLCAD to be relocated after installation.  We now look in
the installed path, and ONLY IF THAT ISN'T FOUND do we look at the BRLCAD_ROOT
environment variable.  This will allow the AJEM folks to run BRLCAD from
anywhere (since their installer wraps ajem in a script that sets all the
necessary environment variables) while still eliminating the problem we have
at ARL with people running one version of BRLCAD with the scripts and
libraries from another version of BRLCAD.

With luck, this is the last !@#$%^ patch before Release 7.0 is really, truly
actually absolutely out the door.
