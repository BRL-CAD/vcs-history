revert back to making the build system use the pro-e-provided makefile.  this assumes cc, that the build has successfully make libbu, libbn, and libtcl, and that the build is occuring relative to the top_srcdir in ../.. (i.e. building from the pro-engineer dir).  the libraries are linked static so that they may be included in a 64bit release as well.
