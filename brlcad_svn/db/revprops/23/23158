We are Borg, resistance is futile, you will be assimilated.  Convert tcl/tk's build to ours instead of continuing to live with the build issues their build imposes.  Also, make the cache file really work automatically now -- if the configure script hasn't changed, it will utilize the cache.  Make usage of the lib var names be more consistent; check for -lz and -lm.
