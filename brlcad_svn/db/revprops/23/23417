add --enable-64bit-build flag with a variety of aliases so that we attempt to guess and use the proper compiler flags.  IRIX/IRIX64 hack is moved and modified to become enabled when that flag is given.  also, remove the Build Tk status line for now since for the forseeable future we need to always build it until someone decouples tkCanvBezier or they accept the patch.

END
