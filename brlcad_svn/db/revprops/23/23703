massive rewrite and reorganization.  Additional meat about BRL-CAD history and future, about how large the package is and what is contained, more details on compiling and installation, how to submit bug reports, join the mailing lists, submit feature requests, find the devs via IRC, contact info, and more with a lil table of contents too.
