An example of how to write an application that uses librt to load geometry and
shoot rays using one of the original programming languages: FORTRAN.  Amazingly
enough, some people still like and use this dialect for writing software.  Like
the cockroach, FORTRAN will be with us until the end of time.  Perhaps we should
be grateful.
