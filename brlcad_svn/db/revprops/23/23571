after letting the major edits settle for a few days, a revisted review reveals several necessary changes.  of note are to checkout/update using -z9, the exact format of HEAD merge tags (was wrong), usage of status -v, fixed example of merging a branch, added example of merging HEAD into a branch, emphasis of checkout -P, binary flag on binary files, and a slew of engrish rewordings.
