fix problem where an unspecified prefix configure resulted in an INSTALL_DIRECTORY set to NONE, causing mged/libbu to not find it's resources.  rename INSTALL_DIRECTORY back to BRLCAD_ROOT, but perform checks and make warnings if it's set at the time of configure.  abort if both bc_root is set and --prefix mismatch.

END
